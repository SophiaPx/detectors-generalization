"The Hell's Angels did come out the losers in this movie. Sonny stated to the director that NOBODY does this to the Angles and gets away with it. His version was the two dudes were to be shotgunned to death, but his suggestion was ignored. They were stoops to even appear, much less be ""technical advisers"" in a stink-bomb of a movie like this. Hell's Angles on JAP bikes? C'mon! (although in Sonny's autobiography he says, ""F$#K Harley Davidson!"" and that if they was smart, they would be riding Hondas."|1
I saw the movie on its North American premiere (July 14, 2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was slightly disappointed as I had been expecting a more epic, ensemble cast movie along the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead, the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Still, the movie was solid, thoughtful and visually intriguing. There were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties, intrigue and blood, versus the lighter, more flamboyant, martial arts sequences.|1
Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all of television. If you've never seen 30 Minute Meals, then you cannot possibly begin to comprehend how unfathomably annoying she is. I really truly meant that you can't even begin to be boggled by her until you've viewed the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is mostly with her mannerisms as you might have guessed. Ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot.|1
Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal ' way , once with the scenes in consecutive frames, once in each frame, and then again a few minutes later. And then watched this with my friends again - and I'm happy to admit it is my favorite in the whole DVD series because it's just as amazing as any of the others! I just wish I had the time and resources I needed to write it. This is what the movie is all about - the characters. What is it about the characters that made it into the film?|0
I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through.|1
Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. The script for James 'Jimmy' Trivette, Walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as Wesley Crusher on Star Trek TNG, and is played with about as much conviction.On this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless Walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). That's not how life works, that's not how people are.|1
I 've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise . A Christmas Classic , it 's the most famous Christmas movie ever to be found. I'm really really excited for this Christmas movie, so I think it 'll be a lot better for me after watching it but I have to admit it 'll be a lot better for the kids than anything else I've seen. It was actually quite entertaining to watch as I 'll have to do a bit before I get home and then watch the movie again tomorrow.|0
Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path. However, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice. The story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time.|1
I know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am going to anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laugh never came, so I gave up.It's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It isn't anywhere near that high grade. Let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. They may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't.|1
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the local movie theater. I loved it, but then I was in college, I didn’t really know why it was there, I watched it a few years ago and I thought “this is great. This is what Tarantino had to say, and he didn’t get it. He just thought he’d be able to do it anyway.” And that was the only time I ever saw a movie with a guy that was in the movie theater.|0
"So , you wan na be a rock star ? See this movie . You do n't like rock , but that's not your real name. That is your real one . But a rock star may be called . You may not think of rock , but the real one is like the rock . A rock star is a great singer. He's a singer and a songwriter , and he sings a song , but he's also a singer and a song writer. A:

If he's a rock star, then he's probably the one that came up with this song."|0
There seems to have been some money behind this film , but it would be impossible to imagine a film which was actually written after the fact. Yes, I know, I know. It would be impossible to tell the story from the film. If you want to know what the story is, you can take a look at my previous article. Yes, I know... I know. I've been looking for it for a while. It's great to know about the work done by other people. I've heard from a number of people I can't recall who's done a similar movie.|0
I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking, but was I wrong. This film was boring, especially in the beginning and the middle parts. I cannot comment on the ending because I just couldn't stand watching the whole film. The premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film. So if you are having trouble with sleep then I recommend that you rent this film.|1
"Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack : I 'd give it ( soundtrack ) a 9 out of 10, but i really would love it and I just hope it works better than I do :D

For me it works well if i go back to the movie but in my house i'm going to change my mind and buy a copy of it so i can be back to the movie but for sure i'll give it a 9 out of 10, but it's not my dream

I wish I would say it works great in my house."|0
"In `` Red Letters '' , Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a local newspaper to get some ideas about his work. As Coyote begins the day-to-day operation he writes an essay on his writing. As Coyote arrives to his hotel, he is shocked to hear the news from a journalist in his native town. As Coyote reads the piece, he is told it contains ""some very funny things."" When Coyote is told what he has read, he is taken aback. The newspaper says it contains humor about him."|0
Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it's just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience.|1
"Well...it's about time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years. The plot isn't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool. But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme is back to doing martial arts again. His latest films have been more acting oriented, but in ""The Shepard"", JCVD is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape."|1
It 's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS : RED without the 's, with the 't and the 's and the 't 's. And then, because I'm a child of the 's and I haven't a clue why I'm thinking about them yet, I'll ask for their review anyway, which will take me about two weeks to do, and then I'll write it, which I know I don't do. After that, they'll tell me that I'll probably never have a chance to finish my 's, even if they ask me.|0
I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view and discuss this topic. Thank you so much for being so helpful. I appreciate that. I hope this post has given you a head start on what happens in the world of computers. I would like to take it as an attempt to explain what we do when we become a computer. I want to share an article with you. I'm going to tell you more about how I became an engineer by taking a look at what you're doing in the first few years of college.|0
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch. With such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. The excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. The flash-backs were clumsy. The characters were one-dimensional. The heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. The movie Nobody's Fool, based on another novel by Russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. The photography in Empire Falls was lovely.|1
"After the failure of `` Hellraiser III : Hell On Earth , '' the chapter that served as a kind of soundtrack for the upcoming '' Hellraiser!'' video came to life. ''Hellraiser 3 : Hell On Earth'' came out on June 19, but the game never got released. The movie ''Hellraiser!'' would be released just over a month after the game had debuted, the same day of the launch. As the release date approached, I got an idea of what the game would do for a couple of reasons. First and foremost:

There are two main reasons to be excited about Hellraiser!"|0
This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to Hollywood movies! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha couldn't have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... Bottom line, I hated the movie.|1
Monday, October 02, 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do. We ordered some Japanese take-out, turned off the lights and pushed play. I'm an avid fan of horror movies. However, The Cavern released on DVD this October was most certainly a let down. It seemed promising, meeting all the standard requirements of any horror movie machine: drawn out beginning with antagonistic character present, a cannot be omitted sex scene, and the all too familiar pre-spook (when they spook you unexpectedly but it turns out to be the idiot buddy).|1
The positives : It 's shot pretty well . Has some interesting peripheral characters . Likable main character ( albeit not the best ) . The other ones , are very good and they have nice voice. Also they are pretty cute , and are fun to watch. But there is something different about that . So they are not much better than some of these characters . They do look a little weird . They also have some interesting voice . I like the voice . They have good characters and some nice characters but these characters have nothing to do with this .|0
Except for the glossy look , this show had little to recommend it . The writing was patronizing and convoluted as well , like in the original . But there were so many interesting things here, that you may want to give some credit for the quality. In my view , it would be a bit more difficult to keep the cast in line, but there is not that much to do . I have done some great shows in various genres, but I have always liked the stylistic aspects . However , I found the show was more enjoyable for me than I expected.|0
Or vice-versa.This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker ( Jules Dassin ) who had to flee Italy because he was being chased by Italian security forces as he was in his final months. The film follows a French family who has moved to New York to be with their daughter, and a French girl who is still in love with the young man they love. But this is not the whole story but the story of how they got there. A family of French-speaking people, they are in the midst of making a film.|0
They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit. How darethey? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad acting. The only character i felt sympathy for was the oneplayed by Angela Schijf. Her acting was the best in the whole film. The story could've been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful filmed (lights and camera), (theopening scene for example), but the bad acting made the magicdisappear.I really don't understand why so many people voted this film sogood.|1
"What can I say? After having read Herbert's books and loving Lynch's movie version, I was extremely disappointed. I felt I was watching a reject version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like left overs from a Star Wars TV special! I felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. The costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s Flash Gordon, pulp feel. The worms! They're supposed to be Sand Worms and yet they appeared to ""big stalagtites"" with a mouth at the blunt end. The effects in general were pretty second rate."|1
I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I ca n't understand why, I just saw it on the news in the UK in the middle of the week. I did a quick Google search, but I didn't find anything. It's all over the papers, the media, the internet and social media. It makes me nervous when someone does it. In my opinion, the most important issue of the documentary is the political implications of what we have seen. When I watched it a year ago, I don't think I have seen that film much since.|0
As a fan of Henriksen ( I liked him in the `` Millennium '' series ) and of course Lorenzo, I think he can be a really interesting player to have in his team. There are some people who don't like him, and I'm not saying they don't like him, but I wouldn't rule it out either. There was a lot of debate among the players in the past about when to sign him/his coach, and he's still a great player. He's an incredible player, so if you don't like him, don't even bother trying.|0
This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos . It is the kind of dream I am often told I never really know. But I do know it is not the kind of dream that can actually be described. If you watch movies in which they were filmed in the '80s, or even in their earliest years, I am sure you will get a bit of interest. For instance, I was asked to shoot a scene in which two young children were walking down a dirt street, each looking like a person walking with a flashlight.|0
Journalist Bob Woodward 's blistering , scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi 's rise and fall becomes the central tenet of The New Yorker in 2009 . At the end of 2009, Belushi , who was in Hollywood as a director and playwright , was killed in a car accident that left him in serious physical and mental impairment. Belushi 's widow was found dead the following year on December 8, 2011 at the age of 64 . In the aftermath, it is likely that at some point he decided to take a break from film filmmaking and started a documentary series of his own.|0
I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci 's character in this film . If she was supposed to have lost his love for her then she had no choice but to leave him . . . . I love Ricci, but if she wasn't supposed to be so loving to him then she would be missing him . . . . I know that it would have been better for her to have been the one to come to this film. She had not lost her husband yet, but she has. If we do not understand what she is supposed to do then we cannot help her.|0
"This movie is #1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen, with ""Lessons for an Assassin"" on the #2 spot.The acting is lousy (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even your performance was horrible! ), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. But contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action in this one."|1
"If you enjoy riddles and suspense, you will enjoy this movie. Truth be told it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up, I knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out ""the reason"" and gets involved in ""the game"" by solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, also a riddle fanatic, and also gets entangled in the game."|1
OK .... so , by minute 15 in the film , there 's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me as well. The dialogue for the first film, which was very good (which was not that bad). After that it 's the only one not bad. And there 's no dialogue and I have to tell that. I'm sure I can make the film work without the dialogue. What 's going to happen here? I can't make the film. I cannot make it work. It looks good, but I don't know that it will do much.|0
I grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc, These movies constitute my childhood. When these movies came on, not only myself but whoever I was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30, talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend. I don't think words could express the amount of excitement Zoog Disney brought.|1
Reba is a very dumb show . You can predict pretty much anything that 's about to happen . Barbra Streisand, who's got so much talent in a show like that . And if the show doesn 't work out, who would 've been able to take over . It's not much fun , and it's not really that important . You can 't even go to the end and take over a show . . . The only thing I can guarantee . It's not easy . . . . It's not easy . . . .|0
This film is terrible - honestly . The acting is terrible , the script made me cringe , the effects are terrible . The music and lyrics are awful . The soundtrack is awful , the soundtracks are bad . It's the only film I've seen which has been very bad in the reviews I've seen , it's terrible and the writing and music is terrible . I love music but the way the film is directed and it is directed is horrible . I don't like how the music is awful . The film is a mess . It is a very bad movie .|0
I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster 's . I saw this film when I was a child, I thought it was awful. I remember it being a really big movie. That is because, when I was a teenager, there were a lot of teenage movies in my life, the most important of which was this movie. I would watch it a little bit before I got older and I think that it was the biggest movie of my childhood. I never knew how good Jodie Foster was and I probably never would have seen it.|0
"This is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by ""Friday the 13th"". ""The Prey"" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. The woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.But ""The Prey"" is as bad as you might expect. I didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.Well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of Jason."|1
In general , I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I 'm afraid of everything for the first time in years. However , I know horror movies have their own flaws , and sometimes the worst thing to happen is you get stuck in the film, and no one wants to take you down for that. I am a horror gamer with an obsession with horror and I hope that this blog will make you enjoy horror movies more than anything else. And now, I have to share my review for the video game genre .|0
"It's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but ""Caligula"" surely must hold this title. I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar ""Caligula"" to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg."|1
My mom and I, rented this movie. I mean, we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks, whether they be big Hollywood flicks or Indy flicks.But oh, we were fooled!! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small city in Texas. Halfway through, all the sudden things get all christain on us. My mom and I believe in god and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie was preaching it, made it annoying. All I really have to say, is that we are Christian, but even we like to have fun.|1
You do n't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it is you've got on TV, which I've never watched in a month! It's a lot of fun watching something like this, and I don't know if you would've watched the second movie in this series, because they are so funny! Oh god, that movie has nothing on it, because I can't believe I don't have one on my shelf. How do you know if this is what I'd be seeing?|0
This is strictly for Pryor fans . Just because he was a great , funny guy does n't mean this is a work in progress . I like him as a writer. If you're a fan of his, then I think you are not going to like him. I don't know why I would. He seems like such an incredible writer, and a fantastic person to work with. But for him, the time has come . He needs time to prepare for the next season. You say he needs time to prepare for the next season? Is that the correct word?|0
Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart: I would say this is certainly the best of the 80's teen-sex-comedies, but that is a back-handed compliment. This is a good movie, period. It is very specific in time and place--nearly twenty years later this is a marvelous snapshot--yet its story remains timeless. (This is just Romeo and Juliet, minus the death, after all!) Nicolas Cage is wonderful, showing all the early promise that, it turns out, he has squandered on overblown action crapola.|1
Wow! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for all those insomniacs (lord knows they'd probably pass out from boredom watching this movie) Terrible acting, the killer is quite far from scary, I've seen clowns at carnivals that were scarier. Lot's of unnecessary 'skin' in this film, pseudo-porn scenes which are just horrible in more ways than a million, a gawdy soap opera style script which really hurt the movie and the director really had no flair for whatever genre he was trying to create with this film.|1
I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell.But the movie is almost awful, first 30 minutes are interesting, but then.... like almost all new movies they blow it up. I don't get the idea, why that kid died? ?Is a cliché, every nigga' movie must have a kid to be killed, and everybody must become good after his death.LOL.I don't understand what is the connection with the movie... And is so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes.Nothing new in this movie.|1
"Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out the sister is part of a Jim Jones type religous cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. This is another (!) cannibal movie, and I probably would have liked it if not for Lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior ""The Man from Deep River."""|1
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter.Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too....Villain-y.|1
"Surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer (supposedly in his first lead role in a feature) as an unconventional Navy sub commander who wants to run a nuclear sub of his own, however; he has earn it by competing against the U.S. Navy in a series of war-games with a crew of untested, questionable, and lovable men (and a woman, too).Director David S. Ward (""Major League"") and his writers have put together a hysterically clever and upbeat comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well."|1
This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving of 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The oldest son has just comeback from Vietnam and he is having a hell of time readjusting to the life he had left behind. And the family does not know how to handle the problem. I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is one the most heart-wrenching war films I've seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the entire movie.|1
* * Might contain spoilers * * Ok , lets conclude this movie in one word : bad . Two things * * It might be a bad movie if you don't like it (in this case) . But * * No, that's not it .

In the mid 1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (as Daniel Morgan) emigrates to Australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself branded, and thrown in a torturous prison; there, he is gang-raped. Upon release, Hopper hooks up with aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic Bill Hunter (as Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring), and others. Eventually, vengeance becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities.|1
Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war II on the eastern front. Characters well portrayed and unforgettable. One episode leaves you wishing for the next. Pay attention to the closing credits were the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An untold story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialog. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a most terrible time.|1
His music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow. From around the time of Bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get. -Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but that tempo wouldn't be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is PROPERLY played at a snail's pace.|1
Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan, I have to say that this film while not awful, just didn't make me care at all... and it all just seemed to be out of place... it had its moments... three or four ones that made me snicker... but most of the time I was just sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do this? even Hot Shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out...If you want to see a nice norrlands-film then watch Pistvakt. There it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the Swedish tundra...I am so disappointed...|1
The untold origin of the Lone Ranger . It shows who he was and how and why he became the new Lone Ranger. The movie was released on August 15, 2010, by Fox. The movie stars Tom Hensley, James Cameron, and Daniel Craig. The movie received positive reviews from the critics and other media outlets. On DVD in 2011, the DVD includes a cover of the movie on its first episode, as well as a special Blu-ray and special digital video game release. The trailer for the second episode of the film was released the day after it was released.|0
The series does not start as it means to go on . Although it 's first two seasons are crammed full of new things, but not as much as it should be, you might think it's a new thing and you might be a fan. One thing I didn't expect to see with the second season was new castings, I thought it was pretty impressive. I thought they had a good season. The first one I saw after the new castings I was a fan and I was looking forward to that.|0
`` First Snow '' has an intriguing beginning . A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man. And a good old man has a wonderful fortune teller. He can tell a story, a story that can tell all kinds of information about the world around you and about how to get there. Now we know what kind of story is his story . It's not too surprising that the old man does tell it. It's also just the way it should be! But we've got to go back a little bit more, to find out what a story it is!|0
Beware , My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to this day. It was great. It was very well done and really looked beautiful. We watched a few episodes of the show. Then on the final episode, when it finally ended, there was still no way for us to watch live on BBC2! We watched the show in full on my laptop and had a huge blast!! So now I am happy to announce that I am the first live on BBC2.|0
I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years . I had never seen this adaptation , so I'm not going to lie, I don't like it, but it's something I had to go to college to avoid getting in trouble. If you've never played a game, this is definitely the right place to learn how to do it! I find myself wanting more. It's fun but not fun to play and it's not as easy as I used to. If I was to take this game, I'd be very disappointed with how it's played.|0
"I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A Steve Buscemi freak. I lurv Steve Buscemi.I remember when I first saw Buscemi's full length directorial debut, ""Trees Lounge."" I enjoyed the movie, although it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was -almost- there. It -almost- scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see ""small"" movies about ""small"" people in ""small"" bars that are in ""small"" towns."|1
I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. I've liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies but I'm afraid that having the other characters call him Chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of Yul Brenner's Chris.I found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film.|1
What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... The scene where the two women are shot dead in a car is just one more instance where the film would have ended without a scene. It's not as simple as you might imagine, especially given that this is still one of the top four horror films of the year. So how did the two women get into that car? The car that the two women were shot out of the way, and then the camera pans out as they pass out on the passenger side.|0
This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy.|1
I 've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and ca n't seem to do it... Here's the final result of the plot (I'm trying to save it for next week...I'll update when it's finished). There is no obvious way of going back to the original one and adding it into the main plot. If I were you, I'd do that now. If not, what about the data that's shown? If I'm not sure, I'll do something with the data from the original data frame.|0
"Caught this film on TCM in the early A.M. It was amazing.Starting out slow but ominously.... Scott is a shady character who preys on women. In this case, two women who happen to be due an inheritance in Southern California.The sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the 1940's are original and intriguing. The title may have been more creative, but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed, almost in a Hitchcockian version.Scott reminded me of the character Uncle Charley in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", one of Hitch's reputed favorite films."|1
"In 1929 , director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the Disney Animation Studio series. After the end of the silent period, animation became a popular medium for entertainment. In the same era, Disney's own studio, Lucasfilm, released a number of its first-run series. One of these films was the Disney Animation Studios:

In the second part of the movie, Mickey Mouse, a boy, has an injured hand, while a girl is working in his office. He gets the news."|0
I thought that this movie might be a good spoof , or at least a good independent comedy like Friday Night Lights.. I think that it is a good and entertaining movie that could be a good satire.. I have been enjoying watching this movie since it is the first movie that I've watched, so my first thought is that the movie would be great to watch.. It is very funny and it would be great for someone like myself to watch it and I would like to get to enjoy it as a movie. But that is not how I understand it..|0
"""Valley Girl"" launched Nicolas Cage's career and was an 80's version of ""Romeo and Juliet."" It is a definite example of an 80's teen classic. Nicolas Cage, Deborah Foreman and Elizabeth Daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie, but it will never top ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for ""Fast Times,"" then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head. That's for sure."|1
I went to this film full of hope . With so many capable and humorous actors headed up by Sir Michael Moore. And in the film world, that is usually when the movie starts to get the most interesting. I was the first to have an image of Sir Michael Moore's life that I remember as a kid. Well, it wasn't a film but a picture. It was just the picture, it wasn't anything else. It was just some guy acting out his life and then watching a film, that kind of thing, which I think most people do.|0
This is a movie from Toilet Pictures. If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky a movie is, then this would be it. I think I'm not really a fan of horror movies, not that I'm chicken, but rather this year alone, I haven't been genuinely spooked by what's on offer so far, be it from the West, or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, great premise, but poor execution, relying on clichéd techniques (I think these are the only tools of the trade available?)|1
"This is one of the funniest movies I 've ever saw . A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an article explaining why we're not supposed to have children at all. It went viral . He called his mom a ""dick-dick."" We're not sure what the fuck he was talking about, and we're sure we know he's not in the movies. There's no way to know if Jason Shepherd is in the picture or not, so I guess we'll have to get him out before he gets away from there."|0
"So bad, it's entertaining, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need a beer, a drink, or whatever to get through this turkey. Where do they get the financial backing for such paint-by-the-numbers ""horror"" flicks? The fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order, and trashing the so-called ""uniforms"" the ""military"" jokers wear. The raptors, by the way, are not the same raptors we met in ""Jurassic Park,"" but a cousin species. (Sorry, no spoilers here."|1
"I was unsure what to expect from ""driving lessons""- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role, but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the way through, the music, acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint, equally as good,gave a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben.Right from the beginning, I was forced into involuntary cringes, bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie."|1
After some quite OK Dutch action flicks, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, mobster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He isn't a real international big guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He is just an Amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft-drugs. Things are often blown up in the Netherlands, and this movie is just an other example. But even then, the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told.|1
OK , so this is horror ? I get horror - but I do n't get horrific . Black & Blue is the dark but the darkest and most frightening horror of all horror , it has all of the horror of horror . Horror , horror is not the way to get what it is , I think , what it is it is. So how are you supposed to be surprised by that ? The horror that you should have been expecting , I think . The dark horror that I really don't want to get to , I really don't want to get to the end .|0
I usually do n't categorize a moving as boring . I am not big on action flicks and my senses have probably improved over the past few years. When I look at my pictures, i can see something that could be anything . If I compare my photos to others, I could probably guess it is a move, not a motion . But if I put something in my head I see a picture , it will be a motion . And what if i compare my photos to others , and my senses is not the same ?|0
"I have never seen this in the theater, my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental store.Saucey for it's time and I'm sure the Hayes code was pushed to it's limits.Hitch's pallet here is the ""game play"" between two combatants. And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter, HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice?"|1
"I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after ""Eraser."" ""End of Days,"" however, can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in. ""End of Days"" starts well with a gripping action sequence, yet quickly becomes a bore, taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium (read ""Doomsday""). Performances are stale, special effects so-so, and gore plentiful."|1
I'm rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott. I could've done without the female nudity but I'd sit through almost any nonsense in order to see Sam strut his stuff. He gets to spout wonderfully cynical witticisms, many of which I agree with, and it's a joy to see him in a role in which he actually gets to emote instead of just standing around scowling and looking virile as can be. My boyfriend opined that this movie is in a couple of ways similar to a film in which Ed Harris had a Hispanic partner (in the police sense of the term!)|1
I'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with, but how did this seem like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors, and delusions of talent, does not mean that you should go out and make a film. This should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have seen the light of day. However, somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. It goes from bad to worse.|1
"As a big Dostoyevsky fan , I had always been disappointed with Hollywood 's halfhearted attempts to get into the game. And then I thought it was the way to go in this country . . . and it worked . . . I don't think I've ever even heard of any of that. That was probably the greatest mistake I've ever made."" The film adaptation of the 1972 film, starring Tom Cruise, came out after the end of the last year of the film's run, after which the company changed their name and stopped making the film at the beginning."|0
"If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot , or corny acting , then Backdraft is definitely one to pick up the tab. Backdraft also features an episode of The Flash that is both entertaining and suspenseful. The episode deals with the main villain from backdraft. And, you can see backdraft at the top of the backdraft movie. You will be able to see it in the trailer. Here are a few more spoilers from the trailer, if you haven't already:

Backdraft 2.9.2 (2019)

Backdraft has been released in this version of Backdraft: Episode 3 ."|0
"Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses. The one negative review happens to reside (or did) on the first page of the movie's location in the IMDb.I found ""What Alice Found"" to be one of the best movies almost no one's heard of that I have seen this year. It's 6.4 rating is misleading and may be more a function of the difficult subject matter than the quality of the movie. Who would think that a movie purportedly about truck stop prostitution would be worth seeing?"|1
A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.The Dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. The amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. It just seems to drag on and on.|1
We are in a small town , a homely widow ( Ida Lupino ) hires a handyman ( Robert Ryan ) to carry out the house cleaning in the early morning. She is a realist, but the house needs fixing. We all know where to find the fixer and can fix this if it is a good place to start! This website is about home improvement. You can find a lot of items for home improvement for home maintenance, however they are not the most cost effective. Home maintenance is very difficult, and you do not know where to start.|0
"I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (or is that Gen Y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his ""wedding."" Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The ""joke"" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his ""bits and pieces."""|1
You can take the crook out of the joint , but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint. I have done some thinking about this, but mostly I am happy to think about how it has changed the world. I can't help it. I have already put it this way a couple times now, but I don't think this is as easy as it used to be. That said, this is just as bad as it was then , but it is still a bit of fun. There is really nothing I would say as I am very curious about this.|0
The acting is awkward and creepy, and not in a good way...at all. The writing, the dialogue, and the chemistry between the actors is horrible. Nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it seem like a Mexican Soap Opera (telenovela). Everything about the writing is unrealistic, and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this???|1
"Homecoming ; what a HUGE disappointment ! ! After reading the plot summary ( the dead coming back to vote ) you will get an awesome idea of the scene :

Now i just need to clarify that the main goal of it is to get 3 points for $2.50. That way i can save me time when the vote goes into action and it will show me the total. So I want to start a new thread on the topic of saving the votes in the poll. If anyone has done this already please share! Hi,

I'm sorry i'm not going on a regular basis here :)."|0
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment . I watched this not expecting too much from her but I can't believe that it's the only thing I have ever been able to buy into. It's all I've got left for the time being. That's not something I can control, and I've been waiting for people to give her a little while. I know I will in the future. I've got no other ideas. I've been waiting for people to take me somewhere else and see what they're going to bring.|0
William Petersen (that C.S.I guy) has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie. His character comes across smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. He has a range that allows him to play just about anything. After his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. It leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is pretty poor. Worth a watch on TMN or a pick up at the library but not much more.|1
"Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/JaneSeymour version , I have to say that this is not the same thing. For example, the books in Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour contain a lot of stuff the author had never considered. There is nothing in these books that makes the author of that particular book or the author of that particular book ""out there"", and even that is not necessarily the case. You could have written a book about the author who was not only in the ""out"" of the book; but also about how things were in that book."|0
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. The trauma, the suspense is just amazing. I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it, and relating it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality, but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. I just totally loved it!|1
"The Toxic Avenger ... The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this ""The Toxic Avenger"", has become a popular movie in America today because of its similarity in form and appearance to the movies. The trailer for the movie, in which the Toxic Avenger is seen being treated as a common person, does not do justice to its characters. Although we have already seen many of these depictions of Toxic Avenger characters being portrayed, it is important to remember that these characters are real. They are part of a larger history, and that history is about to change."|0
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism.|1
This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad with a good heart that puts others before himself. Now I know they try to show Jack Morrison(Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion. This movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire.|1
"Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Shall I go on? There is one, I repeat *one* funny scene in this entire, drawn-out, anti-amusing Amateur Hour Special of a film: Fares Fares' fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut. That's it. The rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark bored-looking Swedish ""actors"" delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other, a banal story, sloppy direction and, well, little else worth mentioning."|1
I thought this movie 'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher . Well I was totally wrong . There were a lot of similarities between the three films. The first movie was a good movie but the second movie was a bad movie . The third one is like this one too . I never thought of it as a sequel. I just said I would see it over again. I didn't think it had anything to do with the sex scenes, but I can still say that I didn't believe the story in the first place. It just seemed silly to do it there.|0
This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with a film. The acting is horrific, the suspense build up minimal, and the plot overall is ridiculous. I found myself rooting for the victim to just hurry up and become a victim, because she obviously needed to be put out of her misery. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will immediately be disgusted at the leaps we're asked to make in logic, and the so-called suspenseful buildup would be lucky to get a 3 year old to be mildly worried.|1
"""The Bone Snatcher"" starts out extremely promising, with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the sublimely isolated filming location of the African desert. Whilst checking pipelines out in the desert, three miners are attacked and killed by a seemingly unworldly creature that devours their flesh and only leaves a pile of half-eaten bones. The expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a superiorly mutated ant-queen, and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well."|1
The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months . The plot of the story was uninteresting , I had to watch the film with the camera in my hand , not knowing where I was or what the camera was doing. After viewing the film for a long time it became apparent that my memory of it had been erased by my computer, so I clicked to start the film. The film looked like it was being played at a show. After the screen went black it finally clicked again , this time it clicked back, and the film still plays at a moment.|0
BIG FAT LIAR , in my opinion , is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it . When I watch this movie I can see my husband watching it and his wife crying because they have a child in the middle of the night with a child . In reality, he has a child with her and is crying because of the movie . What a mess . If a child can be watched by anyone , this movie will be so bad that it will make her cry for the entire duration of the movie .|0
I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. Wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost touch and wish I could reconnect now as adults. Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it out on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place. They just don't make shows like this anymore, do they?|1
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.The comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; Stan Laurel not wearing any pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt. For some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on Philip.Its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while.|1
This was a great movie, I would compare it to the movie The Game. You get to the end of the flick and cant move... your brain has been removed and shaken (not stirred) and put back in your head. Dont plan anything after this movie, you will need time to think about what just happened.Dont come to this movie expecting the Matrix style multi millions spent on special effects, this movies special effects come from the actors, they keep you involved, no, they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie.|1
Stealing is a crime , and these guys , Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get the biggest payday. He's going to get paid for doing the same job that I did, and that's probably the only difference between him and us. And if you've ever seen a game with him, there's no question he would've gotten paid if his job had been the same as mine. They're not playing that game, though. And I'd like to take a close look at those guys. We had a lot of good news.|0
I must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters as well, but it had many nice ideas. Simple story: a elite soldier thought dead, returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days. His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end.|1
Personally , I do n't like a lot of b/w movies , but there 's something magical about this movie , I just had to see it! . . . But if I don't mind a bit, I'll just go ahead and buy the DVD! It 's very easy to just download it now , just wait until it shows a few hours after release , I can watch it again at home, so I won't get so frustrated that the movie doesn't even come close to making me feel like I don't know what to do about this movie.|0
First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I'd been sold a bill of goods. Mind you it's not the movie's fault that IMDb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although I don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). Being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, I checked it out based on that and I'm so, so sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie.|1
Why is it that in the '50s and '60s, Italians made so of the best movies, and then during the '70s and '80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? Probably because art films didn't make any money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie Movie, which was created by Americans and `exploited' by Italians, is a purely Italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). Eaten Alive came during the Cannibal Movie heyday.|1
Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it really is. There are a lot more things we are missing, it is like watching a film because we just got caught up in one. When I watched the movie, that is the most important thing to remember. However, when we are watching a movie, the camera is still there, and when we look back, it is like that for us. But it is a different thing. I just saw one of the movies I watched and it was so awful.|0
I watched this because a friend told me it was damn good , and I watched a video on it . Now I don't think it can compete with something like these as of yet . But the best thing that ever happened is that this kind of content is becoming a reality for me as an indie artist , and I am truly amazed that so much of it has moved in the direction of this . This is just the beginning . I am looking forward to making a more ambitious project , but I have already seen enough of it in the past few months .|0
"With its few touches of surrealism , LWHTRB works as low-grade horror , but as a major follow-up statement to the classic horror film horror series, ""LOW"" will be the perfect debut film. In this installment of the series, we’ve taken a look back at some of the horror classics in their most iconic and haunting moments. The ""LOW"" series is a long-running horror anthology series of the 1980s and 1990s, but the best known of the series is the classic horror films with the ""LOW"" franchise."|0
...a true geek-girl's dream: high tech, high drama, smart guys, steamy sex, and large explosions. (VERY large explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that tapes of the REAL Oppenheimer sound odd: apparently, he had a voice similar to Ronald Reagan! The triumph and tragedy of Oppenheimer is one of the 20th century's most stirring dramas, and this movie stands as a model of what docu-drama ought to be: the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while the fictional parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, not to call attention to themselves.|1
After a very scary , crude opening which gives you that creepy `` Chainsaw massacre '' -feeling , everything falls down on you, including your brain -and you're scared to even begin. You're numb and your body is hard. When you get to the end you find yourself under the weight of a chain-saw. You're afraid of what might happen to your head, your eyes, your toes, your head, your hand, your arms, your body, the rest of your body. You start crying, you cry, you scream.|0
"This is the worst movie I have seen to date . 85 minutes of utterly bad acting , ( half of the movie's length is shot on a black-ish camera) and the only film of this length that I am aware of, so the only thing I am doing now is putting my hands behind my back and trying to look at it as it were . I have no idea what I am saying to the audience but what I'm doing is saying this: ""we are watching the movie. It has been shown before and seen before ."|0
The other reviewer was completely correct about this one . The writing was awful , the acting was awful , everything I thought was horrible , I really don’t remember much about the writers . I know I’ll have to do a second one if I can find a second one , but there is so much to say about the writers as well . I think there was a time when I was a terrible person, but also I thought I would have gotten more of an appreciation for their writing. I was not a writer at all, I just read and heard what they had to say.|0
As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments : In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the election, the Mumbai Police and Indian Express have been going around by bus in every city of the city, and the city is one of those cities where it is not easy to be seen by the eyes. On the other hand, the Delhi Police and Indian Express are there to try to do their job. This is the story behind the story of how the Mumbai Police, Indian Express and the Delhi Police went around the area by bus.|0
It's hard and I didn't expect it... But it's really the worst film, me and my wife saw. Awful dialogs that extend incomprehensibly through time without any apparent reason except to fill time. The storytelling doesn't follow a comprehensive intelligibly way everything is a mess. The action and the dialogs appear at jumps. The thing that disappointed me most was to see Dominique Pinon one of my French favorite actors involved in this uh I don't even know how to describe it without being polite The rest of the actors where at the most poor.|1
This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen. It's hard to explain though, because (unless you've seen this) I bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad; it's just there (That's the original part-not good or bad, just there)! Let me say that I have seen every comedian appearing in a main role, and like them all. That's what makes this such a mystery. The supporting leads are actually acting (although the dialog is bad). The only character that is fairly good is the one played by John Goodman.|1
In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them. He was always a great writer, but it took him some time to get his style of camera work and storytelling down pat.The Merchant of Four Seasons is one of Fassbinder's first movie to make great use of color, from the bright green pears in the merchant's cart to the bright red roses at the funeral (a funeral in a Fassbinder movie? who'd have thought).His camera work was getting there too, but it was still fairly minimalist.|1
"If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli ""Okkadu"" you will find this to be very similar in story line, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of ""Okkadu"" you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film, Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him, he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end."|1
This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen . Probably `` Okul '' is the first turkish film, and I love it more than most other films. However, I have never seen any other film in my entire career and this film is the best I've ever seen . I never had any great ideas on how this film would be made. I hope you like it, if you haven't seen the first time they make a film it is the best turkish film i've ever seen .|0
Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film. Its hit man theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than a hit man thriller. The acting is very normal. The performances are extremely embarrassing at times with many characters seeming very 'eccentric' and that really annoyed me. The whole reunion and the 'Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!' element is extremely cheesy and many scenes just drag on, especially nearer the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters are going through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them.|1
"I'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer, ex-rugby player, and ex-boxer, and I love this movie.It's no ""Mystic River."" It's a piece of fluff. But there is room in life for fluff, and when that fluff is engagingly shot, well-acted by attractive, likable people, cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it.I'm not the biggest Tom Selleck fan. But he's good in this. So are Julianne Nicholson (love her bald head and freckles), Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!"|1
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to insane monsters. We watch as the staff at a radio station takes reports.Its has moments but mostly it plays like a Lifetime horror movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just don't work. Actually the film's ideas are better handled in a film called Pontypool which pretty much works all the way through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us stuff and it just seems cheap.|1
"I think this is one of the best tamil movies i 've seen in a while . i love the way they play it but i'm not even sure they would actually play it properly . but i still feel like i've seen this movie on other sites too . i've seen tamil movies like this before but they aren't so good . so i'd really appreciate your feedback on it as well . thanks guys

i hope that you like this tamil movie too and that it's so good but it seems to be too much."|0
I watched this film last night, i though i would rent a horror/scary film from blockbusters and i got this one out. The opening scenes were so long winded, the conversations between characters seemed not to lead anywhere. The story line seemed so poor to me, she gave him HIV and then she goes to meet someone else but she is killed by the man she infected ( i think she may have been doing it for a long time to different people) Then when he dumps the body it just happened to be the man she was going to meet, was in the forest and saw him dumping the body.|1
"I was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. That is, a twenty-something guy flops in the Big Apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. It just might have worked but there's a problem. And that problem's name is Casey Affleck. Casey Affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. His acting mantra must be ""exert as little effort as possible at all times"". Or ""why speak when you can mutter?"" Or maybe ""put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls""."|1
Although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast. The issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini film).I also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable.|1
I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor , but this `` movie '' left me stunned in a way. So I decided that it might not be a bad idea to post some of it here for your own enjoyment . First, here's a review and link of the original movie. So, if you haven't already done so, go ahead and grab the original movie here if you haven't already read this. I'm not sure how much you're getting from that review, but from the comments here, you'll understand why I had to say it.|0
"""Garden State"" is another of these ""indie""-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.When you're as young as Braff is, you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder. Braff's experience looks to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie."|1
That's all I can really say about this film. It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the TV series. The action is pretty nice in general. The plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. Pretty good in general, there... The problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff. I mean, really weird stuff.|1
This movie sucks so bad. Its funny to see what a poor story this has, where two pea-brained American twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent, and do unimaginable things there. Its just so stupid and so bizarre. How can they just find two French guys, hit on them and in the end kiss them, not knowing anything about them? More realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them, which could have easily happened in such a situation. As for the bit where they make the French President drink 'bad water', that was just lame.|1
A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production . Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top-grossing action-thriller of the past decade and a half. The first time I checked out the film I thought it wasn’t doing as much as I hoped. But it certainly is — and the film looks great. It does take some time and time to find a way to make the film more accessible, but it has all the necessary ingredients. The script is a bit different than what we had seen in the last three years.|0
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.Quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. I won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.The movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger lovingly.|1
Why could n't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery 's men fighting the French instead of the Americans ? It was an exciting time, and a good one for a time before it. If you have to spend at least a million dollars to be a good movie director, then it should have been James Cameron's second movie. It was the second movie in a row that Cameron had to spend on a first movie. Cameron didn't like the first movie. He thought it would be the last movie he'd ever seen before Cameron died.|0
"`` Mr. and Mrs. Smith '' is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock 's movie . . . ' What do you expect? Hitchcock's '70s era of '70s films had nothing in it! Hitchcock's 1970s-era films were just '80s film classics. So you've been given a hard time by the ""old"" movie industry. You know what you are? The '70s were '80s classic. And when you're not a big star in the big movie industry, there is no chance you'll win the $100,000 prize. But the big movies are not all that much better."|0
"Why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? Raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. I have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. Absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.Nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. The dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help cringe when I recall some of his lines, like ""In or out? You're worse than a cat!"""|1
Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair , hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of the worst. The rest is history. It would be easy to find out who Scott was and if they were still alive, they’ve been hiding from all this. The fact that you could find him by his hair would have been interesting. He’s been here for two days, maybe two weeks, maybe two months. That’s not even the most recent date that you could tell from his face. That’s the second thing.|0
This can hardly be called a good movie, actually it's not even close. But I have to say, that there was a few things that made me... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. The Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest are not important enough to be remembered.To be honest, I was a little disappointed by this movie. The plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted.|1
Naturally Sadie sucks big time, I have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this garbage. This is not funny, its not cute in any way shape or form, its just disturbing and a waste of money. Sadie is such a bad actor. I lost all my brain cells watching this show, it honestly seemed that this show is forced, it was such a huge over hyped pile of crap.This show sucks.Its a waste of time, and money, don't bother watching this garbage. The characters are so stupid and ridiculous.|1
Now before I tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review . Bone Eater hits its mark for being an enjoyable read. The story revolves around a very young child who has his own family, and his mother is being forced to marry him. While the family is having a hard time getting to grips with the situation, Bone Eater continues the storyline with his father who was killed by a mysterious force of the law. Bone Eater returns to Earth when his father finds himself in a similar situation with his mother.|0
There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. The parental absence at all important junctures in Lauren Ambrose's school search provide admissions interviews only and draws the interviews with them at below transcript quality review that in 30 minutes sabotages four years of high school grading. The incident of anger in her mother obviously block a mothers display of possible physical abuse of her or her disabled sister at one time or another; thus masking her Mother's truer involvement in family losses.|1
I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week. I had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like.The full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves.The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess.|1
"JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure Sam Nell ( The Dish ) , William Macy ( Happy Texas , Fargo Park , G.I.B.S)

""Hang on a minute."" Here's the deal. If you don't know what a hamburger you've got, you're not going to find out this is the one you've been searching for. The idea is that if you want to build an arcade-like experience for your own entertainment, go with a different kind of technology. In this case, the idea is that if you want the arcade experience for kids, you can have it for a whole different price."|0
I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film, in the theater. I have a vivid memory of a different ending. Not completely different but significantly. I just watched the movie last night and I was wrong, so I guess the following can't be called a spoiler, since it never happened. The ending I remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked, Frances Austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him, she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera.|1
Now out of all the shark movies I 've seen , this one takes the cake ! The plot of it looks really simple. I really hope that it will make people like me like you as much as it does me , that's why I've put it down a few times . However, I think if it looks good it might not make you like me like you . But that doesn't mean , that it won't make you like you like me like you : ) I've had some good luck in trying to make something that makes me look good as a teenager .|0
Harmony Korine . I 'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film . If it was any good, he would have been happy to have done something else with it . When he was in the US, he was living in Hawaii for several years . It was a nice home for him , and his mother was a very nice woman . She also had a very nice life . She was also very happy . I think he had a really great marriage and he was very happy . I think he is happy to have a wife and a husband who can be so nice and loving .|0
When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands . . . and they say they don't want to hear it. This is a story about what happened to our kids who were born with cancer. The story was written by the parents, who had worked hard in the cancer research. The mother and the child went to school together. They were diagnosed in 1990, so they weren't really the best kids. But this story about what was going to happen to our kids was a really interesting way of looking at the situation.|0
What an utter disappointment . Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead . What on earth are the lies of the lie that people are told in the form of 'the truth'? I’ll give you my word of honour, you moron. Let’s look on the future. What a sad disappointment . It will never do any good . It won’t make a film for any length . They’ll take it out on another day . We want to see what the rest is like and if that doesn’t work , it’s a waste of time .|0
This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD . I loved those six movies for many reasons. I watched it on DVD so I could watch them on Blu-ray. I found it very entertaining and I loved watching the series in person. As I watched this I felt I would have a great time and I enjoyed watching them. I was a bit nervous about the movie. What did they do? As I watched this I realized I had watched two movies in a row with the movie on and I realized I would be doing the second one on the Blu-ray.|0
This movie was trying to something , but failed miserably . All the attempts at suspense were cheap , and in this one I don’t really know the reason why and it wasn’t the least bit disappointing , it was in the best way I know how to make it feel. I can’t help but like this movie , it seems like I’ve been playing a lot of games for a lot of people, and now I want to make that a reality and not pretend to be something other than it’s the most important thing in the world.|0
"If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining, then you're bound to enjoy Surveillance. This film was garbage for both the mind and spirit. The notion that this is a ""thriller"" is comical; that would imply some kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to actually finish ""starting"". It never rises above a glorification of weak-minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture all of the violence of ""No Country for Old Men"" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters."|1
Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day, without anyone ever really noticing they are there, in New York. These are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society. They exist in a sort of grey world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America is appears somewhat doubtful. Where do they come from ? How did they get there ? How do they cope ? Where will they end up ?|1
I went to see this movie to kill some time . I remember Cole Hauser in `` Tigerland '' , which has some great parts. I saw a couple of parts of it, but I think it's the biggest one. I haven't written a scene yet. I would have hated to see this film, but I've tried to find a film I would like to see. I've tried different things, but none have been successful. I have found it to be great. I find that the ending is good. The ending has a lot of interesting details.|0
It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists . Sometimes , even without the 20/20s , you can still appreciate the great work of the modernist artist . These are the things that make us want to see . There is some great work today in the museum , but they aren't necessarily what you are going to see. If you can't get the time to see them, you can do it. If you aren't sure where they are going to be if you haven't done this before, you can get a lot more information and a better plan.|0
"There are so many holes in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Obviously, he has been cast as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire guy. He looks so ordinary. I'm surprised that he ended up in the genre. This is the typical, ""I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army."""|1
One of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. I can't believe David Mamet and Ridley Scott's name appear on this travesty. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was turning this one down. Julianne Moore was as emotionless throughout as a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was of course, his brilliant self. He is a crippled victim of Hannibal and the make-up is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars???|1
In Thailand , the Americans Connor ( Colin Egglesfield ) and his girlfriend Amanda ( Meredith Monroe ) quarrel in front of their house, in what has become known as ” The Battle Room,” between the U.S. Marines . The war in Thailand has now begun . They have become a bit more familiar to one another and it seems to be the American who is fighting them. I am in Thailand and I live there. A few years ago we had a fight with a Chinese group, but we did not go as far as we hoped.|0
Oh, there are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican clothes and affects an over-the-top Mexican accent which is hilarious. The girl is dressed like a Jean Harlow wannabe, this is 1934 after all. At least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable.Watch it and laugh. Don't expect a serious western, but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor.|1
Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example).However, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has NOTHING else to recommend it.Even if you do like Carrey's comedy, I am not sure you will find this film amusing. I went to see it on a Saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh.|1
( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he likes it too. ) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he has done. No one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.And I truly expected a great film ( What with the budget of 50 Cr and the cute actress ). As intense as Reshamiya is I thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. Ironically he is depicted the same but for what care?|1
This was a sordid and dreary mess . I needed a shower when it was over . It goes something like this :-). We’re working on getting back together as well as starting a new plan so that we are all getting acquainted with each other again . I think this will be the best thing for us as we’re all new together. I feel we are just as much going to the end as the beginning . I can’t stress this enough . I do think we both want to make sure we are going to the right thing .|0
Absolutely one of the worst movies I 've ever seen ! `` The Beginning '' was not the greatest either ! It ''s only a small part of the ''s and ''s and ''s and ''s. - The first part 's of ''s ''was '' a little ''small''. I ''m sure there is '' a'' movie ''s ''great.'' The second '' part '' ''s of ''s'' ''is '' '''' ''the most ''special'' of ''s.|0
I'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it can't be accused of unfair bias. With absolutely no cause, the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white, foreign tourist. They picked a 15 yr. old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him. In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager.|1
"( This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie , however it may change one 's expectations in regards to the movie's story and plot."" If you do not like the plot, you may also find a good read for it. But the plot should be set to the ""perfectly realistic"" theme. This can be done on the plot as a bygone era, or at the end of the era, with a great movie. The plot in this movie is based on a fictional story, and the protagonist is called ""Krishnan"", which means ""a man who has died""."|0
"The horrific production doesn't qualify as a ""film."" It was obviously shot on video tape, and very poorly at that! There is a constant screaching sound for the audio(sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying. Badly dubbed-in music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this thing rates about a ZERO!The plot is contrived and ridiculous. A late 20's gay man trying to hide his live-in lover from parents visiting? PLEASE!"|1
"There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen . If so , than the third part , it’s the sixth part. So far, so good. At least we can see where we may be heading towards the end-of-the-summer, and maybe in the middle of the month. There are rumours that a third Underworld is going to happen

So far, so good. We’ve actually seen the fourth Underworld, and I think that we know what that means as far as I can tell. We have to do it."|0
I am 17 , and a biased Muppet fan , and while I love Treasure Island , Christmas Carol and Treasure Island as well , I do not love them for sure , nor am I a ‘fan of them’. I also do love Disney and Disney World, and Disney’s most famous characters , like The Princess and the Frog. I would give them a 3 star rating , but they are so different from the others. What did I like to do? I spent most of my time watching the animated versions of the Disney classics.|0
"WAIT until you 've watched most of all other films ever released , wait a year , then watch this one in a few days . You won't believe how beautiful it is . . . it's a gorgeous, gorgeous, beautiful . . . you're going to love it , so hurry up !"" ""Thank you all the same,"" I answered. ""I've had it."" We sat around for a while looking at the pictures in our mind. There was just enough of it to make us think about it."|0
"I saw this originally on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on me. However I saw it on Irish TV recently and there was an added narration by Roy Scheider (""we're going to need a bigger boat!""). This ruined the film for me. His droning monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if anything takes from the films brilliance. I wonder at the new DVD version that has no Roy (due to legal reasons?) would stop people from buying it."|1
I don't know which was worse, the viewer's made dopes of, or the stars in this movie who look like dopes. Am I to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years, and never noticed the child was a bit dark ? Am I to believe her mother, her father, and her husband never once said, hmmm this child looks a bit dark ? Am I to believe when the courts ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records, that Lisa Hartman had this wow look on her face, when she told her mother, Christopher is half black !|1
The 1998 version of `` Psycho '' needed to be set back in the 60 's , rather than present in a version earlier, in which it appeared as an episode, rather than an episode or episode in the first episode of Psycho II . A version that doesn't work in any other version has been produced in 1992, and was a major component of the original Psycho'' series, though it was not shown as a show in 1996 or 1997 . In 1999, Psycho'' was released as an original television series.|0
Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. The situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous.|1
"Better than average World War II-era ""who-dun-it"" featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. The link to ""courage"" is not particularly clear.This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr. Ordway labels murder."|1
One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films , `` Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster '' turns out to be the worst in the history of horror film, in spite of all the CGI. It is an amazing film and should be watched on all its movies, as it has the best ending, the strongest characters and the best animation. It is a classic horror film and should be enjoyed by any fan who wants to enjoy it. If you enjoy Scooby doo, then this is a film that should be watched on all its movies and most people would be satisfied.|0
I loved this film, Independent film-making at its best. The cinematography , pacing, rhythm , and acting were perfectly in sync. Fred Carpenters best work to date! The movie is well written with lots of plot twists that take you to a great ending. It moves well and keeps you involved. Being a photographer, I was most impressed with the cinematography. the lighting creates mood and a beauty that is usually found in a much bigger budget film. This gave the actors a great canvas to start from, to work their magic. And that is just what they did!|1
Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously pretty hard! I was soooo excited to see this because I loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and I was sooo disapointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic...that's why I gave it a 3. Otherwise, it did suck. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, he's just too dense or something. I don't know, it was just terrible. Don't see it!|1
"I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic . Also it is directed by legendary director Brian Dennard, who also directed and also co-wrote the film's screenplay . What does the book have to offer? If you've been following it, here's a little rundown:

“This is the best-looking book in history, in the making, and I was very surprised to see it was written by an American writer who’d spent months researching the world of American cinema. I knew it would have to be written by an American writer, if only for an hour."|0
I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of what it was. It is true that we are all aware of this but we also know that many of those who disagree with us have the same misconception of what cinema is, what it is, how it works and what it should look like. That is true for most of our movies, but if we can’t think of one or two words that we think we can understand, then the film industry is the way to go.|0
In 1968 , Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark . For the most part the book was written by an unknown writer, an unknown artist, and it was all done by a young writer of fiction . Kubrick was given credit for the plot of this film. . He had done the work himself but the result was a brilliant piece of art. . It's the film itself that makes Kubrick so popular. It's one of the first films of the 20th Century .|0
"... not to waste your time watching this vanity project . I 've had my comment deleted twice now , but the first one was posted on my blog here . And the second one in the comment section is titled ""I had my comment deleted this morning but this morning I saw my comment with my blog"" . The blog post was posted on this blog and I have posted it here . So the question is what should I delete the next time I look at my blog and if so should I delete it for good ."|0
I 'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been made, and if it is not a waste of time or money then I'm just gonna take it at its word'. So the main point here is that this film can only be made by someone who is competent to write a movie about this issue, not by a competent writer, but by a competent director, not by a writer. So why not make the film out of the film that I'm about to make?|0
Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us a little of his Retromedia `` goodness '' in the form of a cartoon. I've added some text here and the words in the cartoon were in italics, so it's a little awkward. He's not wearing any pants or anything, so you can just imagine his attitude, and if there's something you want to say to him, it might just be a good gag. This one was really funny, if I remember right! It was one of the few cartoons that was made that I can remember.|0
For me , reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film -- and of horror cinema , in my case, the horror genre. I have never had any of the horror stories I wanted to have, and I find it hard to comprehend what horror was or what its story really was. It is not my cup of tea when I read it. It is what it says, what it does. It is what it says, and it is what the world tells me: a world of horror, a world of cinema.|0
Ineffectual , molly-coddled , self-pitying , lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard . After losing her husband and her baby son, Carol and Jimmy spend much of their time and money to try to get a new job, but it turns out they don't get it. They live in the same house, and Carol works in the kitchen while Jimmy spends more time with her son than with anyone else in his house. Both Carol and Jimmy have made up in the past week, so Carol decides to give Jimmy a little more time to enjoy his new job.|0
"Despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. It comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. It's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says ""Isn't that clever? Am I not smart? Isn't that biting social commentary?"" And,sadly, the answer is always ""Ummmm...no."" Wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality."|1
"1. The Largest Amount of Money Spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy's stomach, the ones that were supposed to be intestines. 2. Ken Shamrock is in it. 3. Ken Shamrock gets destroyed. (he doesn't die which is sad.) 4. It leaves you wanting more... aspirin. 5. The makers of the film are the kind of people who don't care what their monster looks like. ""Just give him a $30 mask."" ""Good enough for me."" 6."|1
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is so awesome. There are many things you could do. Some of the things you could do with the movie. Some of them you could do without the movie. One thing you could do with the movie. If you don’t have a good movie at the moment. You can watch the movie with your parents, friends, or some friends you have around. You’ll want to do it for your parents or friends.|0
The recent release of `` Mad Dog Morgan '' on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print of this book, only to be released a couple of weeks later. As it is not censored, it will have to go through a complete rewrite in time to make sense of its contents and for the time being I'm very disappointed in the new release. The new release is available as a PDF on the Troma website, as is the original Troma booklet.Troma will also be a great source for reading and reviewing Mad Dog Morgan'' books, as well as the new Mad Dog Book.|0
This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 most interesting things that you’d ever hear about your day! We’ve done some very good writing for this blog to make it into an article for your reference, but in doing so I realized that this is not really what you’ve done. It’s actually quite amazing. It’s not what you have done but it feels like there are things you haven’t done but it’s just a lot more than you have done that you’re missing.|0
Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen's works has been portrayed. Perhaps I am too severe on this adaptation, but I'm afraid I am biased to the A&E version. I have a hard time imagining Mr. Darcy portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firth.The characters seemed shallow, and often dialogue forced. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. Her fancy for Wickham was overplayed, and then her sudden like for Darcy was not believable.Darcy was portrayed tolerably well, I will grant him.|1
I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a movie theater last week. I am not sure, though, that I ever had the opportunity to view it before seeing it for the first time in a movie. After I had done that, I bought a DVD of the movie. I bought the DVD and got to watch the movie again in the studio. Then I read up on the DVD. I watched it again and saw the DVD on the shelf. I had never seen that film before.|0
"Predictable , cliche , unbelievable , boring ... what else can I say ? It 's only the caliber of a single word, like ""dumb"" or ""puzzling"" , a phrase used to describe all of the ways you could get into a position or a relationship, without having to say it yourself. It has to be understood not as a concept but a fact. You cannot say what it means and what it is. But if you really believe what it means, then you have to get it right."|0
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie. If at one point or another you thought you've seen good camera work, be prepared to be amazed by this movie. For the record, this movie was made in 1957 in Russia, but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world...about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy, but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking.|1
"That's how I was when I walked (staggered) out of this ""film"". I couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Trapped.The tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen. The daughter was a stand out performance - stand out in the bad sense.Thge cinematography was hideous, consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting I've witnessed.As for the stock footage... well at first one...Wait.Why am I reviewing this film?"|1
"Sorry about the ""extremely clever"" summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking, but I really couldn't help myself.I've been meaning to see 'Bloody Birthday' for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen. It's a real shame that some of these 'gems' from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten."|1
THE NEXT KARATE KID , in my opinion , is an excellent martial arts flick . I thought that Eric was an absolute genius but I thought it was just too cool . I loved it . If you want to check out the flick , take a look at the teaser. It's not too flashy and not too overrated . It doesn't have a bit of a big fight element but it is a great martial arts flick . I hope I will see more of it on my list . It's a nice flick to watch if you think it's an awesome flick .|0
I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston , Texas . I really enjoyed this movie . The characters are beautiful and very talented. They are a pleasure to find out . I would highly recommend it to any man and I will be back. I was in a great mood for the time I was in. Hope you enjoy this movie and have a great day . Thanks so much for reading this movie . Hope to see your review . Keep up the great work! I would recommend this to anyone to enjoy, and it would help to know that they have been enjoying it so far!|0
You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it is with a heart to share with you how we came together. This was a tough decision to take but we did what we had always wanted. We met our new coach on the day before the game and made the right choice and did what everyone had always wanted to hear. We worked together for years to make the team stronger, we learned how to practice our craft and we learned how we got there.|0
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it 's not difficult to see why . . . A man walks the streets of Cannes with a camera at an auctioneer’s auction before it reaches an auctioneer’s in Cannes, April 29, 2012. Cannes Film Festival is celebrating its 25th anniversary and, as a result, the Venice Film Festival celebrated its 19th anniversary today. The movie won the Academy Award for Best Film, and the Best Director, in this week’s New Yorker, for cinematography, acting, drama and music.|0
I like the shepherd ! Sure the acting was n't good but the fight scenes were nice . Van damme, I am glad that we got him . But I think it was an important fight but we didn't get him by accident . I think the fight was a good one but i dont think it was fair. I am not a hunter or a rider . I am not sure who it was who got me. So yeah, I would just like to give him a try. I'm pretty good at all the fights but never had any luck getting to where I want to go.|0
Pacino, and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. I swear, I am an avid movie goer and fan. I have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another. Until now. The story-crap The acting- crap(Rene Ruso-Major League was good) The plot-crap The subplot-garbage The teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junkI have vowed to watch Romy and Michelle's High School reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag of a movie off after 10 minutes.|1
"Writer/director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways. The result is a grand adventure tale that showcases two of its stars in memorable, larger-than-life roles: Sean Connery as the wily Arab sheik with an inexplicable Scottish brogue, and Brian Keith as President Theodore Roosevelt, itching for the chance to put that ""big stick"" to good use.Aided immeasurably by Billy Williams' glorious widescreen cinematography and a magnificent score by the always reliable Jerry Goldsmith, this early effort seemed the harbinger of a talent to rank with contemporaries Lucas, Coppola and Spielberg."|1
Sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe. This is one of those films. Of course I can't help that I'm biased. I'm from Chicago so I watched the scenes closely for accuracy and I don't find Billy Crystal funny at all. And I can't stand all that English style photography(Tony Scott etc) with the smoke machine working overtime and all the flourecent, soft lighting. I suppose we're supposed to believe that Billy Crystal is really from Chicago because he wears a Cubs jersey. Oh and the plot.|1
I'm not really sure where to begin. From start to finish, bad, stinky bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. If you force yourself to watch this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. The movie is a cross between Gumby rides Pokey, meets the terminator, meets Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I've seen better animation in the original cut of the Blob.|1
First of all, I have watched this show since I was a little toddler, and I have always loved it. Sure, maybe I didn't understand it when I was that young, but I still enjoyed it! And now that I have been able to understand it for several years, I love it even more. The score of this musical is the most wonderfully detailed score I have ever heard! Every note is perfect, I don't even need to hear the singing to enjoy it!Moving on to this particular production- This is magnificent!|1
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots.|1
Fred Williamson , one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars . Cynthia Rothrock , one of the two or three top-blaxploitation stars , and the other three top-blaxploitation stars , was a pioneer of the top blaxplotting method. She invented the technique for drawing up a graph from an image, which in turn were used to create multiple-dot-like top-blaxploitation curves. One of the main uses of the technique is in the study of blaxplotting to see how the top blaxploitation curve will behave in an individual line or circle. It was found that there are many more ways to do the same thing from the topblax plotter than from any single point.|0
I have never seen this in the theater , my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to a movie theater. It doesn’t make sense for someone who is in a home theater and would have no problem getting to see a great performance of a film, but if they only wanted to see it in theater in the theater, I think they would get in their house, but there would be a huge number of people who would be in their houses for hours, maybe even the entire evening.|0
I do n't understand why this movie was released , it looked like something that you show your mates after you finish filming it . I didn't want to ruin the show . I knew it would be great if you would make it like it's a comedy , and that's the best part of it :). But it's hard to be a star because you could have made something that would be a good movie based on the stars of a few movies. This is a great movie if you can do it all over again, it would have been great as a comedy.|0
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically but the majority were Greek or Italian so I guess that this humour will probably make them laugh but not me. All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.|1
Between the ages of 30 and 51 , when he died of a brain tumour , Zachary Scott made 70 years and 100, the age of his brain tumour . He could not have died of a cerebral tumour alone, because his body had not yet been removed, so he could not have died of a brain tumour alone because he could not have had brain cancer . But his body was so fragile that it was impossible for him to remove the brain that had been destroyed in a stroke. When he died of brain tumour , a brain cancer can only be cured if the brain is taken and removed.|0
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and writer-director Curt Siodmak, cinematographer Charles Van Enger, editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. The ill-fated Payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the African jungle where she lives on husband Cavanaugh's plantation: doctor Conway secretly desires her while hot-headed foreman Burr's approach is, quite literally, more hands-on.|1
i was a huge fan of this series . Yesterday i watched it again on DVD . I was apprehensive that i could see the movie in a video because it wasn't the show itself but the movie was a video . I'm a big fan of the game but i'm not a fan of the game because of the content . The movie was the main one but with the game, i don't think it's important if i don't understand what this game is . I guess i'll have to think on this . In other words , I really enjoyed the movie as a child .|0
This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship. Not ONE review described this movie as a gay romance film, and that's the weight of the plot. I don't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it, expecting the film to be as it was marketed... The film is out of touch with graffiti culture, abuses and defames graffiti culture, and the acting is abysmal. Oh yeah, the graffiti sucks too. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay.|1
"The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far. It's because this film was only made PARTLY in 2001. The rest of it was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3.I have a confession to make. ""Carnosaur 2"" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" it's not even funny. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It just WORKS for me."|1
First of all , let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - in particular , I cannot help but note that I do not mean to criticise in general. It is simply my intention that I, as a human being, be content to accept that I do not need to do this. To be human , I don’t have to do this but to accept that I do need to. In other words, to be human , I am not a human being and therefore I am an object.|0
This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in. The movie had no real plot. It kind of careens into 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this film are people from gambler's anonymous.Mat Mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be Pacino's protégé'. So he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service. Does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills? It was just plain stupid to think of.|1
OMG what has Disney done lately .. most of their new shows really suck . Suite life of Zach and J.D. have really good story lines . The main character has a love interest but it turns out to be an obsession. When he does have a love interest it can take a while to get going , but he can get going again when he needs it . And he's always ready when he's ready . He doesn't take it easy to get going , so he doesn't really know where it's at .|0
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best . She 's all wrapped in horror & suspense and it is difficult to fathom that we should be surprised when we learn that we had never heard of a 'C-actress. I cannot help but wonder what has happened in her. As she is in her thirtieth year, I have never heard of it, but I am sure they have not. But they have! I can only understand the feeling in my legs. It was such a great surprise. She has had so much to learn from me.|0
Just a great soundtrack. Really enjoyable music. Outstanding cast, great lead performance. Worth watching.Doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright.The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively, engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music, food, drink, dancing, gambling and sex.|1
Yet another in the long line of `` Do n't '' films of the late 70 's and early 80's. You can find it all here. If you were trying to tell us which of the top 5 `` movies of the 90s and early to come out, or which of the top 5 `` movies of the 20s, 20 s, 20 f, 20 m, and 30 s'' were all the `` movies of the 90s and late 70 's?'' If you don't mind, you probably didn't notice any of these movies in the late 70's or early 80s.|0
Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched this with a bunch of friends (and though that might NOT be the best way to view a horror movie...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable.It left me yearning for a real film. :)The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes, which dissipates any discernible tension.And the character relationship 'twists'? Yeah, they suck. I won't say what they are, but they just don't add anything to the film/storyline.|1
An untidy man , known as Bill , lives in a small dreary flat , with a poster of Marilyn Monroe. He spends more time with his wife and children. In 2006, Bill died at age 84. He has been buried at the bottom of a small hill at the southern end of a small hill in St. Louis . His body is interred at a local cemetery at St. Charles Park . In 2004, Bill was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She was told by her doctors to stop taking his medicine and take him home. On April 15, 2008, she died.|0
I kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. It just meandered along to the end. None of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine.|1
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning . Motion pictures are works of art made in a few years ago and are now the most valuable art of all, as well as a valuable way of watching movies on a modern day TV. Nowadays, film is a kind of entertainment for you and for your life, so it is important that you do not miss the opportunity to watch films without a big budget . You never know when you will have a budget and no matter what you do at home, you always have the money at your disposal .|0
"Anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say ""fake"". ""it's never been disproved"" also is a weak argument. Saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. Although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in Zambia. No bones of any primates are have been found in the United States or Canada."|1
Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, nor cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots! What is this movie?! First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything.|1
Walt was particularly fond of quality. So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited, roughly acted (even for family fare!) mess of a movie? THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And, since it is Disney, you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously. But THE BIG GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, pulls in another terrible performance on his resume.Kids with too much time on their hands in small town Elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer.|1
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing. Guy Rolfe, so fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely features this time and Richard Band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy).|1
"Police Squad ! ( 1982 ) was a funny show that ended too soon . But I guess it had been quite some time since my first day as a police officer

I’ll just say, that was the first one I ever saw in my life. It was like being in a restaurant for a month or two, and every time I saw one, I just wanted to see the next one too. And yet I always felt like the last one. That was the way I felt at the time. And as time goes on and so, so do things, too."|0
I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office ( OK - it was the quiet one -) and I have to agree. It is funny, really. But then, I’m like, “Yeah, what the hell, it’s funny!” … I’m definitely not in the movie business and it’s funny, but then again it was the silent movie. I could see why that’s a problem ( I’ve done some of these movies but I know it isn’t the case) because this was the silent film.|0
There are actually some good reasons, why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching this show. The breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is an ideal place for just taking it easy and not worrying too much about getting eaten by a rubber shark. It's always good to remember, that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god.|1
We 've all seen bad movies , well this one takes the cake . I 've seen that Junior movie and it looks like he was trying to be nice , but I 'm not too proud to tell you this was the worst movie my dad did to me , and now I think it has a lot to do with the fact I never watched any of it , so when you have seen 'em they are like that , and I 've never seen 'em ever since my dad bought 'em they 've all been at it , and 's been in the middle of the day , so he 's been kind of busy .|0
This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper, and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The movie is long, and drags on with a documentary style of showing Gabrielle Union, who has died in the movie, talking about her family; which by the way is a confusing family because you never know who's who, and who's related to who. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I could take it back where I got it from.|1
"In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything ""real"" about this legend need to grow up. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. You guys seriously need to grow up.The fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. The fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from Tennessee believe it doesn't do it either."|1
Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good !!! Thought it was a lame ass movie, but not at all, many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying. This movie has enough blood, gore, and some sexy make out scenes of course, to keep any horror buff like me 100% satisfied! The cast was also pretty good IMO. Even though its not a high budget movie, the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes. Worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure!|1
"Can you people please stop believing everything this man says . Getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar . If you don't believe that this is a true lie, then you are being silly, and not trying to get your facts right. . The truth is, you know . . . well, just look at what his lies are and what he says are. ""The truth isn't really all that important. It's what we have to go on about,"" he says. ""It's all about what the man said to me."|0
This movie narrate the story of John Belushi,based of his biography `Wired' , wrote by Bob Woodward.All of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of John Belushi we see one angel accompany Belushi during few points of his life.Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of Belushi ,and his play stay only a pale animation.The director,on more,not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused.|1
I saw the trailer for this film before watching Titanic , and I must admit that it whetted my appetite. I’d never watched any movies of Titanic until I found this one. It’s an incredible film. I’ve seen many movies of Titanic since it was released at the end of the film. The story is similar to the one in Titanic: a ship that sails in the right direction; the crew is in a good way, the ship is heading towards a terrible place and the ship is going to die and the crew wants to do something.|0
Like a lot of people , I loved the original ; `` American Graffiti '' was one of the greats in my mind, but I realized that this was just a silly story of a very simple idea, and not something you would be able to relate to. I'm really glad to have seen it in English. I hope we can make it into a reality, but if it doesn't look like it could be an important reference point, then please don't make it that much of a story as it would make you wonder if we had done anything right in the first place.|0
I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible. Instead I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better. Don't make the same mistake I did. The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack, but can't pull it off. The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines.|1
* Minor spoilers * I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films , this is one of those movies that I can enjoy the most because it shows so many people at a time. It is a movie that really has a special place in the heart of a story, but the movie doesn’t. It is not going to be a movie, but an action movie with a unique twist that you will enjoy. In this review, I am sharing the most important story, why I believe it makes the movie so great, and why it is so great on my watch.|0
I liked this movie , not because Tom Selleck was in it , but because it was a good story. I was not expecting to find myself in that kind of film, but because I saw this movie again. I was not expecting to find myself in that kind of film either. But after seeing this movie, I was more than curious why it didn't work for me. I wanted to learn more. When you've seen this movie, you're curious. This isn't a bad movie, because it was a good movie for me.|0
If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following , then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected in some other way. That has been one of the main reasons they made it in the first place. On a related note , I have a feeling that if they really do make it in this direction, it might be an interesting article, but I don’t think anyone would be surprised. Thanks again, Christopher. I have to agree with the other commenters that I can see them making it in this direction.|0
After the success of Star Wars, there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies. This was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly.A group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed off (the people not the dinosaurs). Porn-movie level acting. Cheap special effects, even for the time, although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them.Costumes were pure 1970's, as were the hairstyles. Ahh, the 70's. I expected a disco to break out at any minute.Nothing to really recommend in this film.|1
I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful , but damned if it did n't break new and that if it did, and if it broke a new piece of the world, that's where they got it from. I bet that was true and it would do a lot more damage. If they couldn't stop it, then I bet they didn't have any good reason why they didn't, so I don't know. But if it broke something, they could. And then maybe it did. They'd have to find out for themselves why it was happening.|0
"The setup for ""Nature of the Beast"" is ingeniously simple, and fraught with limitless potential for suspense: harried salesman Jack (a very domesticated Lance Henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed 'Hatchet Man' is dismembering people in the desert. Sounds great, right? Sort of like ""The Hitcher"" meets ""Psycho."" One or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems!"|1
Okay , so I love silly movies . If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies , over the top movies , you can read about them on the Internet. They will help you understand and enjoy the movies as well as the movies with a little bit of background knowledge . When you think about movies or movies that you enjoy . They are all fun and amazing movies that you are likely to like. If you have not experienced a movie in a few years , if you are planning to watch it again , there you can try to find the movie with some background knowledge .|0
In the European TV industry , movies like this one are called `` stickers '' . TV stations buy them to sell their content to other stations in the TV sector, where they have a lot of content that they want to distribute. But it doesn't make a whole lot of money. The TV stations pay to be able to sell their content to the TV broadcasters, even if it doesn't make enough revenue. So, if one station is not interested in making a profit from their stickers , they will be forced to make a lot of extra money.|0
I acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it I found that even the mighty IMDb didn't have it listed. That should have been all I needed to know.With Friends Like These is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate Twilight Zone / Outer Limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film. Of the three stories, the only one that I gleaned any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man (of sorts) grows out of the bacteria in a guys fridge.|1
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Well, parts of the Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. The Final Executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by Edra (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr. ).|1
The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics . While the theme seems common , it may not be so common, for it seems that there is more than one, or at least one, or all three. And, in a few words, there is a common theme which holds for every American politician: that politics is the best place to start. America is a political party, and it’s a party of the working class. It is the party of those who do not share the same views as their parents or grandparents in that country.|0
Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film , but for the kind of movie they're going after. Hollywood has become much more important to the media than it has been in the last couple decades, so I'm not sure where they're going with this, but here's the thing, this is a good movie. It's not bad, it's a movie that was released a while back. It's not even bad at all. I'm not going to lie, I'm not sure what they want to do with it.|0
"Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so it was with sheer excitement I was able to attend at the ""Rolling Thunder"" screening at the Parisian french cinemathèque with surprise movie on the 17th Dec 2004. Of course the surprise movie was The Exorcist and most people were there for that (I was too). The film was then finished but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other movie I forget (Was it Conan?). Anyways, apart from that the movie was finalized."|1
The director is sweet , as is his co-directing wife Shira Geffen , but their movie sucks . It has to be a great movie . I would have said that they have a huge budget, but when they take a budget and cut it at all, they lose money to what they do with it . . . It’s a great show, but one that has to be done at the expense of other studios to have a shot at a really great movie . . . I wish they would have done more.|0
Note : After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the book itself. What I was wondering was whether or not the book is actually a TV series (or if that is simply a fiction), and whether or not it is written about the series. And if not, when did it actually begin? I don't think the writing was done before the events of the book, so it's fair to state that I don't get the feeling it was done when it first began. This is a bit of a strange one indeed.|0
When a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly...Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat.|1
`` The Long Kiss Goodnight '' is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller , and a career breakthrough for the actors and actresses in the cast. In this action thriller that has become one of the biggest movies of the last 20 years , and which is one of the hottest films of all time , the movie is finally getting the job done , and the actors are doing everything to make the film a hit , so it's pretty exciting. It has some great characters , great acting style and the actors are very nice.|0
"If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc. ), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. The story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines. The final reworked rendition of ""The Christmas Story"" poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy goes a long way."|1
Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it's not without trying...Actually, it is. It's a shamble all the more because it's writer/director/technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. Sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story.|1
"""The next Karate Kid"" is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of Julie. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is funny and charming and I cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is. I definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie."|1
There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought, made you laugh and captured the time period right; this was one of them. Cage is Hillarious, so is Forman who from her bio unfortuatley has dissapeared from the Hollywood limelight. I'd love to see this released on DVD with in a special version with commentaries by Cage and Forman. Wishful thinking, I know. Ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend, rent this, Sure Thing and 16 candles and Breakfast Club.|1
"This is a snuff movie. I'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library. And, Bill, Julia, and all other ""professional"" actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. I thought I was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. It was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie."|1
"Oh , Yawn . Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even more. You're supposed to play this one out, and you can't. So that's what they say."" ""I'm a little concerned that you're about to lose it all."" He shook his head. ""Don't be. You look tired and stressed out, so what's your plan?"" ""If I did that, I would love to lose you again. If I did that, I'd lose you."""|0
This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised . As a matter of facts, the theory is extremely simple, but to anyone with enough understanding of the language it is not very hard to get a grasp. It isn’t hard to make use of this theory – I will call it the classic theory. It has been used extensively for many decades by many people, many of whom I’m not sure I understand how it works. It is based on the same premise as the other theories mentioned above.|0
cool flick . enjoyable to watch . hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon . i really like the way he keeps it up . and i like how he always talks about being the best . if you watch him , i am sure he can tell you he is the best . thanks . i was going to put it all down to just how much fun he is in these videos, but the rest is great as well as great music for a couple of months . hehehehe . i thought the music was great but when i was going to put out some of them , i was really impressed .|0
` Rock star ' is not on its way to any ` stairway to heaven ' category as one of the few 'succeeded in 'suckering off the stage for another year. They 're only two years away from their first gig. It seems like a bizarre move, but one that will certainly have fans cheering on the team, and fans cheering for one another, on the big stage. Yes, fans are there. It's all about doing good. You're a rock star, you know. You can say you're a rock star.|0
Seriously engaging , intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best . Mean , gripping , moody and captivating , and not at all overstated . I am genuinely amazed to read that there is no better movie to do than this . I have just returned to the internet and have a few more posts. I was recently asked if I was interested in watching a film and have been really interested so far. As I said before, the first movie in my list of recommended for a read is “Dueling in the Wild,” which is actually an American sitcom.|0
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie. The only problem is it isn't very well done.My brain is still insulted from the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala The Weather Channels commercials. Why would watching local news footage of a washed out side-street give insight to global weather patterns? You got me.Also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man.|1
"This movie purports to show a middle class family's attempt to figure out what is ""going down"" in the America of the late 1960's. Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes.If you want to know which well-established Hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days,.. just look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids! Thank God, his career rebounded before his untimely death.The writers on this television turkey were clueless."|1
This movie did n't do it for me , an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years . Jamie, you did it for me . You're such a nice man , this movie has brought so much joy into the world of SNL. You're such an outstanding person . . . You make me laugh , you make me take my first breath . I hope you liked this movie too . It's got so much potential , it's a movie for everyone , you should keep an eye out for it . I'll have to see if it works out .|0
Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little Vasque town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of Obaba. Any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, well, that's not saying too much.|1
Valentine, a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad, they plan to meet up in England, but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker, she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and she returns it to her owner, a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper, listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often, often becoming part of his eavesdropping games.|1
I've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed dull to me, much as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out. It also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. It's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor.|1
I have watched Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now. I enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. It is refreshing to see a G rated movie. This is a feel good movie. The story is mostly from the view of the children. The interactions between the kids and the adults makes the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family film. If you liked the Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy this. I viewed this movie on cable. Either on Encore or Showtime family.|1
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production . Martha Coolidge herself said she only wants to know where he lives and where he travels, and what he does and how much he gets for a single trip . It is also good movie that has some flaws . And the fact that she just wanted to watch the movie . she also wanted to know where she goes and how much she gets for a single trip . It is good movie that has some flaws in its production and the fact that it was just a one shot .|0
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! I related to the character Ann August more than most would. My Mother isnt AS eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of lonliness is the same. This movie is perfect in the ating aspects, and Natalie's, and Susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away.|1
There are so many things wrong with this movie I do n't even know where to begin . The story isn't funny, it doesn't work , it doesn't feel funny . It's just the same way you would expect, but at the same time there are so many good moments, some of which have been overlooked and others not. And the only one I want to talk about it. I'll leave you with what you've read. You've read a lot . You've read several books , some have been published .|0
In America , the Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer ( Elijah Wood ) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection in his autobiography. He tells the story of what happened to him when he was a young young man. In the book, Foer describes what happened as a boy. “I remember I was seven, my father said to me. My father said, Well, I’m older than my mother and my mother and my father, and I’m ten years older than my mother and my father… When I was seven, my father said, I’m about to break my heart.|0
Another sequel! Why on earth do they keep making these? This has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever, yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I only watched so I could officially trash the whole series - brings back the evil straw-man who, again, butchers up some college kids... That's basically it. The acting sucks (as usual), the death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think.|1
"From the start of ""The Edge Of Love"", the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. This movie is based on Thomas' writings about love and romance."|1
I normally do n't like romantic films , but I love this film very much . The story is really interesting . It has some interesting twists , but this is the most funny movie of them all . This movie is a little slow , but it seems that the dialogue is good . It is nice and funny . It also is very interesting . !!! !!! I liked this film very much, I am sure I will watch it again soon . The story is interesting and the ending is really good. The plot is interesting too .|0
"Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. The Lone Ranger is not camp, but ""the"" icon for good-doers all over the world. And it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released.Whelp, long story short, the single saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that in that year, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus Ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over Mr. Moore's treatment."|1
A snore gore . I saw this piece of horrible , stinking , worthless , junk at the Cameo Movie Store last week and I am just about to take it home and get it done . How the hell did they get it . . ? I mean, that piece of shit sounds like they did something stupid . . . The only thing I can say is that they would have never thought to buy it when I saw it on the movie night stand . And I have to admit they were a bit disappointed . . . They’re not in any way stupid .|0
Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the gorgeous Julie Delpy) from committing suicide in Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He does not know that she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie.|1
"This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan. Back in the mid-80's I taped this movie (when VCR's were impossible to do this with!!) and would watch it over and over. Nicolas Cage is just brilliant here. And, he looks wonderful and has no affecting ""acting-isms"" (see ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" to know what I mean about that!!). I measure all his performances against this one. He was so perfectly cast as the cool punk guy with the edgy friends."|1
If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick , it would be recognized for what it is. But that is the truth of what I have been asking myself many times. I want it to go away and give people the opportunity to talk their feelings about the film and find out what they're going to find. It won't solve the problem for me. Well, I’ve had the best experience of my life with this kind of film. “No matter what we did, we did it.|0
I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV . In some sort of odd , surreal manner , it was the first time a game was to be aired for the television audience. It was the first time that two games were to be aired live on MTV TV. There were six seasons of the first series aired on the MTV TV network, from July 2006 through December 2007, and eight episodes were shown in each season. The first season of the TV series premiered on February 1, 2008 and went to the final season on April 30, 2008.|0
"When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the film. And I was really impressed by it. I got goose pimples and I said to myself that I HAD to watch this film.And I did, and I've to say: This film is amazing. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message... The message of this film is one of the most important ones: ""Make love, no war"". This film is a real masterpiece."|1
"The four LA cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd , and even more bizarre in front of them than they were before. A police car is not going to help. (AP Photo/John Locatelli)

Now that you’re probably already familiar with LA, it may not surprise you that a police car does help. It’s often the driver who gets the most attention, but it can’t do much more than keep people in their cars on the road, either. When they get to LA that’s because they can see it."|0
Years ago, I used to watch bad movies deliberately. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture rings true. No facial expression fits the scene or the action. I've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. At the final scene, I was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.Only one name in it I ever heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must've been very hungry to take this part.DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!! !|1
Jewel Thief is *THE* crime thriller of Bollywood, and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 R D Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyricsEven if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes. Helen, Tanuja, and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.)|1
I found it hard to care about these characters , who were either annoying or insipid , all living their lives as they worked to earn some money . . . and some of these were a little too cute . . . not to mention some were bad . . . Some of you may remember that I wrote a piece in 2009, for an article that I thought should have been a book. I was pretty sure that this wasn't a book. But this is just a quick read for you to understand why you are here.|0
I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I couldn't say it better. The worst movie I've ever seen... and I've seen lots of crap! When I read you comment I thought only about the thoughts I had while watching the movie. When I saw who was one of the script writers I understood it. Balagueró uses the same tricks in all his movies. And his scripts are not much better either. And, of course, in Barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young Americans coming on vacations.|1
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate. It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life. There is about twenty minutes of magic, and absolutely no scary or thrilling moments. Our actress are treated like pieces of ass, and seem to be perfectly happy with their position. The lead characters, these sons of ipsmith are walking poster boys for any pop culture clothing store. You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.|1
I saw this movie on TV and loved it ! I am a real disaster film fan , and this movie made me cry . It was awesome to watch the movie but after watching the movie, I got bored and just watched it again . I can only imagine why people would like to see another movie but I guess it was because the movie was just not that great . And I can’t think of a time when it was so good that I would want another film , especially this one . But I am a real girl and I love movies.|0
Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too.|1
"Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed ""The Guardian"". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.Even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible."|1
"'The Mill on the Floss ' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans , who wrote under the pen name, ""The Mill on the Floss "" and ""The House""/"" "" at the end, ""was published as a sequel in 1887"". ""Mill"" is also the title given to the first book of the series in 1894. Production 
This book has been made into a book of a second book. It includes two stories and is set in Ireland and Britain, and includes the second book."|0
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.Rupert Grint played the part marvelously, and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot, and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. This reminded me, in a way, of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not by means of actual content of the film, but the premises, and overall tone to the film itself.|1
Take a bad script, some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you get? Something that is supposed to pass for quality family viewing.Seven Alone is the story of a family in the 19th century who travel across America in a wagon train, hoping for a new life in Oregon. There are seven children (three boys, three girls and a baby whose sex I'm not quite sure of) hence the title of the film.The story opens up with the family living a seemingly normal 19th century life on a farm in the middle of nowhere.|1
If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one . I wasted a good amount of time to put this up . I am sure you have been reading this one before I did it for this article . I am going to be honest . If you have not done any research on it , I will suggest you have a read on this article and if not , then take a look . Thank you very much . Just to show you what I did in my first article, it is really interesting.|0
This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother Angela who is a dressmaker doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains to Mother Superior (Kathy Bates) but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs. Bruno's father Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him.|1
Even though this film 's trailer and poster imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character , I might not be a fool. I can't think of anything wrong with a post made in the UK by a British girl. The poster is the same one I just found in one of my favourite video blogs. The pictures I've taken show the girls, but there are so many more on the site, so it may take some time before I can decide. Anyway, I have been looking around for some images of this film for a while, and I think it's a good thing to see it.|0
The name of this film and the clips that I saw caused me to believe that this film would have been more interesting if I had known about it in college. I did not, in fact, know of the original film, but I had it on my mind when I was at university. And while I had been a college student at the time, I still wasn't sure about the original film, or if the original film was actually being played in a film class, or if it was a play or something else.|0
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film, except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. First she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord Jim Brown money, she becomes Brown's property.|1
The makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible. Alas, with TV movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap Cosmo questionnaire films. With a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. Not here though. The film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. oh, and the less said about the ending the better.|1
Zachary Scott does what he does best , i.e. , plays a worm , in `` Danger Signal , '' in the same way as a fish. The worm is a worm whose larvae can't survive. I've found that there are many worm forms of worms, and many that are not as well known in science. I don't get why this would be so. I think it would be a good time for science. I know that I'm not a scientist, but I'd like to make a scientific comparison. Is this the kind of comparison scientists have?|0
I saw this movie when I was very young living in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood, and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autographed photo. This movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur, and besides Jean Peters in the starring role. It also stars Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 in color and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes.|1
The acting is awkward and creepy , and not in a good way ... at all . The writing , the sound , the costumes , the actors and even the director, have been there in the show to make it look even more impressive. If you were looking for something more mature, check out the reviews and the teaser video. You can watch the original here . And of course the rest of the world will have it too. And don't forget to visit the trailer of ‘The Great American Game’, which is also available at the site.|0
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film ? ! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER , if I can help , and she could even make a few more good-friends , so I'd love to know how the story would feel. She could do some more good friends, too! That's pretty good. But there's still an issue - and I'm sure there are some really good things going on here, which is something I've never been good at but I'd love to be honest.|0
As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority , I was n't sure what to expect when I tuned into this group. I have no idea why you are here. This has been happening for a few years and I don't think any of us would have expected anything less. It's my personal opinion, if you are in a group, I don't think you're going to fall in love with the group. Even if you fall in love with the sorority, the rest is up to you! I think this group has really been a blessing to both you and the sorority.|0
I never read the book. Now I don't really want to. I had no clue what this movie was about when I walked into the theatre. I still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across, but I do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. Two precious hours I can never get back.The storyline was so predictable, it's laughable. Werewolves...or something...a very Romeo and Juliet type plot. I predicted the endig within five minutes into the movie. And I was correct.The acting isn't horrible.|1
One would have expected Hitchcock 's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution . . . It's easy to say what Hitchcock and his cast did not do on the opening night, and now we have one of those films that, if true, may be worth a watch. But the director, who has worked with many luminaries like Jean-Luc Godard and Richard Armitage since the dawn of film history, was a star. And that is the kind of film it was, of course. In fact, they didn't do a thing to make it that way.|0
This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror , so far this season Masters of the Heavens will be coming to life with this show and I thought it was a good time to mention that I just love this game. It's an RPG but there is also a lot of cool visuals that I'm looking forward to. I've already reviewed it, I'm happy to get to know it more, I haven't read it all yet because of some plot holes, this is a quick review and it's been pretty fun.|0
"I must admit that I didn't get around to seeing this movie in the theater. As it was released at the beginning of a summer blockbuster season, this cute little film couldn't help but get a bit lost in the shadow of multi-million dollar special effects movies, could it? ""Return to Me"" has a lovely and simple story at its core, and is extremely well-directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who has been in a number of major pictures as an actress herself....along with this one!)"|1
"I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Of course as I'm sure you know that ""Malcolm's in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz, and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes ""The Amanda Show"" starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure that we can all re-late to. The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard(Frankie) and his friend Kaylee(Amanda)going onto an adventure in Hollywood.SPOILERS AHEADAs it begins Jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems."|1
Rowan Atkinson 's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy , Buster Keaton , the Marx Brothers , James Baldwin and A. E. Milner , among other greats of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as being the greatest living composers of all time. I have not yet read all of these great books, but what I find fascinating is that many of them are about real people, real people without any connection to the real world. They are full of metaphors to the real world of modern music and, to some people, they are not real people.|0
The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie . This one sounds more like a disaster than it actually is! In the early morning of June 30th, 2011, there was an earthquake in an area that was home to a volcano that spewed deadly fumes, ash and ash products into the air. It is now time to move on, because that means you need to get a little help. As I sat in my car, with all the passengers and passengers of my car, I realized I had never been inside of the volcano before.|0
I can just picture how this movie came to be : '' So how else can we screw up our society? We all know how bad a society was for us. But some of us had to go through the same thing a lot of the time. For example, I've been trying to get my father to come to America to meet me on the plane. So I have to think about how it might have been because I was the only American, and it was hard on my own father. We had to make up our minds about this movie as it was coming.|0
Here is a movie of adventure , determination , heroism , & bravery . Plus , it 's set back to history , the first movie of a family's lives . You'll see that it was created by a man, a man, and his family . And a lot more than you might think. The movie is more of a historical mystery than a romance. It 's about a family of warriors who have lost their family to battle, but the battle seems to be over before they know it's over. They still fight the battle to save their loved one for his family .|0
I couldn't stop watching this movie, though it was far past my bedtime. Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. It walks a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark, distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her, at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear, at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out.|1
This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people , two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah , and two of whom are actually the most successful members of the party in the country . They all seem very different from each other, but are actually in the same world. . They all feel that their time in office is over, and so do the two of them . How do they work ? . . . So how do they work? And how does their relationship to the real people in this world really work ?|0
This movie was completely stale and uninspired. The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee. I did not laugh one time during the entire movie. I could have sat in any barbershop in America and have heard this banal banter, and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut. I cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here were funny or worth caring about.|1
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere).A haunting, intimate portrait of Loneliness, and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent, and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm Calling From).The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.|1
A girl named Isobel becomes possessed by a demon . The local priest ( who formerly dated Isobel 's sister) has asked that the girl be moved to another priest's house . The girl gives the girl a message about a priest in the city . The girl then goes outside to the police station and asks the priest if she can make a report to the police after they have made the report . The girl tells the priest to send her a letter . The priest takes the girl's letter and calls the police.|0
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought I'd pee. They don't come until after the halfway point, but when they do, oh God...you will die.|1
Man , I ca n't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie . Okay , it sure was a rough one . The only problem was that the plot wasn't even fully developed at all . ???? If you can believe this, your first thought was to try and read the script. That was kind of strange. The characters seem to be a little off , the ending seems a little strange , the dialogue is just too dry . I would like to apologize for not writing this script and not being able to work out the details .|0
A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island.To get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and I think the script intended disastrous results.Lets start with the one thing I really did not like about this movie.... The monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit.The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. OK thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this B movie.The best thing was John Rhys-Davies(his daughter the eye candy a close second.|1
When I think of a 1970s-period film , this is not what I think of . I do n't want to take pictures of what people are saying , but what they say about other things is what people are saying. In this movie , I have not seen anything that is similar to this movie but I have seen both . This is actually a very interesting movie , but it was very slow . It had many scenes and scenes that weren't good . I did a lot of research on movies that do this and also found that there were so many scenes that were bad .|0
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( Vern and Sarah ) , each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past . Fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key, noirish journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life. Aided by her , anything but enthusiastic, male friend, the two of them reach the end of their quest , but with a price to be paid.|1
Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie I couldn't understand more than about 15%(the fancy English couple in the 3rd story included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, none with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of foul language. Didn't find it funny, didn't find it amusing, didn't find any sense in it.|1
Take a bad script , some lousy acting and throw in a politically incorrect morality tale and what do you know of what's happened to us in the world today . I just read this thread, and I've come up with a number of theories for this story, as well as some examples from the movies, television, and literature, and it's been pretty bad at it. I have never read any good literature or movie before and have absolutely no interest in trying to figure out what has gone on in this world.|0

Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong rights whilst challenging the MAN along the way. He has two enemies, that no good Willie Green and the sleazy mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, slap and pimp his way across the screen. What's the man's name? DOLEMITE!Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and performers. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the seventies. Self produced and marketed he catered towards a specific audience.|1
"I just caught this on Showtime...ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. One of the lamest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the ""secret base"" was the house from Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is located in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors."|1
The most intense and powerful film I have seen in years. There have been other films before that delved into the Vietnam Vet but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwrenching film, as a typical American suburban family, circa 1972, comes apart at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls. The cast is A++++ fantastic with all four actors(with Kathy Bates a stand-out) giving riveting performances. What is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides, but understand all four characters and empathize with them, even though all four have divergent viewpoints and needs.|1
Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh ( Min-Sik Choi ) is bailed out of his hospital in Dae-doon-dong ( Min-Dae-dong) by his father-in-law.

After he receives the bail, he goes to Seoul police station to catch the Bus Dae-su Oh, which he killed. He is sentenced to a five-year prison term of three years in jail and suspended from his job for life, according to Seoul Police. “We just want to get away.|0
"If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I am a huge fan of ""B"" movies, and I have seen my share of bad ones, but there is not a letter in the alphabet that could adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified puke. This movie even surpasses the ""so bad it's good"" phase and goes straight on to the ""so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it"" phase.It is hard to say what is more disturbing: .1."|1

... with a 500 $ budget and a bottle of ketchup.If you are a fan of C movies with no budget, then make sure you buy them for your entertainment budget. They look like you are sitting on the edge of a beach, or in a park. You should go to the beach or on the plane. You can also buy all of your movies at the movie store. I suggest you buy a couple movie tickets for those you need to see. I suggest you buy as many tickets as possible for all of the movies.|0
My girlfriend wanted to see this ( lol this is the case a lot ) ... so I rented it from a porno guy at his apartment and they gave it to her to see what she wanted. It's been a little bit of a mess and she is a little disappointed with me because she didn't ask me to do it because I don't own it, it's too expensive so I just rented it myself... The problem is, I have no way to access the porno page. This is my first time using the porno page and I am going to take her photos.|0
I love this movie . At first , I did n't expect much of this movie since I did n't see the movie . I just saw the first trailer . I'm so happy for you and the whole community , it was such a great film! I just saw a lot of trailers. I loved it . So glad you loved it . Thanks for reading the story . I would recommend it to everyone . I just saw a lot of trailers . I'm so glad you loved the movie . I'm in the mood to review this movie.|0
Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick . And of course they do their best to change this. The reason it is not easy is because it will take a lot of work to set up this . And it will take time to setup. The main thing I want to say is that I have no doubt that you will be doing this to a lot of friends and acquaintances . In this case, I’m not going to say that I am the most difficult to deal with. It is possible to do a lot of direct to video action films on the cheap.|0
"I've seen worse films. This is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. It rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre.It is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. Awfully charming rather than just plain awful.The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. Upon turning up she exclaims ""Bunnyfluff!"" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!"|1
2001: A Space Odyssey Is it a sermon? An account of the history of mankind? An exploration of man's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him? Is it about the fragile balance of time and space? A lesson in evolution? Or is it just a spectacular effects show; a film Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words? 2001: A Space Odyssey is all of these things.|1
There's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me. You get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems, yet I feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward. It's about perception. There are characters the heroine Nicole(Jaimie Alexander)meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish. This might seem like a spoiler, but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part.|1
After sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film , and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out on the screen for this film , this movie is just a joke . One of my favorite movies of all time , and the reason it has been so successful in my eyes . It's about a family of twins who decide to live in an apartment complex on the West Side of Manhattan . In this movie they try to use their power to make it look like a real place. If the apartment complex is not what they intend it to look like, the real thing will come to life .|0
First of all , before I start my review , I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie ' and I was really happy with it. But I can't help to say, there was no way that the movie is as well as I imagined. I'm still not sure if I really believed the book. I've been waiting on the DVD for so long now, but the movie looks great. It's not a bad movie. And I've just watched it. And I love it. It's a wonderful film, and it's good.|0
"I absolutely adored this movie. For me, the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like ""Boston Legal"" or ""Ally McBeal"" or even ""LA Law."" This is REALITY. The law is not BS, won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt, like the ""Chewbacca defense"" on South Park.) This is a real travesty of justice, the legal system gone horribly wrong, and the work by GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype, who use all of their skills to right it."|1
As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago, I think I should know. For the past four years I’ve been working on the same issue but this time I want to make a little bit of a difference. This time I’m going to make a couple changes in the topic. The first is that I want to do the same thing the other times this is done. If you are doing something that I want to do and I don’t feel like you can write this in your article, here it is.|0
I 'm going to recommend putting this one in the `` skip it '' pile as well . I was thinking it's going to be a bit heavy , since this is where I will look to be going on a long term project to add more features , which I'm not particularly fond of but I don't believe it is the right time to get started . I need some help looking to see how things are going so I have a few things to do . It would be a good thing if someone could help me with this but I am not experienced with any of these issues.|0
"The worst movie I have ever seen. The sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...I first tought: ""Oh No, I don't want the trail that proves that poor Patrick was an innocent killer"". But this turned out to be even worse. Typically in this American film you get a super-hint or no hints at all. I want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer. The audience isn't involved."|1
There is a point in the film where the female boss of the `` death machines '' ( a multi-ethnic organization that was originally formed by a man who is the son-in-law and is also the father-in-law of a woman) is the hero, and it's that hero, too, that he has to fight for and defend. He must fight because he is not a man. In the end, he is just as a man-made man (if you were to assume that a female-in-the-making woman is the character for a '' man-made woman'').|0
Solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored. The acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solo's creator Bill) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it WHILST you where watching the film. That said, such films are more about the action than the plot/acting and, as such, live or die by the action set pieces - that after all is the point of such films - to give 14 year-olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance.|1
OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films. With all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated.The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard).Unfortunately the movie sucked big time. It was a real disappointment for me because I'm a huge fan of both Shrader and Friedkin's (RIP) original 1973 film.What was wrong with it? Most of it actually. The FX (you would think that the Matrix and LOTR digital revolution never happened: it was so badly rendered!|1
A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980 . It was playing in my neighborhood, I believe. I was watching it when, I thought, you know, one or two years after it opened, I was on my way to see a movie. I went to see it at a theater, and there we were. I thought, you know what? That's what it was in the movie, because it was a theater. The actors in the movie were not actors. They acted.|0
A horrendous film, ill-conceived and crude. The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of Perkins and Leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed. There was no reason to make this picture, which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. Also, there's a creeping, pervasive insensitivity in the film that isn't there in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was scary and shocking, but one could genuinely feel for all concerned, even the pitiful Norman Bates.|1
Some films are just plain silly beyond explanation. This is one of them. Words cannot do justice to the wooden acting, the stupid plotline, and the ever-predictable outcome. About the only thing that makes this film halfway worth watching are the scantily clad women (and the mute guy for you ladies) in it. The leader of the warrior women and Valeria are quite appealing to the eye. But that's about all this movie has going for it.Some silliness in point: One scene, when they start to journey to the lair of the Dark One, they are walking away from a supposedly destroyed land.|1
I would like to thank you for giving me a chance to be one of the first to actually view the film. It really does grip you. John Paul does eventually get to see the light and make a life for himself away from being tied to his mothers apron strings.I imagine there must be so many families these days in the same position (especially with children leaving home older but I wouldn't say wiser) with very sad parents who haven't really got lives of their own and who make their lives a misery.I think this film should definitely have a wider audience.|1
The opening scene really got me into watching the movie. However, not more than 5 minutes later, I was already gouging my eyes out. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. The one highlight of this movie was that there was a punk white midget. However, I didn't quite get the connection on how a white midget was the child of two African Americans. But I guess anything is possible. Also, why the hell was Robin in the movie?|1
"MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson 's finest and most personal films . It may seem funny to call it ""classic"" in the modern sense, but if you're a moviegoer and don't really understand it, it's probably the right word. It is ""classic,"" not ""traditional,"" in the traditional sense. It isn't. It's ""traditional."" And ""classic"" is a word, not a noun. This is not a joke, which is why you should avoid the term. It's an important warning, and one to avoid."|0
I missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week . . . but when the film's opening date was announced two years earlier (1951-17) it didn't get as well received because the story wasn't told well until the last week of its release. The film had been around for a long time and it didn't make it to theaters yet, but when the first two weeks were released it was a really good film. I can't get enough of it.|0
When HULK hit theaters in 2003 , it was n't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show came out. The first DVD was to be released only in Japan, but since then, it hasn't been available in the US and is often held up as the source of most HD movies and television shows. There is one DVD release from 2001, which tells the tale of Hulk Hogan . In the first week or so of 2003, I saw a first edition of Hulk Hogan. As a matter of fact, I was excited about it, because it was the first Hulk Hogan DVD.|0
I watched Love Life on holiday, when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting, but as whole I think Love Life is a winner, a ruby in the dust. One for all the family. A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words.|1
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jayne;credited as Billy Jacoby), and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy), were all born on the same day during an eclipse. Besides sharing a birthday, they also share a love of murder (and they're not picky about who they kill either). Young Billy, Elizabeth, and Andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too. But they can't go on fooling everyone.|1
"""The Moon Is Blue"" director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release ""The Man with the Golden Arm."" Whereas he had incensed the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words ""virgin"" and ""mistress"" in his mild 1953 comedy ""The Moon Is Blue,"" Preminger went far beyond what any movie had attempted with ""The Man with the Golden Arm"" since Dick Powell made his law and order epic ""To the Ends of the Earth""(1946) about thwarting the international traffic in narcotics."|1
I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this film. When Roger Corman released it to drive-ins in the summer of 1981, his trailer department sent out an advance trailer which was not actually footage from the film. It was allegedly footage of a naked woman being chased around a laboratory set by a monster. During the film's opening at drive-in's, irate customers complained the did not see the movie they paid to see. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off.|1
I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001 . Not only because of the psychological horror ( of which there was nothing in 2002 ), but also because I was the one watching it . In the last few days, I watched it on DVD and was surprised to see how far it could be played by the other two. This is the result of a review in the San Francisco Chronicle by a reviewer I was following. There’s a reason why this review is important for me and why I’ve spent time with a reviewer in this way .|0
"At the beginning of the movie, Ramgopal Verma says that ""Sarkar"" is his tribute to The Godfather. This one feels more like an insult. It pales terribly in comparison to the Coppola classic. Although no one was expecting Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz. Amitabh Bachchan plays ""Sarkar"", a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to Indian political party Shiv Sena's Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in Sarkar's politics at home."|1
Why would anyone make a film like this? Why would anybody invest in a film like this? Why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this? Why would any theatre show a film like this? Why would any TV channel program a film like this? Why would any critic bother to review a film like this? Why would anybody watch a film like this? Why would mental examinations not be made of the writers/producers/directors of a film like this? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good. This is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible.|1
"This week 's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun ( La Monja )

As the week drew to a close here in the UK, the British film festival was packed with all kinds of horror-cinemas, featuring some of the great big names in the industry, such as David Lean, Danny Elfman, Christopher Nolan, Peter Sellers and Martin Scorsese, amongst others. It's hard to say how much I've enjoyed my time at GV, and how many other horror films that you’ll probably never look at again."|0
Back in the 70's, a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film, Don't Look In The Basement, I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know, this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie.We begin in an isolated insane asylum.|1
Not the best plot in the world , but the comedy in this movie rules . Kelsey Grammar is wonderful . She is a wonderful actress that makes you feel at home! In the movie, Kelsey Grammar works as the main character. I love the fact that in this book, Kelsey Grammar is played by Melinda Thomas , who is the character that was used as the main supporting cast. In this book, she is the main character who was the main protagonist of the movie. Kelsey Grammar is an actress , so she makes it feel like her character was used as the main character for the movie.|0
"Is there a fire fighter cliché that is NOT used in this film ? From the opening line `` I can't think of anything in this film, except for the ""I can't do anything.'' I've seen it with many other movies, but not mine. I've seen this one before. It was supposed to be the same movie I've seen it with the same name, but they made it with the same number of scenes...

That was the first time I actually saw one, but didn't see it until it's the other day."|0
"In my opinion , a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and clear - but it should be very clear if the topic is important in a discussion and the way it is phrased. A:

It should be good for both you and your wife. There are a few things you can look for. The way to make the argument
I don't know if you want to use it as an answer, but you should do it from the side. I think you would have more control over what the argument was intended to be and what it meant for your wife."|0
I 'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do . I 'm pretty sure they didn't tell it the whole story . I can't even believe they made it up. . They were so smart . All I can say is the story was great! If it were not for them , you wouldn't have any sense of humour when they would say the thing that really upset people. But you are the only person I know who could ever really laugh at someone's reaction or say what he didn't like .|0
"This is a must-see movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and when it's over you'll wish there were more. Well-written and compelling, this movie draws you in and holds on tight. The casting was perfect, the characters purposeful, and the performances outstanding. ""Nanny"" is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong, forgiving, protective, and never judgmental. ""Nanny"", to me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community."|1
"In my analysis of `` Trois couleurs : Blanc '' I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the `` Blanc.'' I have also used the ""blanc'' and the `` Blanc.'' These two qualities together make me very doubtful about the "" Blanc.'' #3:

In this chapter I will explain how these two qualities help in the understanding of `` Blanc'' and its relationship to `` Blanc.`` As we will see, both of the ""Blanc'' and "" Blanc.'' are important and very important in our understanding of `` Blanc.''"|0
Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime. He's so fine. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end but wow. Girls are so vicious. His girl was wrong. If Eddie was my man I would never disrespect. Those Mobsters were spooky. The moral of the story is Trust No One. Your friends will hurt u if they can. Oh and Eddie tell your girlfriend that yo mine, she should move ova! I would suggest seeing the movie. Why?|1
This is one of those movies that you just don't want to end. The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes, music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken in by a dynamic, big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.I couldn't believe this was a made for television film. It was so well executed.|1
OK, a film about a film that takes a crack at Video movie making could be entertaining. Could be, should be, funny, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet... This film is the bizzaro negative version of that. Hamlin was entertaining as a 'B' Film producer. Shatner played crazy yet likable, and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, underdeveloped, boring and boring. The production value was lame. You'll actually see the boom come down in one scene.|1
Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it 's beyond funny . The `` plot '' is about an American mercenary , and there's much he can do with it . You might try some of it . He's got a gun in the glove, so there's not much he can get away with . It would be nice to have a little time to see what he gets away with . If we're lucky, he can get a pretty good chance to learn how to fire a shotgun . You might try to kill him with it . It's not bad .|0
First of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked Mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was Mongolian in it. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. But she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.But, I totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr.Bodrov. The plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion.|1
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [#4/10], with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets. And a more off-the-wall storyline too!A man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder, and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over, for one of them did the deed.|1
This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. We learn that his life has been an utter mess for a week and that this man has been in a deep hole and he cannot find him. In spite of this, the film's central theme was that it would be a good thing to get back on your horse and have a great time with the dogs, because he has no idea when the day may come. So he decides to go on a trip, and the dogs do all of a sudden make out with him.|0
Just saw this at the cinema. I haven't read the books. There is nothing new about this film at all. the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up.........|1
This movie baffled me . I could not get a grip on it . Thought I might be missing something important . I have to get to the computer, but I don't have one . I have a DVD of the movie for the first time I know . The movie is in English so I don't mind . The movie has just been released and I am going to watch it again this week and I will keep you posted . If anyone is going to watch it again (I'm going to do one more time), that would be great!|0
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect, but Rififi definitely fits the bill. No other heist film has come close to it, before or after. The plot is simple, but engrosses you. It never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it. You care for all the characters, even though they are bank robbers, because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws. It's hard to imagine any other actor besides Jean Servais in the role of Tony le Stéphanois.|1
"Not as bad as ""Billy Bathgate"" but close. Try as he might, Warren Beatty just could not be believed as Bugsy. Whenever he flipped out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. The other actors don't fare as well either. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable George Raft."|1
MR . BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes . Written and filmed as a `` light , sports comedy '' that will make the world a better place for a young man of science . Boys play baseball and play their sport with a variety of styles. And, if you enjoy baseball, you will love playing on the big screen -- it makes you smile. Baseball is very entertaining. The characters are a mix of real people and imaginary people. If there's a problem, it's that the audience doesn't appreciate the comedy. The jokes are fun, the drama is funny.|0
Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it 's hard to single one out as an actor. It may seem strange to you, but I think it's possible. This is a review I was given by the film editor. I had the impression the film was pretty much as bad as you're gonna get. So I'll say it again: I loved it. I've never seen it before and I can't find any reason why I didn't like the ending. It was an absolute disappointment.|0
I wanted to like this movie . I really , really did . I was so excited when I saw it . There were so many different kinds of films you could choose from. I would like to talk about the first . So the first one was . I wanted to say that it really really made me proud of it. I really really loved it . It was very special and I loved it so much . It was very good . I could not have been more excited about it again . It really made me realize that being a writer is important .|0
When the film started I got the feeling this was going to be something special. The acting and camera work were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.However, as the film went on, the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. I was unable to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles.|1
"The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges. The story is told from the point of view of Moe Howard and his relationships with his brothers Shemp and Jerome (Curly) Howard, also the life long friendship with Larry Fine. The movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the Stooges multi decade career. The casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble. The actor who plays ""Curly"" Howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved Stooge."|1
This movie was absolutely terrible . The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from people with reviews is that the film is so much more than what we have now . I've only seen a few parts of both films in this movie and I'm hoping for a review here . The only other reviews that I have heard so far about the film I personally didn't like is from this movie . I'm still waiting for a review here so I can review it . For the life of me, I can't figure out which is better than one or two.|0
"When I first heard about ""Greek,"" I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous. Another of ABC Family's so-bad-they're-almost-good shows. But tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected.As a member of a Greek society, I can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. And are also very fun to play with just on are own, let alone to watch on a TV screen."|1
"Well, I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, only to quote the most famous. ""La villa delle anime maledette"" is one of the most unknown movie of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today, and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies... this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome...) . But the film is not so bad."|1
I 've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now . When a writer develops a story, it's not the end of the world but the beginning. If that doesn't make you interested in writing it, it will. That's because I think it's interesting that it's written with the intention that the author will come back to the main point. But in fact, it seems like it could be done in a more natural way, so maybe it will be better. That's interesting in a way.|0
"This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard TV movie stuff, so there's really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a Jeff Bridges fan as I am I guess.Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is quitting college to go on the road. His parents believe he is ""just acting out"" and talk about how ""he has no plan""."|1
Five Fingers is so bad , that I hardly know where to begin . So let me admit first , I was a bit hesitant to start with but I have never been in that position. I was not sure whether to just put my head in front of the computer or not . At the time , I was thinking a lot about this , but at the time , it was hard to believe because I just happened to be sitting on a desk with my laptop in front of me. That was like the second time I was sitting on the computer .|0
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising but you know what they say, don't judge a DVD by it's cover. I also noticed that it won Best Actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. It just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin. The music was pretty ordinary.|1
"In case you dear readers never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man. This 80s-drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubbly Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some witty Chi-town cops who don't play by the rules. That's pretty much the extent of the movie. Interest is somewhat peaked by Hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to Will Smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like Memento's Joe Pantoliano and ""NYPD Blue's"" Jimmy Smits."|1
Maybe it 's just that it was made in 1997 , or maybe whoever managed to get this up to speed. As for how it should be fixed, I can't see any point in getting this fixed at all. The idea would be that you have to fix it in two different places at the start and end. There's going to be some confusion over this though, but if you don't have the time please don't get me wrong, the idea would make a lot of sense to me.|0
This version of `` The Magic Flute '' is not only the worst production of Mozart 's great opera that has ever been performed at the Metropolitan Opera in London but also of the London Symphony Orchestra. It has the most beautiful music in the history of the classical music and it is a great piece to work with in the hope of improving the overall performance of the work. It is also known as the most beautiful Mozart piece in the modern orchestra repertoire. It is also one of the few works to survive in the history of Classical Music.|0
The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. I did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice then, it is high time to put an end to it. I seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. Am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings.|1
"Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game , this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll . As of now, it is a terrible film , but i would have liked it to be better , if it is better , in fact, I would have loved it . But if it is more interesting , why ? Why ? Why ? So, I want to know what you guys think ? Let me know and I will try to explain my feelings. I think that there is more than that , but it just isn’t my view. 1:30 pm

It is sad that some find this film worth watching. I am Russian, and I am disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this garbage art). Balabanov wanted to shock the viewers by pervasive evil, and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive directorial work.|1
I love movies...and rarely do I see a movie that I hate...but this was the worst movie I have ever seen, or at least close to it. Any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. Hands down... I cant believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm really mad, I want my money back and my time back. AWFUL! Do not go to see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the ending is awful.|1
No redeeming features , this film is rubbish . Its jokes do n't begin to be funny . The humour of the movie , especially the humour of the original actors and the jokes are hilarious . When we are laughing , we have to see a funny movie and we have to see the funny movies , i think the funniest and funniest movies that we have seen before . Its not as funny as your typical jokes , but is funny . Its not as silly as you can get, but it is funny . Its the funniest , most hilarious and funny movie that i watch this movie .|0
I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas , and was totally switched up for it. We did a similar one this week to the one used for a different festival. This was the film we saw at the 3rd this year , and was definitely the best one in the world. But it was also one of the few movies we had in our collection. This week we also see the one we see again for the same reason. We have a limited number of these movies , which means that most of them are very different films.|0
This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie ! This is the only Kung Fu movie ! This is the only movie for you to watch on DVD or Blu-ray and get your hands on the best Kung Fu movie. If you enjoyed Kung Fu Movie please comment on it below ! If you didn’t think this video would make you sad, you’ll never find that one. And if you’re still wondering why this is the only Kung Fu Movie on DVD, why not download it and enjoy the movie as many times as you like !|0
With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie . But Weber's performance does bring us to the big picture here. First of all Weber is just great, he has a lot to live up to , he has a great director, and everything about his acting is so good. But the biggest problem with the movie is the lack of depth in the characters. So I think that Weber and the actors should be brought in for this movie. If they don't do well in the movies, it will be tough to make a movie.|0
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO. It is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater, providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale. I was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played Nanny. She is an outstanding actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony magazine did do a nice article on him, giving him some of his due propers.|1
"""Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters"" is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic oeuvre. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn't quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it."|1
"Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I've ever bore witness too. It's bad enough I wasted $3 to watch this crummy pile of crap, but it's the hour and a half time I lost that I could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. Getting drunk couldn't even help this video.To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe I actually lost a few IQ points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind-numbing ""work""! Perhaps I should have followed my own advice this time."|1
In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short , we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed `` Serpentine Dance '' of the first half of the year. This was just the beginning of her career but it was just the beginning of an entire career. This is a great time to be an activist and a part of an organization. We're looking to do some great things this year to help change the image of our country. What does your name and the name of your agency do? What are some of your other interests?|0
In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking?I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie.|1
The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. Ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story I think I've seen disguised in a slew of other films. I never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging, killing and double crossing his way to the top.|1
The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more. The leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling. So, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex Yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because (take a deep breath) the American military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad. You don't need half a brain to see the relevance to Iraq war and Black Water Company.What a load of leftest excrement!|1
"I'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people. The series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good.People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. This is not good to do, you should look at the total, not the end result. It is sad that a lot of the ""usual"" characters died but, damn, we had a lot of nice NEW characters.Please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series, the plot."|1
Im warning you people out there, this is just a waste of your time. I am being honest when I'm saying that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Its just a move about Christian propaganda! Don't throw away your life, don't see it!I think they made the movie so more people will believe in Jesus or something, but it works in the opposite way. The actors are all newbies, the story is just fuzzy!I think this movie is a work of the devil.|1
"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister.Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's ""Guyana - Crime of the Century"". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion."|1
1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 ( Dir-Brett Thompson ) : Silly , juvenile-focused movie about three kids. I had never watched it. And now I find it funny. I really don't need to be on a DVD player for my movie review. I think that's the reason why I love watching the movies, and that I love watching it with my daughter. We both love our family movies, but the kids love it because they are so young, not because of anything that they've ever done as a teenager. We like to be on our own when we see them.|0
When I finally got around to seeing this film recently , it turned out to be exactly what it looked like. It was one of the most wonderful movies I’ve ever done. I’m always amazed at how far my imagination goes, and that is something that can be fun to watch. It’s also something that I love, and it’s not only a wonderful way to spend my time , it’s also the way to spend it. I really enjoyed the cinematography , lighting and the overall effect, and I feel that this is the most important thing I can ever do.|0
Ed Wood rides again . The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope . This was an awesome movie . In addition to that it has a great story that makes it very intriguing . I don’t know what else I could do but this is my go-to. It was so good . If you have ever watched the movie you will know that I love it . I loved it . I loved the sense of being a man and going to see the movie I would never do that again . I would have to be in the movie again .|0
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential , but nothing more , because boy did I want this movie. What about the movie? I can't think of anything that would make anyone look like this. There's a lot of other movies out there but I think I've read up on more than one (or maybe two) already. I'm hoping for something different. I have an idea that I could put in at least a few dozen films in one week but it would take some work and maybe a couple of years to do it properly.|0
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies . My only quibble is that the director , Peter Yates , is one of the only actors in the cast. His role is played by Michael Caine . I loved him more in his original role than his new one, but I think this movie is the better movie because it plays more than any other movie in this series of films. It’s a story about two young girls who go missing from their parents’ cabin while their parents’ car is broken.|0
I enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious. RH3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. I think I may have laughed once - and it was during the NGs. Tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. Chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. I was able to predict EVERYTHING - who the villain was, who the girl was, (SPOILER ALERT) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc.|1
Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he ever even went back to Australia after his breakout success in Captain Blood. Still I attribute this film to the well known Aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own.Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir, My Wicked Wicked Ways.|1
"This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. Remake a classic film shot-by-shot. I hope nobody tries this technique again. In 1998, ""Good Will Hunting"" director Gus Van Sant tried it by remaking Hitchcock's 1960 classic ""Psycho"" and failed miserably. What on earth was Van Sant thinking of? This remake doesn't even come close to topping the original. The few changes that were made here were no help. If you want to see ""Psycho"", the choice is obvious. See the original."|1
This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can't figure out which is worst; Norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or Christopher Neame's hysterical overacting. This film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. The action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. You can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.Visually the film does nothing for me.|1
This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.|1
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show.|1
"Everyone has their choice for ""worst movie they've ever seen."" Some like to pick on Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some pick on classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Ever since I was 14 I have been very vocal in saying that to me, it is Problem Child 2, and 9 years later, I feel the exact same way. It's not ""one of the worst,"" it's not just an expression. It is THE ACTUAL worst movie I have ever seen.How much farting, pooping, peeing, and puking can you put in a single movie?"|1
I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by how much time I wanted to get to the next episode of the series but wanted to give the show enough time to watch and review the new stuff we’re about to embark upon tonight. We don’t have the time to review episodes of the series after the break but just because I was feeling a bit lost on a night, I am going back to the series in its entirety so I am going to do a couple of questions. Question 1.|0
I , like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to happen. I had spent the last two weeks preparing my meal for breakfast the day of my first post on the blog. On the very next morning, I decided to make a few changes to my recipe that would make for a great meal, so it was time to head for work. Today, I have been busy preparing a breakfast for lunch, dinner and dessert, and I hope you will have time to come back and enjoy the meal that I made for you for the day.|0
Sorry , after watching the credits , I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF comics. I just love the series and the characters , but they were so cute and funny . They were cute and hilarious in every possible way. The series was also really funny and entertaining. They are the only comic I have ever liked. I would like to add a bit more of that to the site, so I will add that too. I watched it a couple of times and I still remember the first time it came out.|0
"I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by Jean Arthur. Her bugging her eyes out in surprise and just generally over-doing everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was marvelous in her restraint and comic timing. She being the best thing in this movie. The Wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to ""get away"" w/being wicked,witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny."|1
I think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must 've come on and rated a movie. The people who did did, and the movie's producers did too (and the movie does not have a film critic). They should have checked it before it was a movie, as if this were a big deal at all. But we just don't. There is a movie critic. It is not in the best position. I think people should be taught to be clear on this. You shouldn't just do what you do.|0
Watched the director 's cut last night ... glad it was free rental , even a dollar would have been a big deal! I’m not sure where it comes from, or whether this was something you should know or not, but it’s something that we’ve found a way to share with each other, so to say it seems to me like a great opportunity for both of us to try and make an impact on our community. My husband and I used to go to movies in NYC every once in a while, so it was exciting to see how they ended up in theaters.|0
Why couldn't the end of the movie have been Sean Connery's men fighting the French instead of the Germans. Ever since the French had occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes from Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements. This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding Algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him.The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans.|1
I 've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80 's so I was pleasantly surprised how quickly I 'm coming into it. In short, I had a pretty good grasp on the plot of that film, though, as I've said, it's not the kind of film I would have wanted to see. (I don't know if I would've seen it for myself, I don't know if it was on Showtime or not.) But I 've definitely been attracted to it for years and I love it.|0
The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played a normal, dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that I can say about this film. In the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan Mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. Despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that Pete's Meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama.|1
"Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr. Stephens' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal ""judge"" Oliver W Cameron(..in a running gag, anytime he confronts a situation out of his control, he retreats to repeating his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who isn't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment."|1
Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe, challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and Hot babe lays as they can, But Andy seeks true love. He finds this during their bungee-jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower, when he comes across and breathtakingly saves a suicidal and heart-burstingly beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he uncovers lead he and his friends into an fast paced adventure full of action, romance, gore, and inspired humor, without ever taking itself to seriously, or striving to be anything other than a wildly entertaining 90 minute ride.|1
Based on what little i have seen of this show I do n't think I will ever watch it again but I would like to hear from any other people on the internet who can give me any tips. I have only seen this show but all i have seen of it so far I have only seen one but I want to know if I ever watched it again. It has been shown over 4 years now but I am still in shock. Thanks in advance! I would be really interested to listen to the live show.|0
It 's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into release. That's according to a review published by the BBC on Monday, when it was told to not do a screen adaptation by a producer. The BBC said the move was prompted by the film's £8.4m (about $13.6m) budget and the fact that it is likely to be made in the UK by June. It also said that no-show, no-camera screening is the only way the film is shown.|0

I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies ever. I was so sad, I thought to myself. I saw it the other day and it was a really great movie, a great movie in its own right, because it was such a shame because I had always loved it and now I’m sad, I really hate that movie. That’s why I love it, because I feel like I’ve had too much to look forward to to see this movie so much.|0
"Well it might be a kid 's movie ... perhaps but i 'm not gon na let my kids from a movie come along."" And if it were the kid's film then there would be so much interest. I think I'd love it if I had them. Well, I hope it's a boy, not a girl, so that the kids would be interested, that's good. And i 'd love to see my own kids do well and then i 'd love to see myself and then i 'd love to be the guy who 'll do that."|0
Although I saw this movie in Korea, in Korean, and therefore did not understand the language, images sure say more than enough. From what I can make of it, this is the story: Two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard. One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men. The other has to hunt him down. This movie is visually great. The swordfighting is great. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers.|1
I have only praise for this film. From start to finish it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim's musical. I am not a big fan of musicals most of them are very overdone. This one however changed my mind. I am an actor myself and have actully played Sweeney and I know how hard this role is. George Hearn gave a stunning, masterful and rounded performance worthy of the highest awards that we can give him (He won an Emmy and that's something.) Everything he does he turns to gold.|1
I saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load off my imagination. I thought I would start off this video by describing what I saw here. This was actually the first time I saw it in a documentary for the first time ever. In my review, you might notice that I didn't even have time for the film. After the film is finished, I can go back to my review on my YouTube channel. First thing you have to remember here is that the film features a man in a tuxedo and is a man in a tuxedo.|0
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work . The opening scenes are as beautiful and impressive as ever as Urusevky himself makes his dramatic entrance and the final shots are just as breathtaking as his cinematography. The cinematography is impeccable on all of the characters, and this is obviously not only a beautiful piece of work for anyone who has watched this movie, but it also shows a wealth of information to keep you going into the future as the director is a master of the art. As you might guess by now, it was an incredible performance by Urusevky.|0
"******Spoilers within******* What a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. The movie had no character development: I felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy), and did not care what happened to any of them. The movie had so many clichéd bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies.The movie was so predictable. Many times I would be saying to myself, ""Let me guess, {fill in guess} happens next?"" Yup, I was right."|1
"OK the box look interesting , the opening have great music and its kinda original , to that its all so good . I can't really tell you but the song is so good ! I played this song in college and it is very well sung. 1/10/10:

The song is a big song to me and I really loved it

2/10/10:

This song is the last in my collection and I love that it is a great song that I can play. The lyrics are good and the lyrics are funny and funny and I think it is a very good song and I think they are also very good lyrics."|0
"And one of 'em are bad movies . The title , as it turns out , refers to a killer movie and the title itself, as in a movie, refers to a dead body. It's really nice to be able to point at the killer movie and tell the story behind it. As I have said, the title itself, though, refers to the ""dead body"" part of the movie, which means that it actually contains the dead body, and not the body of a ""foul"" corpse. I can also see how it might be a good fit for a video game genre."|0
I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, was I ever wrong. BBC are dullards at pacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much BBC sucks.Ugh, the pacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. The first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. I kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would end. They wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written.|1
I went out of my way to get this film, and was fortunate to get it on VHS. Being a big Gloria Grahame fan, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Other than that, I really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching Sterling Hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department. Ms. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like her, as I do), but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot.|1
The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. I should add here that I'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.I'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin.|1
Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a flick I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue sucks too.|1
This is , per se , an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made before it made it to film and how do you see this? There are some things to look out for in the art of the film, which can be used to describe the various elements, but they also serve to show an important part of a story and not simply a specific subject. This article is simply an attempt at that, and I hope that this is enough of an explanation to help you understand how the story has developed.|0
If there are people that do n't like this movie , I do n't think they are human . This movie will be a nice addition for any fan that cares to read. Also, if I've read the movies and I like the movies , I will probably not watch it. It's not a bad movie, I've never seen it and this movie will be the most popular movie. I'll look through the review and tell you what I think of this movie. It has one of the greatest movies of the '80s , it would be the greatest movie for anybody who loves movies.|0
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake , ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake, but does that mean we don’t have a remake coming out? I mean we did say “we’ll have another in a couple months.” I’d been planning for a remake a while now, but I got a call from the director. We didn’t think that was gonna work, but they were saying it would. I mean, the original Psycho had to have a sequel.|0
Earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust . Well , parts of the Earth , because somewhere in Italy the entire Earth has been destroyed in a war with the Allies. But there has been a series of similar attacks on the planet. As you see in the video above, one of the major things we have discovered so far is the Earth has gone into this war with the Soviet Union, where it was once again attacked. The Soviets destroyed a couple of large asteroids in the asteroid belt which had formed the Earth and it was later attacked again by the Soviets on another asteroid .|0
I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because I am a polite person . This movie made me cry because I thought I would never see anything like this before . I was very disappointed in that movie , it made me so happy and that was that . I wanted to get more pictures like this with my boyfriend , I did not want to get the same kind of bad movie as this before , so I went for it , I did not understand how to make a movie that is bad , I will watch this movie very soon .|0
"This film is great! Being a fan of ""The Comic Strip Presents..."" I just knew I would love this film. And love it I do. I finally got round to buying a copy of this film early this year. However I was annoyed to find that it had been cut! So I'll keep looking at car boot sales for the original version.Anyway, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who tries to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French) by claiming to be a drug dealer. However, Dennis is overheard bragging one night in the pub and nicked!"|1
"Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once displayed a light, sardonic touch with beguiling material such as ""Whistle Down the Wind"" and the original ""Stepford Wives"", completely bottoms out here. Not only is his direction inept, he also sloppily adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing the scenery, is a hot-under-the-collar cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to exhibit some life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script."|1
GOLD RAIDERS ( 1951 ) A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges ( including Shemp Howard at this point ) – you’re on your own now, it’s time for me to get on the show now. Today, we got a bit of a peek into what they’ve been up to since it came out and what’s going on. At the end of the last chapter I saw that the three protagonists are just like any other of the three protagonists in any storyline, so they are definitely not what you would expect for a character.|0
Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are all about to see what happens to the vampire when they get back to their hotel and try to murder a girl. But before they could get their lives in for the kill, a new monster set out to get them to stop what he had started. A vampire who's been in the past for many years has a mind of his own and he's ready to attack again, but there's a chance that when he reaches his end, his mind will become his own.|0
"This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen . It shows what us what our world could be like. I hope we are all made of that for the way we are. Saturday, January 27, 2011

I'll have a couple more of those tonight and then I have to pick up my camera. I'd like to share a little of what happened this week, with a couple of my friends and a couple of me who will have to get the hell out of there with their cameras."|0
Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of. A case in progress is on the road to completion, and a police investigation is on the way for a court of appeal. According to a report on the court of appeals, the man accused in the case had a background that was as low as a child. He had a good reputation, but was only convicted on the evidence in this case. A few days ago, the police said there were witnesses who believed that the man was in trouble with authorities.|0
First, and foremost, I take issue to the title of this movie. 'Chupacabra' is not a Spanish word. The name to which they are referring is 'Chupacabras'. I imagine they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural that way, but I assure you, it is singular in Spanish.Next, I thought this movie had been done years ago. It came off as one of those B horror flicks I watched when I was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. Then it would have been kind of scary.Let's talk about the special effects.|1
"If I had to pick the most depressing movie, try to be suspenseful I've seen it'd be this one. I know about how good the original is supposed to be, it had better be better then this one. The movie's so dark and depressing but it isn't interesting to watch either-I've seen depressing ""thriler"" type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality. Vanishing didn't have that, This was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie."|1
This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. If you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. The strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom.|1
Ca n't say this was n't made well . At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took up to five minutes and he couldn't make the cut. A few of the actors also did not work at the same time. The rest were not in the film, they weren't working. The problem for me, is that they didn't work, or that they weren't doing anything at the time. At least I can feel that. But then you have to realise that at least they did do a lot more than they did when they first came up.|0
I grew up watching the `` Bowery Boys '' on the weekends and even at young an age I could tell I had a strong interest in it. I was always on my guard but it was always a time when I needed something. I tried to figure out what it was and what it was not. I was always ready to get away. When I was about 17 I put myself in a relationship with a girl I'd never been into before. That was my first and only boyfriend and he had no idea that I would be a teenager.|0
This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar named Louis(Jean Paul Belmondo). He's a single man looking wife, then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia(Catherine Deneuve). When she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears.A French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name.|1
In my opinion the directing , editing , lighting , and acting ( minus Franco ) were very good . They were good at that . They could give a hint about what we want or do we want to do . This is a good example of the difference between an acting and directing . But then if they are all the same then we would not have a good actor . But when they are all different we will still be able to have some good acting . There is a great difference in how acting works between a good actor . The acting is very different from the directing .|0
"Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. Whilst shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got progressively tenser, this just stinks. The Radio DJ, ""we must stay on air"" spends effectively no time on air. He sits on his bottom and watches the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there a single person in the USA or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word ""zombie""?"|1
There was no need for this movie , plain and simple . The original , although hated by some , is now seen as a masterpiece . The latest movie , as of now , will be released on June 3 , 2018. The movie is titled “The Dark Tower” and is set to shoot in 2018. The film will be based upon a true story by the author of The Dark Tower by the author of The Devil’s Tower. You can read more about this story on our YouTube Channel. The dark tower will be released in the UK on June 3.|0
Having endured this film last night , I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal. I watched the movie at the theater , it was not an event but a moment in my life when I realised I would not have to watch a movie that I hadn’t watched or read before. I watched it again in a later movie , I did not have the time to do it myself . But then, as I did not even read the movie and didn’t even watch it, I thought it might be the best movie I could do .|0
Loosely based on actual events , `` River 's Edge '' is a film , much in the style of `` Water 's Edge '' , that uses a short film of water, in the form of a photograph . The viewer is introduced to the water and the film itself, to see the effects, and to experience the visual effects, by listening to the music. When the water was being used to create a photo , the image was made on a photograph of the water , in which the water was made to appear as well as the image itself.|0
"I am sick of series with young and clueless people, talking about their ""problems"" all the time, self centered, boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc). ""Hack"" is a breath of fresh air, with a great actor (David Morse), a completely different plot, credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very, very good histories. I just love it!! I hope ""Hack"" will go on for a long time, because it is a great television series for grown up people, for a change."|1
Just finished watching 2FTM . The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend. They had a ton of good trailers but the trailers were just plain boring and I hadn’t watched them once before. That’s a big plus. I loved watching them on the big screen and it was so cool to get some good footage for the big screen. I was so happy that I was able to actually watch 2FTM, but I had to wait two hours for it. Then I was back to watching 2FTM as it was really hard to watch it on the big screen.|0
I just saw this movie tonight . Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie from this film, I just saw the movie at the cinema. That movie I thought it would be great because he's the guy who is supposed to be having fun with a lot of people. I think this movie was quite enjoyable. It's got a lot of good performances by the crew and it has some of the most talented actors and directors of the bunch. I think he's really good.|0
I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film . Just not believable in the role . Barbara Eden, the daughter of the author and director , plays the young writer in this play. She had been a long-term member of the BBC for three years prior to that. She was also the first English actor to play the writer in a movie since the early 1990s. She has a long term relationship with her best friend, Barbara Eden, and they have three kids together . The two are married in 2004 , but she is estranged from his family .|0

"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
This is a beautiful, yet simple movie about one man, driven to find an answer, an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around. It is heartrending, it is hilarious, it is glorious, it is tormenting, it is delicate and dynamic, I say it's genius.I have read Jonathan Safran Foer's book Everything is Illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood was starring in the movie adaptation), and I was just enraptured by the characters. I laughed out loud more than once.|1
It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax tried to pull off Shakespeare's Othello, by bringing it to modern day context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off. There were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective, however, John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, over reacted a lot in this film, causing for the down fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, eventually ending in Dessie's death.|1
Crispin Glovers' way of acting (and not only his) is tremendous. You really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect. He gives Layne this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult. As well as Feck, which role is done very well by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more imported, and that's exactly what I think is what makes choices this difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family mathers.|1
"You may not believe this , but when the credits to this movie rolled , I looked for the director of this one . I could not find the one . After this review I went over it and tried to find a guy who has made the film . I do not know the name , but that one I tried to go with and it did not work , for sure but it was not a great one

The main character is about 14 years of age, and has been known to do it for a long while , and there are many similarities with him ."|0
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful ! ! , as it 's one of the more important moments for me when I get to work and it is my first day of the week and the only thing I 've ever learned in this process is to be able to enjoy a meal and enjoy it until my body starts to fall down and all the pain that I may have had in the previous week goes away. I have had a hard time with some of the recipes and have not enjoyed them all that much yet but I don't need them to be good!|0

"Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. Set against a smoggy Phoenix skyline, post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star turn as ""the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times"" while JFK impersonator James Franciscus lounges around the fringes. Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.Oh yeah, and Bob Mitchum is in there too."|1
This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I ca n't believe that the writer and director did n't see the movie, but as I see this movie on my own I believe that the movie is about a man and his love for music. He's the guy who makes the world a little safer for everyone but himself. I don't see how he can be a great writer but he can also write great musicals that people will want to be proud of. He can also write and sing very well because of his music.|0
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club, the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. Take for example, Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her, he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle.|1
"If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber, just a look at his new film, ""Everything is Illuminated"", which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America's finest actors, but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow. Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material. The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas.For those who haven't watched the film, perhaps you should stop reading here.Jonathan is a collector."|1
Unlike one of the reviewers below , I do n't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead, but I am wondering if this is true. I read a lot of these posts, but some of them do not have much of significance. So, in this post I'll say something that could help a bit. There is only so much I can say. I'm not sure of the value that this article is supposed to offer; it seems to me that it is worth writing about, even if it is not true.|0
The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith ( Wesley Snipes ) is found. Sonni is set in St. George's, on the outskirts of Bucharest and who is also mentioned as a member of the British secret service. He is a member of the Romanian intelligence community which is a member of the Romanian national intelligence service (Minister of National Security). He is also a member of the intelligence service of the Romanian People's Party. Sonni works as a translator for French journalist Thierry Schramm.|0
The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened.The movie starts uneventfully, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train car, complete with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, the man's house is a train car, and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves, and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she's been told her grandmother is ill, and she needs to return to her home town.|1
If you think it 's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with , then I can guarantee that you are not going to go on forever. And it could all go bad. After all, you're just jealous of a girl who has been so good to you. But the thing about this is that love can only get you so bad. And that's not because of you. You're not jealous. I know that you're jealous, but it is because of me. As if you are not in love with a guy who has been so perfect in a relationship.|0
'Oldboy ' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most exciting films of all time. “There was another director I had not worked with in over 50 years. So I had to do the film in a different direction to get it to work. That’s really the thing. It’s very interesting. I think it took some time for it to come into being. I had to give my best. I was very lucky. It was the first film I was given credit for so I didn’t need to.|0
This is a poor , poor movie . Full of clichés , unrealistic moments : punching the air in celebration ! But it is an interesting movie, as you might expect . One can only hope it will be made better . It was interesting to see how the film dealt with a different set of issues . The movie was more concerned with the characters, which were more in love with each other and a bit more aggressive . This was a good start to the story . The actors were more sympathetic and were able to play a character better .|0
"""Delusion"" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. This flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. The film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. If the flick has anything at all going for it, it's B-movie diva Rubin's even performance. Don't waste your time on this turkey."|1
"That is the answer. The question is: What is the single reason to watch this movie? I loved her in ""My Name Is Julia Ross."" That is one of the best films noir of all time. Noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.She is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. That would be ""The Guilt Of Janet Ames."" This one has a spooky, promising title. It has a good cast. It has a fine director. I was expecting something dark."|1
"For the most part, I considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. You see, right then we learn (SPOILERS...if they can be called that) that the Devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! ""Prosatanos"" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for ""human greed"" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris!"|1
A remake can be successful . An adaptation can be successful . It is n't relevant whether its a remake or a new movie, but one which will be successful . By the end, I'm pretty sure it'll be a remake . I know that it was an original adaptation , but I think there are many who would rather believe they have made the best original work out of them . You can go to youtube, or check out the youtube link for more videos . The movie itself will be a new movie . It'll be a different kind of movie .|0
This movie is not the scariest of all time , but it is a great example of a campy eighties movie. I’ll tell you about it the next time this movie hits theaters! There are many ways that this movie has been released. The trailer of this movie was released in the early 90s , but the trailer doesn’t always have a sequel yet . So there is no such thing as an aftermarket trailer. You just have to find out the name of the company and its website and then get to know them and the person who released the film as well.|0
This movie, I would like to say, was completely great. I can see how many people would think that it's just a shocker film. This isn't completely untrue, but it's as much of shocker fiction as Chuck Palahniuk's books are. One of my favorite movies of all time, Bijo no Harawata is a certain type of crudely made movie that you can have just about any reaction to. It's scary, funny, silly, gross, full of off-the-top material and to some people, arousing.|1
I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the novella, I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie. The movie has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach) but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella. For one, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease.|1
This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing.|1
We get to see who the good guys are. The union. And who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. The filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. All the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film, this can help us along on hating the bad guys. This is the worst kind of film-making - manipulative and childish. The plot centers on a cop who is in-between the good and the bad, and he's stuck in this ugly film. It's boring and pointless.|1
"One of quite a few cartoon Scooby Doo films, ""Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"" turns out to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also does a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland. One annoying aspect of the film is the voices of many of the characters - American people trying to sound Scottish in this film are unfortunately not succeeding all that well (although some people do better Scottish accents than others).Daphne has come to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle."|1
`` Love Life '' explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a heterosexual, both of whom have different beliefs and attitudes towards each other. As she is more inclined towards the homosexual lifestyle, it can also affect their relationship to her, and it can also influence their relationship to the heterosexuals within the sexual community, as well as their relationships with each other. She may also find that she has a strong desire to be treated in a sexual way, in an acceptable way, as well as in a socially acceptable way.|0
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie . I came across this and rented it. . I did not know what it was . . . but I was very happy with it. . I was very surprised and happy to find it . . . it was a great movie , and the guy who made the movie in the video store was very nice . . . . . . . . . . . I will be trying it a lot for the next few years . . . The video will never go anywhere , but I hope they will make some movies like this .|0
`` Prime Suspect 4 '' continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice , Detective. If a victim of crime are to make a real claim, he is a suspect. And even if you think that you can do it, you are wrong. No one can have all the evidence that they are looking at. But they can make a fool of you. On the contrary, I would argue that in all cases it is very much like a detective doing a mystery job, because it can help you in the hunt for information about a person's true identity.|0
Watching the preview of Armored I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good movie. Anyway, that's not really a problem here, I'll give the preview a shot but if you're worried about the lack of quality then I'd recommend going in to see if there's anything there that might be an issue. There have been a ton of good movies released for the last decade or so and I don't think they'd be as great or bad as the movie that you're looking at.|0
Go to the video store and get the original . I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to get more money out of it? It does seem to be that Hollywood is really trying to make money by doing something that makes it look like it makes money, and that's a good example. A lot of people would probably disagree with the reason they don't use this term. The fact is that there is an abundance of money out there that makes movies and books and books are worth more than the income they generate by advertising it.|0
Genius or utter madness ? That depends on your interpretation of this film . I responded to it on the same page and I don't see where I could have gone wrong. Maybe I should have gone back to the beginning. I think I'll get back to it later in the week but I really don't see how I would go back. But for now I will see how this film goes in the next 24 hours. What's up? That's a very interesting question, and I've been reading the reviews and hearing comments.|0
"I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. I would feel morally remiss if I didn't disagree.Now, I am an avid fan of Masterpiece Theatre, but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television, for example, ""He Knew He Was Right"" was absolutely horrendous. ""Carrie's War,"" however, is probably the best I've seen so far."|1
I'm sorry but I just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are NOTHING like they were on this show!! Personally I'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. If anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then I honestly feel sorry for them.|1
I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad. This movie has terrible everything: The dialog is corny and cliché', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). This is so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can catch this on lifetime, I'd recommend it highly as a comedy.|1
It's astonishing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed (shaky hand-held camera and all), (generally) badly acted, unscripted mess that seemed more like a high school film project with the kids experimenting in black & white film making. Injecting mounds of poetry in place of a story does not an art film make. When we watched this in the theatre, people were starting to have fits of the giggles (us included) at the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent, meandering mess. And believe me, it does seem endless.|1
Well Folks , this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay life however , the additional downside includes poor acting , and some scenes that are of a more mature tone . In fact , a lot of the dialogue and acting in the movie comes into play in this movie and many scenes were not used during the main scenes , as a result this movie is not as well structured in a main character but is a good way to see the story unfold . The film does not play much of this in a main character but is a fun way to view the story .|0
"This movie has an outstanding acting , by Marilia Pêra , and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco. If I had to choose one, I'd choose this one. She is in control, in control. In the end, I chose the most important one. I love this movie by the most talented director in the world: Marilia Pêra. A couple weeks ago, a friend sent me an email saying, ""This is your chance to tell you what this movie is."" I've been following the film closely, so this post is the one for you."|0
Well , I think I 've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie ! I read the review in the book that I was going to buy the movie now . Well . I did buy a movie and I think I 'm doing well . I don't know if this will be the best movie I've ever seen . Anyway I'm going to read and review the review of Woody Allen and that was the first time I had to review it for anyone . Thank you so much for your patience and help . Thanks again .|0
This is a very enjoyable , fluffy , glamorous musical from the 40 's . 'Cover Girl ' made Rita Wilson's appearance at the London premiere of this musical in June 2014, which also featured her guest appearance in the original musical. She was joined in the show by the main cast of the show, as well as two guest star actors, as well as an opening cast of the film's cast, which was also featured in the original film. The film received its own DVD version on DVD back in 2014 by Universal Studios, which was also released in Europe on VHS and VHS-R.|0
This movie was obviously made with a very low budget , but did they have to make it so obvious to everybody that they were shooting in the same direction? So, if I understand this correctly, they could have used a low budget, or maybe a hard budget and just had the same effect, but I'm really not sure. So, what the hell is the difference between a low budget and a hard budget? It seems to me it is a bit more complicated than it is at first glance.|0
I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. I recently found The Prey in its original VHS 'big box' form and was very excited. I just LOVE finding old slasher films on VHS because the cover artwork is fantastic. Usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. The Prey is one of those films.To be fair, it started off OK, with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods.|1
Do n't get me wrong . I 've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band , so if it helps I'm sure you'd be willing to spend some time looking up the sources of his research. If you can help me figure out where the research has gone and how people have been using it on a large scale, it will help a lot. But I'm a huge fan of Band and I know that you've all heard it before. I think you're right about the way it's been done.|0
Hard to believe - but it is ! I should n't be surprised . Commercials try to show how unique their product is! But you will get a bad impression about the quality! The quality doesn't change with the price. I think we all know that we need to get a new product. However, many of us would say that we don't know what the quality of the product we're selling will be! I'm not saying we don't love the product, or the price! I'm saying it's because we have used it for a while now.|0
"Lucio Fulci , a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety , ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in his late-1940s novel . 'I think of all the things that have happened so much before me in recent years . . . I suppose that you have to be very, very sorry.' Fulci’s father was a writer: ‘I do not think, and I don’t mean to be the worst person . . . but you are the worst!’

But the book’s success was a surprise, and Fulci said: ‘I had no intention to write another."|0
YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar (WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking.Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous.|1
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival ( World Premiere ) .A haunting , intimate portrait of an artist in his fifties and sixties, and of a man in his fifties , as the man in a fiftieth and fiftie years.It's one of the few films made at this time that the man in the film seems to be an outsider, a man who's taken a step forward in the world, but who just keeps going back and forth between an artist of his era and a man from that era who's left a mark on the art of today .|0
I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I persevered through to the end... However, this is not a programme I would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as I don't think it does the book justice, nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right. There was something about this adaptation that lacked believability - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and I found the acting to be, at times, poor.|1
My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store . From the cover it looked like she had just seen something from her father or someone from her school, but I didn’t see that much of it! She thought it was funny because it wasn’t just her father but also some of my other colleagues and my friends in the audience. The video has a very similar background, but is really about the father. I was curious how she was thinking. What was she thinking about?|0
"Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler (A real acting stretch...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network (Because wrestling sells!) however when Rip declines, the network gets a circuit fighting championship called (and i'm totally serious) ""Battle of the tough guys"" who's champion Zeus (Played by Tiny Lister Jr) maybe the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital."|1
"there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda,that story told about young writer who is seekin' his place after a second war(he's survive german camp).excellent true atmosphere(action goes in camp for displaced placed),main hero(played by one of the best polish actor daniel olbrychski) finally fall in love ,but unfortunately his lady has been killed .there was beautiful scene,when he is talking with american soldier and says (about death his girl)""nothing is happen,simply you're shootin' to us now... he's condition of soul has been destroyed."|1
This is one of the best action films I have seen. Geena's portrayal of the tough as nails, 'Charly'/gentle mother 'Sam', was superb and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you laughing all the way through, with his classic one liners. Sure, there were a few holes in the actual story, but this fast-paced flick keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam/Charly and her versatility as an actress is evident for her role as the mother in the recent movie 'Stuart Little'.|1
The minutiae of what 's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of the series. As it was initially announced that it had been carried out by an undercover cop, as it had been earlier, police had also been caught stealing a gun. On the other hand, it was reported that there were a number of items being taken at random in an alley near the murder scene, including one that had been picked up at a drug deal. The first item that was picked up was a car that was sitting in a storage shed.|0
I do not find this show at all funny. I actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible Disney channel sit-coms right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie, because she can't act. The jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and I mean little bit) of acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There both really stupid and just terrible actors.|1
"Watched this film at a local festival , the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film festival, it is a beautiful city and it's a great way to have an amazing festival experience . The event was very successful with a crowd of 5-10 people and a crowd of 6-8 and the atmosphere was just awesome. It was amazing to watch and have so much fun with it! It took about 45 seconds and I was like ""Wow, wow! You're so talented"" :-D. The screening was a great experience for me as the event was very intimate."|0
You know the old saw about a train wreck? The one about how you can't look away? This movie isn't that good. The only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap.Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.I didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit.|1
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life. To know that this film is based on a true story and watching Jeffrey Dahmer(Carl Crew) brutally murder his victims is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I admit this was a low budget film with not the best dialogue, however it explained why Jeffrey Dahmer was a Psycotic maniac. As he was so selfishly/inwardly emotional his emotions and selfishness went so far deep into his brain that it resulted into him becoming a murderer.|1
"I suppose I like this film as well as any I know ; it is not perfect , but under all conditions it is a good one. I'm a big fan of the film , but in any case I have never seen a film that is a good or bad movie for me. I would love a good or bad movie, if you want something better , then try this:

I am not saying this film is ""good"" for me but I have seen a lot of movies that are very good, however, the movie is too bad."|0
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard for learning these people, they 're life styles and pasts which support this.The two lead actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen. %100 believable, they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly, into their world. The actors' seamless acting teamed with Bechard's Beautiful, realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.This film is visual treat- soft ,increasing the intensity of The story.|1
This film could have been great- but wasn't. Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild inklings of talent. The main star of the film plays a good lead role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. It looks like Gay Porno. Fortunately no one stripped off. The rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish.|1
I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians.|1
"The title, although singular, will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of Tod Browning's immortal classic about a troop of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. I can assure you, however, that this ""thing"" has absolutely nothing to do with ""Freaks"" or even with the art of professional film-making in general. This movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it's raw, disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values. Yeah right The person who recommended it to me may now consider himself to be my personal foe!"|1
ALERT : This review contains major SPOILERS . Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from the review, there is one thing about the film: there is not much that goes on in the background of the movie, although it does appear to do its job. . . . The first scene is a scene where a car with a woman and the camera goes on an elevator and the elevator doors are closed. The next scene is the first scene that you see in this movie and you have a clear idea of what the car is doing.|0
This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and symbolism. It also highlights the role women have in other cultures to help them make their own way, in ways that few women have experienced yet. “I’m so lucky to have been given a chance at being able to express myself and to show others the way I know they should see me. My life is in a very emotional place, and I want to use that to help other women out.|0
I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget, arthouse movies. I also know that John Sayles has a sort of glow about him, that earthy, intellectual anti-hollywood vibe, a la Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, that makes him a darling with the critics from the get-go.But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it just isn't.It meanders. It has too many characters. Its tone is uneven, its point of view is muddled, the acting is all over the board, from naturalistic to over the top.|1
"My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it . That all ended seconds into the second episode, when it became clear what was about to come up for the final act, the death of his son and how the family of his daughter was trying to get him back together. But then the movie didn't end, it just continued to exist. It continued in the series through the entire first two episodes of the first series. ""So I was like, I was trying to figure out what happened."|0
So , this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see . It 's up there with `` Crossbones . It can 't even look good if you can see it. It is really good! I have never seen a movie that would 've done this . But it sure does look really good to me! Thank you for the link! I 'll get back to it as soon as I know the truth . I'll try it again in 5 months! I will look at it again in 10 months, I promise! Thanks for the link .|0
"Set in Venice mainly on the Lido , Visconti 's `` Death in Venice '' is a triumph of filmmaking. Dorothea E. Fennell has done some good things in the last 20 years. She's one of the most recognizable actresses in London and she's been a major part of the British movie scene for decades. ""When the first movie was released, she had a lot to learn and had a lot to provide."" She was married and they divorced in 1983, and she and her family moved away. They're now a couple."|0
Man , I never laugh so much this year , and it 's pretty hard to make me laugh . But I do laugh , and I want to know that I 've never laughed in one year .

I love his martial arts style , it is quick , close up and oh so fast , but it does not always happen . That said , when it comes to fighting styles, the bodywork is a lot more difficult to train in , and I wouldnt recommend the same for that . What I'd say is that for most fighters, the fighting style is most important , for me , as it is so important for my body to be as strong as possible as I do not like having my head up at the time .|0
I enjoyed it . There you go , I said it again . I even bought this movie on DVD and I had to give it back to you . It is really great . The movie looks like you would actually see it again . I was really excited to watch it . It was so good . The movie can be seen again ! I watched it now , I am going to start my movie now and watch it now and see the movie . It was pretty good , I will be back for the movie soon .|0
Well , I 've just seen Buster Keaton 's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle 's The Butcher Boy and-despite the film, I couldn't wait to watch his first ever film debut. In my mind's eye-of-steel-fantasy-scenario-movie, Buster Keaton (played by Jason Statham) has only been able to score a handful of Oscar nominations before. (He also won an Academy Award last year for Best Actor.) To be fair, though, he does have another shot at a Oscar nomination for his best picture. And it seems that the Academy has done something very special about it.|0
I actually liked certain things about this game . I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had more story-driven gameplay, but the second person mode was a tad too much. There was a slight lack of balance between the story and the characters, which made it feel like there were more characters than the story. If I had my way, the game could have been better if the narrative was more involved and the gameplay was much more action-driven. This game is great. I love how it looks, sounds and sounds and it feels as good as the other games I've played this far.|0
"""River's Edge"" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and for a year that also saw ""Blue Velvet"", you know thats saying something. Viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated ""Kids"". The previews for ""Kids"" played it up to be an expose of the deterioration of the nation's youth. In reality, it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value. ""River's Edge"" was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in actuality much better."|1
"Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life? Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy, to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions, almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him. ""Trois couleurs: Rouge"" is based on the concept of ""UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD""."|1
Sorry about that . But if you have seen this `` epic '' , you will obviously know of the exact content of it, and your friends can probably find a way to do so. As an aside, some of this content may actually be in some kind of source, so you might be surprised to find it in a source other than this. And if you haven’t seen that, or if you think you may not care to look at it, or if you have seen some of the other sites that you might be interested in finding, then you would be asking too many questions.|0
"This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the ""gray"" characters turn ""good"" and the ""bad"" guys get their just desserts and *boom* ... it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up.Which wouldn't have been so bad ... if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place."|1
imagination must of slipped Jim Wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one . i do n't mind the way he said it. I'm in a terrible state of grief. It's a little strange that I'm not getting back to it. I was just about to ask Jim for help if I couldn't find a reason for this. If I do, he's gone. I'm sorry. And I do, too. I don't know that he's going to go, but it seems like he's not going to leave, I'm afraid.|0
"Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever, free-spirited, and ""heavy on the bottle"" retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters)."|1
This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s. Otto Preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank going cold turkey, this is a riveting movie! With Kim Novak (giving a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptilian pusher and Arnold Stang as Frank's grifter pal.|1
I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan. If you have not seen a David Cronenberg film then this is not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work up to Videodrome before checking this one out. This is certainly one of his best and takes the interactive game phenomena one step beyond.In this game the players plug a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted into their spinal cord and get into the game directly through their nervous system.|1
"I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes ""Legally blonde"" look like ""The Usual Suspects"" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie."|1
This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years . It's probably been my favorite movie to be watched by a child since I was a boy (and have seen countless other movies about them) . I've seen other movies of other children, for instance , but I have never ever seen anything about a child that was so weird. The film does so much better, I don't remember the first time I looked, but the film is very well done, and I'm very fond of the characters.|0
i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen . 219 minutes passed and yet I waited to see my father's voice on the phone. I said a few words to him and told him that if he didn't show up quickly I would go home. He thanked me for not waiting and then he hung up the phone and said that it was best to leave the house as he always does for me and my father and that he would see me. He was right about that.|0
This is the best work i have ever seen on television . The story is compelling -- all the more so on the side of the audience. There are many things that the audience may have to get used to, but this one will do it for the money. The ending is just right, if you listen to the story. We’re talking about the story itself. But it is not over -- this is actually the end. As I said, there are other things you need to get used to -- such as the story itself, which I think has become a lot easier on your brain.|0
"A scientist (George Zucco) wants to create wolf men out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis, but is branded as mad. He uses a simpleton gardener (Glenn Strange) to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. Strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Of Mice and Men"", has no idea what's going on, only that he sleepwalks. The victims begin to pile up (including a little girl, which modern viewers might find rather disturbing, and two of Zucco's rivals)."|1
"Watched the director's cut last night...glad it was free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at ""film noir"". The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, not clever, seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. The ""non-traditional"" casting I also found distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder ""what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there?"" then the storyteller has failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating, and very film school final project-ish."|1
Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making , it 's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.If you don't like the visual quality, you shouldn't make this film, unless it's something truly spectacular, or something the film should have a little bit of drama or a good bit of humour, as you may want to put on your best suit, but for whatever reason that makes you think you can't find it at all, which is just one of the things that makes it so great.|0
"I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera. I think it's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian movie ""City of God"", but maybe this parallelism between the two tracks possible to follow (crime and art) in social neighborhood are a reality. I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I don't think it's unreal that he shoot such good films, because there's a lot of artists that don't have any type of education and can be really genius. I enjoyed very much the soundtrack."|1
Love this little film , that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem , SHALL WE DANCE ? (and the movie is not) .

This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie 's work , a lifeless , muddled mystery that, with the assistance of the film crew , was able to put the film together in just six minutes! If you're not familiar, a movie is made up of a film made for one purpose and for another purpose. One of the main functions in making such an film is, at least in the context of the character, the main thing that makes this film unique from other movies in the history of film production is its ability to tell the most important story about the world's inhabitants.|0
"It 's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is the only way to achieve their dream of becoming a human."" I don't see why it couldn't be easier. ""It's just that I know people who don't feel the same way about being a woman - they just have different ideas about that, and it's easy to see how difficult it may be for some of those who have made the dream of becoming a man and not being able to do the work that they've been doing for the last five years to be successful."|0
"After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers , the agent Sonni Griffith (1875-1944), who served as an inspector and who is also known as the ""Duke of Batai"" for his activities in Romania, is accused and charged for the murder of a Romanian woman who was found dead in the Romanian countryside. According to the criminal investigation, Griffith and the Dukes of Batai have been members of a criminal syndicate known as The Mafia. They were allegedly working for a Romanian government organization, which in reality was just a gang of individuals."|0
Excellence seems to come rare in Hollwood today. Many consider just two out of the year's best picture nominees to display sense to the movie industry. And in 'Everything is Illuminated,' the mark is hit directly.The film initiates its brilliance with the beautiful setting-the-scene entry. From the beginning, you receive a sense of warmth and true family connections and relations between one and another. And also, the cast is introduced perfectly. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensibility is expressed through holding his dying grandmother's hand.|1
Although it is n't mentioned very often , `` Do n't Look in the Basement '' is a very interesting concept to use. It may even be a good idea to look it up in the Basement at all times. But even if you dont see the Basement, you still see that it wasnt there before! It is just a matter of time. But it is still important that when you see a Basement , you will see it as well. You will also find it very useful to keep it from showing up in theBasement.|0
"I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is, without a doubt, a must see, a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. ""Charlie Don't Surf""."|1
I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap, thinking it would be a typical, crap straight-to-video monster junk, but it turned out much better than expected. There isn't really any criticism to say about it... it's obviously low budget, but that just adds to the cheesy old fashioned fun. It's very cool and entertaining.There's everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. And I'd say it's pretty original, cuz it really doesn't come off as any other movie I've seen.|1
The cinematography is the film's shining feature. Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. I hope there's a Blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. It's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless, has incredible strength, and is vulnerable to sunlight.|1
Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the most powerful of them all. ‘Black Envy’ has never been released in all of its many forms so there is no doubt in my mind it will be the first black exploit flick to come along. The film, released in November 2012 with a budget of over £400 million, is based upon the novel by Robert Benchley which was originally published in 2012. The film was originally slated for a film-length release on 27 June 2015, but it did not materialize.|0
Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible movie by Mr. Boll. How he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community.As a whole I will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts. Some of the dialog was even half way decent in Far Cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly.Now besides the fact that Jack Carver is supposed to be American and not German, Til was still entertaining in this role.|1
"In ""Red Letters"", Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. There are two reasons to watch this flick...Kinski is one and Piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. Everything is wrong with ""Red Letters""...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time."|1
I love dissing this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's some huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it.|1
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first ( and probably the only) people I met during my time of life in England. I can’t express how sorry I am, or why I ever wanted to leave the country with you. I know I had to hide in my apartment for days at a time, but as of this writing, I have finally found out how you were, and what you did. It doesn’t seem to help at all. I’ll see if I can get someone to talk to you.|0
"oh well... its funny. should have been a sadistic comedy, a lot of horror movies lack common sense,but i think a retarded caveman would weasel his way around this situation. Don't really expect Hitchcock or anything close to this. this is a good one for friends,but i wouldn't recommend it for anything else.this movie lacks all the substance of a true horror movie,the suspense,the shock,and good characters. the killer failed to be the unstoppable force that i expected him to be,and he seemed to be the average angry ""D"" student able to outsmart only stupid people."|1
Reba is a very dumb show. You can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like she's not even a character. A show like this should at least have SOMEONE who resembles a real-life person. I guess Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever her name is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! That's my opinion on Reba.|1
When the Legends Die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become Tom Black Bull, a champion bronc rider. Raised in the old ways, Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. Bitter about the role he has been forced into, Tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager.|1
"I'm going to recommend putting this one in the ""skip it"" pile as well. I was mildly excited by the concept when my fiancée rented it, and a bit more excited when I saw that Milos Forman directed it. Ah, well.....The costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the Period Costume department of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, British and French - everyone dressed like they were at court in Versailles."|1
"One of the problems with popular culture , especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s , is that there are many instances where a story or a story is the only one being told , which means that there are some who are unaware of it but who know the stories themselves. For example:
One of the most important stories that a user of the site often gets is ‘How many of you have seen in the last six months’, which is not quite accurate but the average of the users is about 1/4,000 of a third of a thousand."|0
While out divining for water, a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney) stumbles upon something else altogether. She discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her aunt's ranch. Instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for, the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, a devil worshiper who was beheaded by Sir Francis Drake. Telepathically controlling the hired-hand who opened the chest, Drew's head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body  also buried on Jessica's aunt's farm.|1
This production of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen . Although it does take a while for production to come back to the same level, the production itself is really the difference. The first couple of scenes are really amazing . For instance, at one point the scenes from the first scene is absolutely breathtaking . For this I was a bit worried about it, because I was watching a trailer, but when I got to the first scene that I wanted to do I realised it wasn't worth that much to watch.|0
I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie . I think I will never forgive myself for it and I will NEVER do anything like that again . I will never forget this movie , I will never go back with that again . I wish it was as good as it gets . I was thinking about it for about the first 2 hours of it because I thought I was in love, I was in love, I was going to go home, and I wanted to go home and be with me in a different way.|0
`` De Dominee '' is based on the life of a real dutch gangster , Klaas Bruinsma ! In the early 1970s, De Dominee was playing with the Bruins, and he became a part of the team. In 1979, he won the American Hockey League Rookie of the Year award for the team. The Bruins won the American Hockey League Championship series and the American League Championship Series. In 1994, De Dominee won a gold medal at the Canadian Tire Hockey Tournament in Toronto, but the team finished the season losing the title to the Bruins.|0
The core issues at play (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be & should be tremendously compelling (as demonstrated through thousands of works of art/music/literature/film). End of Days, unfortunately, is nothing but a 2Dimensional Cartoon. Byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.The single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes, the seductive power of evil.|1
The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of wanting him to do what he does. If you ask me, there are some people in this world with the idea of a Mafia life. This is why you might ask why they would do this. They are in a Mafia prison. They just want to get their lives back on track. It is not hard to find people who think it is possible for someone to be the only person in this world with a mob mentality.|0
It looked cool from the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest. The film quality was poor, and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the drunkest person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film. May god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new one and only reason why I never will want to see (or trust) an Australian made film again.|1
This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos. It is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing, embedded in the marvellous array of characters, a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score, and witty, light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch over and over. Montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante's home to discover the identity of her former beau, a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather preposterous, the results are hilarious.|1
What a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this . Folks, it's only a couple of ratings and it's not my fault. I would have to say, I think there's some reason for the 2.1 rating, but I won't make the mistake of thinking that IMDb isn't correct. And, again, IMDb is, in my view, the most comprehensive of any rating. It's not easy to compare a lot of things because they're not easy to measure because they have many, many values.|0
THANK GOD YOU 'RE HERE is painful , positively painful . The title is apt , in a sense , but there is much less to do . It can simply be, if it was a matter of a moment in your life as a person you would have lived it differently than you would have lived on the inside . . , it can simply be a matter of a moment . . . It 's the end . . . you can 't be in a hurry. . . . But what is a man going through in that time and place?|0
"This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and acting is not. I actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before I was so bored with it I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a bore from beginning to, well 54 minutes into the film anyway. The premise of ""Guess what happened to me on the way to the ...."" has been done over and over to death."|1
"I love this movie. Yes, the main character lies, but that's why it's called ""big fat liar"". Even though this kid runs away to Hollywood, it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. Besides, he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything, he does it to regain trust. I don't think it was just one big ad for Universal Studios, because I liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is."|1
A tedious effort from not-yet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress Nina Foch , this movie was meant for the general reader and that is why it’s here. The movie is an attempt to make sense out of the world we have come to know. A good movie and I would really recommend it if you want to learn how to make a decent movie with a nice cast but I have to say that the movie does not have a very good cast or a bad cast but it does feel like a very good movie in my opinion.|0
I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears. I guess I just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. It was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with Greer was endearing. There wasn't any of that here. When Greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged.|1
Oh boy. Films like this really bother me. If this movie is supposed to close to truth, then I assume that Rommel knew Hitler for a time before WWII started. In the movie, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed from before. Well I can't imagine that Rommel wouldn't have known something about Hitler's government policies so Rommel must share some guilt for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life at the end a tragic one. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him?|1
Wow, did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, Abraham Lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the Enterprise!!!!!!! Is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! Lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. Abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. It seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle it out for supremacy.|1
This movie doesn't have any pretense at being great art, which is good. But it is a well written script with well developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it I could do without the drama surrounding the wife, but it wasn't distracting enough to detract from the main story concerning Minnie Driver's character. I think that all too often Hollywood abandons an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama when, with an adult themed movie such as this, the emotional type of drama is all that's really needed - and probably more believable too.|1
I found this movie to be a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not believable, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. The only part of the film I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed. The special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies. A typical unimaginative slasher flick.It's hard to believe, make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy, noisy idiots.|1
I'm a Christian, and I have watched pretty of Christian movies, but this one is too bad. They try to make this good, but it's too hard for them I think.- You can see the film is badly dubbed in many places. - You can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind. I think there will be a lot more of them.- The quality is poor, and the acting could have been better too. The story is not so very bad, but could've been better.|1
I don't understand why this movie was released, it looked like something that you show your mates after you borrowed your mums handycam she bought in 1987. I am Australian and work for a video store in the UK and thought that if an Aussie film made it into our store it can't be all bad... boy was I wrong!If anyone writes a good comment about this movie they are either lying or the makers of the film.The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh the acting, it was the WORST acting in the HISTORY OF FILM.|1
"Down Periscope is not a ""Great Movie"". But then again very few flicks are. So if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a ""great movie"", without the capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine. They are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. They must take on the entire US-navy with it's nuclear submarines. But they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome."|1
It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor. He shines in this film as the near-40-year-old image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner child--until he meets him face to face. This is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the WHOLE family. It is about caring for each other, keeping some of the child inside you, and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would.|1
"* * * MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * * * * I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate! I had a great time doing that, because, well, it was amazing! I was able to see all of the stars that are out there, and then I was like, ""That's cool! He's just a great guy."" And then I saw this guy who was kind of out of this world, and he was like, ""Oh, right, that's great. It's amazing!"|0
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, I was struck by the fact that as the film’s trailer started to roll I couldn’t make the decision for me to leave the cinema. After watching the trailer for the first and second screening at my local cinema, I knew the decision was mine. I wanted to be transported to another world. I wanted to get into another film, and if I was allowed to come into this one I would enjoy it.|0
* * * SPOILERS * * * This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is quite possibly the best you've seen! I had a very good time as a kid with my kids and they were such a happy family - it would probably have been easier for me to go to them than to watch them. However, I was also a bit sad about it at first and I did want to share the story of how it turned out. Now that we've seen it, it's time to do the rest of the scenes!|0
"Donald Sutherland , an American paleontologist visiting England , picks up a hitch hiker one evening . Two years later, Sutherland finds that this is not the case. “You can’t put it into words. Maybe it’s not worth the paper that it’s written. But it’s worth the paper.”

A few days later and he’s left the hotel, which is in an old house in Manchester. A few months ago, he was visiting with his wife, and he has now left for London."|0
I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $5.50, so I thought I would take another look. Total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations repeated them for many years.Better than I expected actually, time has been kind to the obvious sincerity of it's creators, and to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all the Allied fighting men and women.|1
Yes , I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill ! Julie was born in 1972 , and has an older son. She is an author , and we met at a birthday party where the kids were all having fun together. We were very happy to hear that her son is also an avid reader, she is now a teacher, and has had the privilege of teaching classes to her son in her spare time. She loves to play in a musical and I loved her enthusiasm for the sound of that particular sound.|0
The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you-it is not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! to The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex jokes, would be the funniest thing since Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slipshod job, you'd thought it was written in a week. I have found it that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good.|1
I caught this on HBO under its category of `` Guilty Pleasures '' , and I would agree that I was a little biased, as I felt that it was better to avoid guilt than risk of getting into a situation which might result in an arrest. I also liked the way it dealt with drugs, but I would also find that in a situation where I didn't have to take a lot of drugs, I didn't want to have to use drugs again, which was not a problem in my case.|0
In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple. Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper, or Bobby Heenan's cronies or Ted DiBiase and come out victorious more often than not. Occasionally he would get an ally like Randy Savage in 1988, but mostly it was all about Hulk Hogan vs Bobby Heenan, and that's the way it should be.But on this night that was about to change, a new champion, a man who the WWE thought would be their man for the 90s was crowned. It didn't work out.|1
There is a solid group of people that have lives like this girl going through the admissions process at school. All they can do is write her name, address, name, phone number, date of birth and some name. The rest of the school doesn’t even know the full details of what she’s been doing – it just doesn’t know her name. She just thinks she’s at risk. And they are the only people that have a clue about the identity of her student. This is the second book I’m reading that is going to make her a better teacher.|0
RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. TCM aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of Joan Fontaine.Fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is okay as her love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine.|1
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. It's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. Still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.|1
This `` film , '' and I use that term loosely , reminds me of the first joke my daughter and I got, in one night . '' And you have seen the first part of it in the film, so you get a sense of it. In the second part we're watching the scene, when the car is being pulled out of the back of the truck. We see the driver's car being pulled over by a drunk driver and it turns into a car pulling over. And then one of the cops pulls over and they drive off in their own car .|0
This really is a cringe making exercise . Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes . Dressed in this way is the best part of the whole story . I can tell you that this isn’t just a matter of making a great film about a guy who just wants to die. I don’t think it matters, but I can see the danger when you look into it. First of all I want to tell you a few points that you should keep in mind for the sake of the movie.|0
It may be, although there are still two or three I've missed. This film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, Kafka-esque characters. Into their midst, the movie drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? I suppose I would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it's not.|1
"I usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones.Unfortunately this movie is one where I fail miserably-and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many IMDb reviewers share my pain.I don't usually watch sequels but I just had to see this since I love ""Rosemary's Baby"" so much. What a mistake that was. It simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy-though thankfully, very few are as bad as this. In fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be."|1
This was a great movie , I would compare it to the movie The Game . You get to the end of the movie, there are some good things in it, not sure why they would be the same in different movies. The movie makes it look like the movie was made by Michael Jackson , we will see some of the better parts of the movie , it looks good and looks like a movie from Michael Jackson . The best part is that there is more in the film , I am really liking the way it plays .|0
This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life . It is a complete waste of money and time to make one movie that could have been the best of the best, and it just doesn't work out. We are in this together and we cannot afford to make another movie. This is the best thing I have ever done . I have made some great movies in the past and they were just wonderful. I was not going to pay for something that I had already made . All I could do was watch this movie and make some great movies for the next 30 years.|0
"I am sure I 'm in the minority ( I know I am among my friends ) , but I think you should read up on what we do here in general

I have been reading the posts on reddit, I've been browsing the various other threads and found a lot about the various topics discussed in the article. I don't understand what is going on here, but you should read it if you are interested in more about the subjects and the topic.

I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome . I am not an expert in the movie, only in the movie. I’ve been playing it for a couple of years. I have never played it, but I was in it recently. I’ve played it for the past three or more years and am very good at that. That was my first experience of it. So I am playing it now . It’ll be fun to watch it, and if you like the movies you can watch it on Netflix , so that’s an offer I can give.|0
Having worked professionally with young girls on the run , I found this film surprisingly authentic . I would never have seen such a spectacular film if I'd never heard of it . I have seen a lot of amazing work . If you would like to get in the habit of visiting this website, please head over to the About page of this site, and you will be taken on a visit to the DVD. I would love to see more of your art . If you have an artist's website you can visit there.|0
This show is terrible . I can not get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains . So, I decided to try something new and I can not find it anywhere . But I had a bit of an urge to search it . I am really sorry to lose this show . But, I didn't have much luck but I really need to try . I think I have lost some of it . I want to put it to good use . I have no reason to not show this series to anyone . But, I hope to see you .|0
As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy 's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I think I can say it's an amazing achievement. I can say that this book is a great example of how art can really be done. You get to read everything and you get to get to feel the work you have done. The story is interesting, the story is amazing, but the style of the story was great. The illustrations weren't really big, the style was not so big. And there is a few things that just make it better.|0
Oh yes, I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash. I can't say I was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head, tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on. No I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the fact here folks. - The acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous.|1
The most vivid portrait of small-town oddity I 've seen in a long time -and I 'm not just talking about that! And what I think you should do to find a job in the City of London to do some of the work I am currently doing that I was interested in doing. Last I checked - I am not working on the same level of production as my co-workers but I know that it takes a while to find a job to do a job in the City of London. I've talked about this in the last few months but not in the context of doing work for my co-workers.|0
I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who actually care about each other. They may have faults, but bitterness and put-downs have no place with these girls. Try to find that on TV or in the usual movies. It is a breath of fresh air to see girls being feminine--wearing beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Contrast that with the apparel in stores today, i.e. raggedy and faded jeans and jackets, etc. The story line has an evil thread running through but that is what makes it more realistic and interesting.|1
If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you , if you like your films with a focus on what you really need to do and what you should be doing in order to do it for a film , then you are in the right place. We have already discussed the different ways you could use your films. We are not going to be talking about one of the most important aspects of filmmaking and what makes us successful at it, but what we are going to do here is discuss these and the ways you can use your movies to your advantage.|0
This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art. This is an oblivious labour of love by the Schrader brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima that is full truly artistic elements. The movie jumps from color to black and white, past to present, fictional works by Mishima to him. All without being confusing in the least bit. The only thing that gets me is that the entire movie, with the exception of the narrator's spoken parts is in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience but hasn't found won.|1
To date this is still the worst piece of rubbish I 've ever viewed . So annoyed I even complained, but I never thought I'd get it , even after looking up the book, but I've never seen this book in person . I have a copy of it in my library , and I've been going there more and more . But it's hard to believe if you watch the movie , it actually happens to be my favourite, but that is only the best example , I'm afraid . What's so hard for you to believe?? .|0
What a crappy movie! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in Canada, yet he had a thicker Indian accent than his parents! Is it just me or does Uday look gay in this movie? Also, do all the chicks in Canada dress like sluts? At least that's how it is in this movie. All the females are dressed like strippers. Don't waste your time with this one! The only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful Vancouver. Wonder why Bollywood is going through a slump?|1
"Yes, indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie!The only reason I chose to vote a 10 for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad-made that it actually becomes funny. ""Night Hunter"" is basically about Jack Cutter, a Vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries, apparently), and his mission, being that he has to kill the last remaining Vampires.This movie contains one of the cheesiest scenes I have ever seen in my life. Not to mention the really bad gun-shooting scenes."|1
This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco . It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners , who may just have been watching the trailer . It is a well thought out and highly thought out movie . This is one of those movies with very nice plot lines , but it’s not a really funny movie. It’s quite a funny movie . But then you can see some of the jokes and scenes , and the actors will be really interesting to watch. And I think the best part of it was that it was written by the director.|0
A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island . They are then captured by an insane count who finds them on a tiny island . The islander then tries to steal their clothing from the beach . The ship-wrecked crew tries to escape . They get caught in a deep sea and try to join the party . In a few minutes, their boat is engulfed by waves . A man, who had never seen anything like that before , has been captured . After several days they are rescued and brought back to their home . The islanders are reunited with their family .|0
Okay they tell you it's real. They don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - It's not real in the way you were hoping for. The speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). To me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). Therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage.|1
This film is so 1980's and that is what I like so much about it. It does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade. The reality that Russian nukes could wipe you out at any time. Reagan in the White House telling everybody that things were great, while more and more social programs were slashed. Young people dropped out, but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did. Young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their sensetivities were all but dead.|1
First - nick-623 , Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941 , not 1942 . They did n't have to predict it would happen again, just as we did the first time we did . We knew the worst was likely to happen the next thing , and we all knew the worst was going to come . There was no way to get back, and so we didn't really think we needed to worry . They were going to do something we hadn't thought of before , we didn't have a sense of what to do , but we didn't really have a choice , so we waited .|0
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 & 3), this is fast-paced, in your face, rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses. Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases, with the capable assistant of his boss, Capt. Ed Hocken.The story lines are spurious, at best, but it's deliberate, as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling, but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters.|1
there is one of the best movies directed by andrzej wajda , that story told about young writer who is in trouble and who goes to see his friend , who comes back and says that he has made up his mind, because the man has lost his friend , and he has lost his wife , but the other two characters have found a way to make peace , to take the fight of their lives and make the right kind of life for themselves and their friends. As this story was told, they have lost their wife , to come back and bring her back.|0
Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College, and judging from the enthusiastic response, he has much to be pleased about. A taught, well done Indy, impressive for it's big budget look and feel. This movie has it all: a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending. This viewer didn't see it coming! Excellent performances all around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were were especially well cast in the leads, delivering strong performances. And kudos to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film.|1
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival . Rupert Grint shows he can act very quickly, which makes it an important point that he can do things quickly. On this show we’re all familiar with driving lessons and there’s so much to do with us, and it’s a very fun experience to see what other people are going through . We’d like to thank everyone who has been a part of our journey and to everyone who got to experience it at the Tribeca film festival .|0
"Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.I still think Martin Sheen got ""dissed"" big-time in the billing, too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours, 17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?Sheen is fantastic in here, especially his narration, which runs throughout."|1
When I first heard about `` Greek , '' I figured I would watch it because it sounded ridiculous . I wanted to make sure the voice was good and it made me feel good. I wanted to make sure it was fun to watch, so I did a little time for it and took a look at the list of ``Greek'' sounds. I had a great time watching Greek, but that did not mean that it wasn't fun to listen to. When I listened to the video of ''Greek'' it seemed as if he was talking to you.|0
At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner ' .. a really cool movie. You can see it on youtube. This is the first video in the trilogy to be released. We are going to talk a little about what was in the film and what this trilogy was like. But first let me add what's new to me here. In the movie the main character from the first movie was killed. What did you think it was? First I'm going to go through the main character's name.|0
"""Strangers on a Train"" was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and, as always with any Hitchcock movie, it not only stood up to the test of time, it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's ""Speed."""|1
Bad , bad , and did I mention bad ? Aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest thing I’ve read in recent memory is how stupid they are to think about the economy. There are a lot of people out there, that just like you, have been saying they don’t know what to believe. I hope you’re right. I hope you don’t give in to this kind of nonsense, but you might be a bit too upset. So what’s the point of your comments?|0
A very , very , very slow-moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man . Not sure how to write it, I hope you will help me put that together for you , and hopefully for a long time !!! I will write your movie in about 20 minutes I can post here. Good luck to you for your help! Thanks for the opportunity. It was really nice of you to help me with this and make me feel really comfortable in my new job. Hope your movie would make a big impact on your life.|0
"This is one awful movie ! ! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I don't have much memory of what it actually is. On the contrary, it is a really great movie that can be viewed. I am not going to spoil this movie for anybody and I am going to keep it up for those people who don't have the time to watch it :-(

So here is one bad movie and I hope that you will like it :-P

A:

If you read the first sentence, you'll see it's a terrible movie."|0
"Well, after seeing ""Beginning"" I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor one. But now, after seeing ""Dominion"" I deeply understand this decision. Even they got it not much better.Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes are killing this movie.I thing the Exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see. But there is so much little of it in the movie."|1
A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie , but I feel this is not true. It was actually based on a film I had written years ago and I didn't know what was going on. In reality, it's a baseball movie based on the same premise as the movie itself but made from the original story. Even though I can't say if this was the original movie or not. For the record, for the film to really make sense is a movie that would probably just have made a very boring movie at the box office.|0
The movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest . The movie had nothing exiting its box. The movie does not have a title of its own, nor does it feature a person in it. The only part to have any interest to have in the movie is the title, but there is nothing about the title that gives any interest to it. The movie has nothing to hold it to, and it is the only way to get to that point of interest. It has nothing to hold a person to it. It has nothing to be in it.|0
If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would. I was stupid enough to pick this DVD up in the shop, read the blurb and think, that sounds quite good, I'll spend £10 and buy it. all I got at the end of it was a £10 coaster. Absolutely awful, I don't even know where to begin. I have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because I can't think of one good thing to say about it.|1
"Now here is a movie that does something that has n't been done in a long time . It take 2 hours and 30 mins to make this movie. So it's not for a long time but now it's time to show it to everyone. 1

"A lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple.Then there's Linda Blair. ""The Exorcist"". That's it.When you see ""Chained Heat"" and watch Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was running through her mind.Certainly not, ""Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come! ""Just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s, this one actually has names you may recognize."|1
"Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's Bend due to encountering the Krites, Brad Brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for Easter. Meanwhile the Krite eggs begin to hatch. As they cause trouble in the town, Brown & the townsfolk, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town.The original Critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick ""Gremlins"". It became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel."|1
Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction.|1
"I saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote ""i also expected a Steven movie"", god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. In had a little doubts cause i read that ""Ja Rule"" was playing in it, but i thought hopefully they give him a smal role, so i don't get irritations by watching him. And offcourse the opposite happend, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a sry *** crew like this. Steven was broke and needed cash?"|1
Chris Morris' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints, both from the audience and from the people taking part. But, nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived, the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program!|1
This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War--most likely in anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. In the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic. It also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary, BIRTH OF A NATION--a patently absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer.|1
"""Lets swap Murders- your wife, my father""- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respectable tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, the flirtatious Miriam, won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne, laughs the whole conversation off as a joke. The following week he isn't laughing any more. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense, Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her."|1
Seriously , Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies . They 're all horrible . And this one had John Rhys-Davies on it . But this one did, too . . . because the first one was actually very funny . . . Because it really did do the opposite of a good movie . I mean I don't think it would have done that . . I know the first one's a little funny because the first one is really funny and then the last one was really fun . . . and it really did do that . . You've seen it before . .|0
This movie is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mom thought it's not polite to laugh when people are dying, but in this movie, even death looks ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into one tornado.Explosions of cars thrown onto buildings by the forces of wind look like ones from the old school side scroller game called R-Type. Dialogues are very bad and I am interested how they managed to persuade some of the actors to play in this movie.|1
"Back in August, '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like ""Urban Cowboy"", ""Every Which Way But Loose"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same ""Urban Cowboy"" crowd. Instead ""Honky Tonk Freeway"" bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title."|1
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or dead. In other words, they feel that they may not ever be the last. But one of the problems of the mourning songs is that the song is not heard for the moment when they are in mourning. A person might feel that the song was meant to be sung to a loved one, and that they were meant to be heard. So when someone is in love with you and/or wants you to share your story, it is important that they hear it.|0
This is a very, very odd film...one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself. The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance. Additionally, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.Later in the film, he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head.|1
*Minor spoilers* I just wanted to say that for anyone who likes entertaining baseball films, this is definitely in my top three. Only Little Big League and Major League can compete with this one in my mind. I would also like to commend the writers of this film for creating such enjoyable dialogue!! Without being too specific, I would say that the lines are very fitting for each character. Tom Selleck seemed to have no problem creating a realistic character as a ballplayer. His animosity towards playing overseas in Japan sets the tone for comical, yet meaningful interactions with his new team, the Dragons.|1
"Awful in a whole new way, ANYTHING BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs--if only as a cautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a ""vanity"" production. I am guessing a vanity production, since there is no other reason on god's green earth to cast as talent-free and not particularly attractive non-singer/actress as Isabel Gold in the leading lady role--vied for yet by the likes of ""lookers"" like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy--except that she also helped write this bizarre little movie."|1
This series is formulaic and boring . The episodes are the same thing every week , simply with slightly varied elements . For example, the characters are drawn from the anime . It's a little bit like a game , but with an actual game . I'll show you one more time how the characters work. There are so many more things to do! If you don't want to know about them, then just watch the anime episodes on youtube and they will tell you everything! So if you are interested to know more, this is what I have written!|0
"The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French ""Emmanuelle 2."" This amazing woman did not go unnoticed, and was soon cast as the lead in this all new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan/Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. Much like Sylvia Kristels character, Emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality."|1
Okay , it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke ( when the dead are rising from their tombs , the names of the most famous people have been omitted ). I love it and have always loved it! What do you think, you may like? I have been thinking about it for a few days, so have a great time. If you are interested, I can send it to one of your friends who is also interested, but have no idea where they will be next. Thanks again! My friend, who is also a professional photographer, is excited to share this with us!|0
I went to see this because I 'd never seen Tel-Aviv , where the story is set . I was looking for an Englishman to join me on an adventure and found myself in the process. I know that was a bad choice but I thought it had the potential to have something interesting to say. He did, but he wasn't sure if I would get an Englishman to join me on an adventure. Luckily, that turned out to be a blessing in disguise , so I started looking for the Englishman to join.|0
"Mute Witness is a modest , yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserved, even for some of its main characters. There are a ton of funny characters, but none of the ones that have actually made it out to be the ""perfect"" read, so you'll need to read the book to understand what the plot is all about. First, let's review some of what you're going to get. This is a really well-written book, if there ever was one."|0
An absolute classic of 80's scare flix. This one isn't like any other as it pits pint-size, wild-eyed, psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town. Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80's gold again) plays one of the killer-kids and he's paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots.|1
Dear reader, Watch out! This movie is not really a movie, though its creators have the impertinence to call it so. If you have not been warned about its content, here it goes: the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling, concept. They could be called, therefore, symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well. However, the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an American audience, because they are, in an overwhelming number, American icons.|1
I found the Movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the film the actors were great. It was entertainment. Benny the uncle was wonderful He was real at his character. The ending took a wonderful twist. I would recommend you seeing it. Eddie Mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail. I also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol.|1
I can only think of one reason this movie was released . To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Debord, the title character of this episode is Guy Debord. He is an avid gamer, a member of Team Guy (a.k.a. Robot Games) and one of the most successful video game characters on the planet. He’s the lead character in the series. In episode 2, Guy debonds the Robot Games team, along with a team of former teammates. Guy and Robot go to a local store and he’s quickly transported to the store where the game’s merchandise is on sale.|0
Well , I 've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it 's still almost as interesting as the last one, and I'm sure that you can't compare it against the movie, but still I 'm glad to see the movie here, even if its still a tad bit of a disappointment and I 'm sure there 's also a lot I could do with other movies I've seen, but I 'm hoping that you'll see this movie again if there's any chance of it being available somewhere.|0
As a fan of C.J . 's earlier movie , Latter Days , I really wanted to like this film.The story was about a young man and his grandmother, who were killed in the house of a woman they met after their parents died, after which he decides to marry them . It is also an important film about the romance of this young man and his mother that will be very important to the story of Latter Days . Latter Days has been an important movie for me. I am just glad that I did like this film. I want to know more about the movie.|0
Solomon and Sheba has come down in Hollywood lore not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died while making it. I was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was then, but I learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work.I often wonder if Ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved. He was the unnamed producer of this as well. Maybe he just didn't want to face the critics.|1
Where do I begin? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the DVD -- my wife and I watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. I can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. It's worth hearing.I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time around Memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. This film almost smells of the South, it's so real.|1
The film is a joy to watch , not just for the plot , which is gripping , but also because this is the only thing that is so important for our lives that we don't need to be scared of it . It's a story that is very powerful and unique , and we've never seen it . It's our story , the biggest story in our story , and it really gets us excited about the movie , so it is something we want to do , and it's also an interesting story that you've never seen.|0
Having lived in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula ( 30 miles from Escanaba ) in the mid-1990s , I was eager to see what would be his future, which included a job and an income of $30,000 a year on his own. In 2004, I interviewed with an executive in his department who wanted to create a business-friendly office. I was impressed that he had the resources and a strong business background, so we hired him and our team of developers and designers. He was eager to see the possibilities, which I found exciting to me.|0
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. One knows it's going to about a mute, one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.Well, forget it. The movie starts with a little black humour, and then gets started. From then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of Moscow. All right, it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected, and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder.|1
Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable, putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study.Scientist Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying. After success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans-violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility-with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastical.|1
The animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. After having watched Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse. But they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me.Otherwise, the film was just sort of interesting. I always like hearing the silly voice-overs. They never sound like what you think the actor/actress would sound like in real life. I liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. The shots of weird looking bugs were cool too.|1
"Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA . No guesswork here . A giant CGI studio crew with a very very small budget set to produce . ""What the hell is he doing?"" one of his friends asked. The answer came in response to what Wynorski had just been saying:

""If I say that, it's not the answer,"" he added. The question continued, ""What I have told you is that we do not want him in the studio. I have told you this before."""|0
Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. There have been rumors of new and improved versions of ‘Arabic Night’, which was the biggest and best-selling novel of the 1990s. It was also widely used as the soundtrack for songs by Al-Majestowni and many other contemporary artists. I was very happy to see the new version of the classic Arabian Nights movie. ‘Fahr al-Sufi’ was the most beautiful film of the 1980s but it is now in the very top of my list for best movie in history.|0
This film's a big bore. It has a plenty of Predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. It starts good with a classy number but seems lost midway.Surya & Jyothika's on screen chemistry works out really good & a good part by Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? He disappears totally after a good half an hour!. Santhanam proves his wit again by timing comedy.AR's tunes sure will last for sometime. But he could have done better. What ever be the drawbacks still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time-pass.|1
Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen 's everyday 's life ? Is it possible to intrude upon their everyday lives to the detriment of their fellowmen ? Does it not seem to you to be very difficult to have your ordinary life interfered by our everyday life ? Is it not necessary that we act upon our daily life to make our everyday life a living and meaningful way of having it, that we 'll be able to have it and to keep it all together ? Does it not seem that it would be so much harder for a man to interfere with his daily life?|0
Honestly , how hard can it be to make a good remake ? Obviously pretty hard ! I was soooo disappointed about the movie I couldn't get a good shot, but when I saw the trailers, they are so good , the movie is great, but they didn't make it good enough to compete with it. But when I bought the movie I can't believe I can make one. It's great, I was just waiting for the right shot. I will definitely buy it again ! It's great that the first film has it's great feel to it.|0
"I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago , and have seen every other version since , so I have always found this to be very cool

Hello

I am very much interested in seeing the Hamlet Version of Hilaria and am very sorry if I am not familiar with it. I am currently trying to make an animated version for the game but for some reason I have not got it working. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks! A:

In order to make an animated version of the story, you need to know how the animation is calculated."|0
I was duped as well. Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell do you get.An hour and a half of nothing, but awkward silences with some weird guy, who isn't weird enough to be scary.I thought there was no way $5 could be too much for a movie.Damn I was sooooo wrong. It was very hard to watch the whole thing.Don't fool yourself. Its not so good that its bad. Its not even that kind of movie.Its nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing.PIECE OF CRAP!!!!!!!|1

Oh Gawd. I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. It is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.I just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view.|1
Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson , while on an American tour. The relationship turns into what should be a bad marriage for an American woman who doesn’t want to meet a German woman in her first appearance on a British television show. Rock Hudson has had his own version of the relationship since his first appearances on his television show and now he is taking a stand against it. When Rock’s fiancée asks if they should see if their relationship is the right one for her to fall in love with Hudson.|0
I just watched the DVD of this award winning film . One Life Stand is a stark drama that through a few hundred years has given us a glimpse of what a life has been. It is about a group of young women living together in an English village in the far west of the French Quarter. The film tells the tale of a young woman who wants to make her mark in her own community, and of the people she meets in front of a mirror in her town. She is asked to look into the mirror, to make her mark, to choose which people she wants to meet.|0
At least if you 're a Disney fanatic ( well , of the variety who loves their live-action films as much as they'd like it) it is certainly a bit difficult to fall in love with an animated movie. There is a reason for that: not only is the film so fun, but you know how to turn on the internet to watch it. It's a powerful tool. You can enjoy your favorite characters (and the movies) on the internet, but you will never really get to know the people in the characters.|0
As a fan of C.J. 's earlier movie, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this film.The nicest thing I can say, however, is that it's NOT an awful film. There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancé's ex-boyfriend.Overall, though, it's pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game?)|1
While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM , I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this had to be my favorite movie of the year. It was in my opinion the most memorable movie ever, so I’m really pleased with the film’s performances and direction. In my opinion, it’s still the most memorable movie of the year, but I have to say it is certainly one of the finest performances I’ve seen in my career. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to learn new movies and enjoy the process of making them.|0
Love the TPB 's but this was a lame episode . Did n't have the same feel that the series had, or didn't have? 1. I'm so tired of the series being boring. How come I haven't really seen it in over 5 years? I've read so many great reviews on this show, I've never seen the series, but maybe I'll get another one. 2. I was so bored with the show's plot and ending that I started thinking about it a bit, but really didn't know the answer to this.|0
Cheezy? Yep. Poorly filmed? You betcha. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For sure.This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth, fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket!|1
OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. Be careful about who you see this film with - ie - DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM. I'll explain why.1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf, but is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing. I have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a 'horror film'.|1
"I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I LOVE it. Probably my all time favorite movies. But, by the way, ""badger1970"" there are a few parts with bad language, not TOO bad, but it's not exactly G rated. GREAT movie!!!!! I recommend it to everybody. Any way, it's making me type 10 lines of text, so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. Okay... Still typing... This is getting annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go."|1
Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies , mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond . Fulci's movies have made him an important figure in Italian pop culture . For many years his career has been filled with horror classics and horror films as well as films such as Dracula , Dracula's Dracula in Italy , and Dracula in America . These movies made him popular among horror fans and horror film fans in Italy. Fulci also made movies such as Dracula, as well as Dracula in the United States , as well as Dracula in the United Kingdom .|0
"It starts a little slow but give it a chance . In the spirit of the `` Wackiest Ship in the World "" . Here you can get the idea . In case you didn't know it, there was a `` Wackiness Ship (WSS) "" that was developed by British shipbuilders . When they first launched the WQA-7, they set out to design a ship that was very different and that would be the ship that you could get to learn more about. If you've never heard of the WQA-5, you probably never heard of the ship."|0
Loki , Norse god of mischief , creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers . At the same time the wearer's eyes become the target of evil. The image of the goddess in the picture is a caricature of herself, a goddess with eyes of fire and a mask. Her face is very different from those of many men and women, having an oval face, an oval mouth, and an oval back. This image shows the goddess wearing a mask, and in the background her form is similar to that of many other people.|0
"I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.If you read the ""scholars"" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression."|1
"This movie was terrible. It is not something that people should have to pay to see. It looks like some Christian group made it to convert people. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to TV.It started out like an old fashioned B movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. About 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about ""God"" and ""Do you believe in Jesus?"" It quickly moves into pure religion territory.I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.AVOID IT!"|1
"I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering ""The Dain Curse"". My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film ""The Molly Maguires""). I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south."|1
This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen . It 's hard to explain though , because (as I say) is so much worse. It's a very, very good comedy at it's finest and very funny, because it's the funniest comedy ever produced so far . The thing that makes the comedy so great is when the audience has been watching this show for a number of years , this is probably the longest running show on the internet . It's actually very funny in that it's funny and hilarious, and the only laughs it can offer are when there is only one laugh.|0
I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself ... Am I a movie critic and would I like to go see a good film that is good? And would that film have an ending? And how do I find out what I am looking for? What I really want to do is find out what a movie critic is really looking for. Also I want to start looking at a film that is good, and hopefully to find out what the movie critic is really looking for.|0
If you have n't read Tolkien 's masterpiece ; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever ! If you are going to make it the best one of them all , then you have to be very careful in your work. For a great movie experience in the Middle East , there's a lot to be said for an amazing film experience. For this movie , it's very easy to see how to use the internet to see what you are experiencing , and then make an informed decision based on what you have seen .|0
While this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director Ethan Wiley and scriptwriter Ellary Eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine Catholic bishop.Amongst the many inconsistencies: * Jacob the Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb, chasuble or surplice. Academic robes are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests.|1
"This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens . I unfortunately did not realize the damage I’ve caused by that. If you have ever been told that you have some form of intellectual problem you’ve likely heard of “bodendomia.” Well, my guess is, it’s not “genital neuropathy” or anything else I know of. It is, after all, a serious problem. There are two main forms of what can be called genital neuropathy:

HIV-1

Genital neuropathy can be defined as mild or moderate in form, often without symptoms."|0
"A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. Surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the ""Godzilla"" remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like ""The Loch Ness Horror"". And, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! We open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits."|1

... when we all know , no one does it like the BBC.Being an avid fan of this sort of show is just a big part of the reason for its popularity. This show is one of the greatest things that could be said about the show and its people that you love. So let's face it, it's not a good way to do things. It is a wonderful show to watch. There is a lot to like this show. This is just a wonderful show, with so many great people on it, you can't put it all together.|0
I ca n't really criticize this film . It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead by myself . I was so tired when I watched the film . . . In this film, there is a guy in a suit, but there is also the actor, who is in a high-school uniform, who is at the top of his class and has to wear a mask to keep his face and eyes clear. (He is wearing his hair, so I know that person, but I really don't know what's going on.|0

I watched this movie tonight and I do need to say that it is horrible! I expected it to be great, because you know, usually we don't have many movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but already in the beginning it started in a bad way: the introduction of the movie seemed not to have an end! The plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack off, you really don't have anything useful at all! The director of this film doesn't look to have some important notions about how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example.|1
Greedy land baron in the tiny western town of Prairie City wants all the ranchers off their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate; seems the town is swimming atop oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun. The farmer's seafaring son soon arrives, slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight. Another lawlessness-in-the-West story, with everybody under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards).|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see it was cheaply made. Badly scripted and with very bad acting. I have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. We couldn't take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. The experience of watching this was like The Blair Witch visits Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it.|1
Let 's get one thing straight : I like much of Snipes ' work . Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries, Snipes is still a good artist. However, when you go to work with some of his contemporaries you'll notice that most of his works aren't being done in the same style they were when they were created, but some style is being applied to it. I think that's a significant mistake, because if Snipes' work wasn't being done in style, he'd probably do something similar to his predecessors, so it shouldn't be at all unfair to me.|0
"This tough-to-see little picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous faces who sit for interviews, rarely seen TV performances and behind-the-scenes footage of Nilsson at work. There's even a few shots from ""Son Of Dracula"". This movie is the final and fitting tribute to one of the finest voices, the most clever songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. It's a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and/or performed."|1
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around, and she's at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for Seki... and a little extra.|1
First of all, since I'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of this movie, I can't comment on that.However, I DID see the original version of this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel and I thought it was just as good as anything else on that Channel. In fact, I thought it was one of their better offerings.I've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about SOULTAKER with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a FEW things about this movie and rightly so.|1
"Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling. It also starred Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen, and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death.The story begins with introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what Soultaker's role will be in this movie.Next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly named ""Summerfest"". In this film, the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class."|1
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time . It 's dull , ponderous , badly shot , not even funny . And it was very hard to find the right film to get it done . I just can't find one to make a good movie. I was not able to get a good look on the actors , and did not have the right costumes . But I do hope they like the acting . It was too good to not like it . I don't know if I can get the actors to wear the costume .|0
Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. And it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious.|1
"This film could have been great- but was n't . Amongst the cesspool of talentless no-hopers and friends of the ‘70s, that’s what I thought of and I wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to anyone who came along. I don’t think I’ve made it into the top four of this list, to say thank you. I hope you enjoy and have a wonderful time. Friday, August 21, 2015

"I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I have ever had to sit through. It was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the ""good bits"" taken out. Bad acting, the fake documentary set up, nonsensical plot, and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible, terrible film.The female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. Consider this exchange: ""He's hot."" ""He has a girlfriend."" ""Do you have a girlfriend?"" ""No."""|1
Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them . Whilst shamelessly copying my original version, here are just a few of these bits to show you how far you're going to go :-), I'll be adding in a quick note about what I learned and how I'd feel if I'd had a better time doing this :-). For the last couple of hours, I went over some things I'd forgotten I'd ever learned, to make sure they're not too difficult to explain.|0
"For a really wonderful movie, you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. Best thing I liked about this movie was the Mexico landscape, & it gets the movie up to a 2. I was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn, they were so were not desert dwellers. And Moses is said to have a speakING impediment, but certainly not here. Even the ""miracle"" scenes were contrived & un-believable. And what's the point if you can belief anything in a TV story?"|1
Two years after 'Airplane!' took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious take-off of old U.S. detective shows such as 'Dragnet'. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, America's answer to 'Inspector Clouseau'. It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane! '; clever visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities, and recurring characters such as Johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest-stars ( including William Shatner! ) were killed off in the opening credits.|1
This was absolutely one of the best movies I 've seen . Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that made me smile and laugh and laugh. This was also the second movie to do it in over 60 years. I'd also never seen the first movie, but I've read reviews and seen plenty of them, so I was fairly skeptical of it. Now I'm more convinced. I'm going to look up the title of the first movie, and tell you exactly what happened. The cast in the first film was wonderful. The main characters were wonderful.|0
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun : a call girl gets shot in the forehead with a laser beam and gets shot in her mouth with a camera. And, in fact, this is what happens : the movie makes an appearance. In fact, the movie is not really that good. It doesn't make it sound like any other movie, because you have to go to the movies to check out the movie. So, to make the movie sound interesting, I like to create a series of animations that look like the movies, but make this sound more interesting.|0
After a meteorite lands in `` Boston '' ( really somewhere in the Isle of Man ) , a hideous meteorite falls off to the west and starts spreading into the nearby islands of the UK. As we were looking for this meteorite, some people were talking about this phenomenon and what caused it. I was so confused about how it looked. In the first part, I just realized that it is a meteorite, but then I went into another section and I saw an orange light. There was only one part, I think, which I was not aware of.|0
"Let 's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : `` Let 's see how Antichrist works ? (In other words, why is he talking to Antichrist, because the movie ""The Last of Us"") ? Here's the movie:

You know how I remember Antichrist ? I remember him being an amazing guy. So when I was going on holiday, he came out of the hotel and started asking all the women how they feel about him, so I told him what I thought and told him everything about him."|0
Even though he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Great Britain and then America to continue with his career, his film credits on his film credits in Europe and North America show that he still has a very strong presence in film, particularly in his films. He was one of the main stars of the movie The Adventures of Hairsphere, as well as being one of the only actors to play the lead in the film as the film's main antagonist. This film features him as the main villain in a scene that appears to be an allegory to a plot that will ultimately be solved.|0
I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever! He gave us the awesome (at it's time)Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson to super stardom. Then followed that up with the second best movie Bruce Willis has ever been in (The Last Boyscout).Stumbled a bit with The Last Action Hero, but redeemed himself with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight.If you're a fan of action films, this has it all...Action, Comedy, Thrills, then tops it of with more Action, Comedy and Thrills.|1
I'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. I don't own any, I've never rented any, so I might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinkers that many other people have.I caught this movie on Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker.|1
It 's painfully obvious that the people who made this `` movie '' have never seen such brilliant spoofs as this! It's quite possible for people to do that for years, right? Not to mention it's just a fun spoof, no? Well, they haven't, but they can now. For the record, there's no one on that list that they've even seen. And I'll let you see it. So when you hear someone say the word ``snowball,'' it's a laugh at the beginning. It's the end of the rainbow.|0
this is the worst movie in the world . the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the sound was bad. the other two movies i didn’t like, the first and last two were bad. you know why ? 1. The first movie has a great score. the second movie is mediocre , i’m not sure about the score , i have to give it a go , because i was very impressed with the second movie . second movie is a bad movie but the last one i have to give the score a go .|0
"Help! Once again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. I rearranged a vacation so that I could see this ""world premiere."" What a mistake! Why did Schrader even want to make an Exorcist film? Lofty intentions are fine, but if I wanted 2 hours of theological babble, I would visit my nephew's Sunday school. Father Merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. But an Exorcist movie needs more! The relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production."|1
"Allegedly the ""true story"" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the same who funded Columbus's expedition), the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the Archduke Philip of Austria, known as ""The Handsome"" (and played in a rather unispired manner by Italian hunk Daniele Liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). This is a groan-inducingly familiar story of late 15th c., early 16th c. intrigue, betrayal and bodice-ripping. It drips destructive lust from start to finish."|1
"It 's the 1980 's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that's now home to hundreds of people, but if they're still scared of all the things that happen, they can't help but enjoy the rest.""

This was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots, and bad audio (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes it was blowing my speakers, even within the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted of mostly unbelievable neurotics, bi-polars, and caricatures. Character development was awful... the bratty little sister (why was she even written into the script? ), the nagging mom (again - what purpose?) the whiny girlfriend (why didn't he dump her long ago?|1
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time. It is one of the best comedies I have ever watched if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably. I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions.|1
Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made . PERIOD ! ! Yes , it 's worse , but to get a good story, this will make it feel real to your face ! . . . . ! No , it's just that when you think about that , you actually think a lot about how the characters, characters, characters, the characters , characters , character . . . it is so good. I love the characters , so this is why I love these characters ! . . . . it is so good , and you don't think it is too bad.|0
I did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. The suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. What kept it going were the good actors.But the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like Tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. Tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. At best it is for teenagers, and I am sure many of them find the character of Johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min.|1
After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK, I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/camp pedigree: I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad! Anyway, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN’S RUN (1976; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets! ), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)!|1
The Ten Steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling . I know this is a rather lengthy post, but it’s worth reading. And I’m going to tell you on the same note that some of us may not agree with the fact that the ten steps are the most important. We might agree with what you said in the last part of this post, though, and we might be wrong as to what you meant by that. 1) What are the ten steps?|0
"Well , here we have a zombie movie that perhaps is n't even being much of a zombie movie . . . I don't think it would have made sense

I think that it's probably not the best way to look at it and to think about a movie that does it better. Maybe it could have been made more of a zombie movie or at least a non zombie movie . . . You don't want to try to compare it to anything other than a non zombie movie, because then you wouldn't have a choice about whether it's okay to actually have a zombie movie."|0
Last night , I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK ( KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles ) . Oddly , I didn’t see him in his usual place as well as some other people in the background. This time it was on one of my favorite TV channels on my TV set . That was a good one for me, since it’s a little bit weird for me to have someone on one side and another side of the channel is also very familiar to me . And it was just a strange scene that I had been doing a few years before in my first year at college.|0
I am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. Being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, I bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I'd spent money buying it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is THE HORROR!!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, VERY hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film.|1
"I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films. However, I found NO enjoyment in this movie. It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending only made me dislike the movie more. It is definitely not in the same category as ""The Cave"" which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made."|1
Hello again , I have been thinking about this movie all my life . I saw it when I was about 12 I saw the last film , but I saw the first two films I had the time of my dreams . And I did it in my late teens , and I did it in my 50s , but I found that my life is very different then before . I was watching the last movie when I watched the first one and when the other one ended up with a scene that I didn't understand I watched the movie a lot .|0
"This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old ""cons turn good"" yarn, which we have seen so many times before. It actually reminded me of the American series 'The Players', although nowhere near as good. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch, as is Ribisi, who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. Danes performance was decent though, and you can see from this performance, why she was cast in Terminator 4.The MOD Squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy."|1
`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest. If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'.|1
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen . Although not directed by a professional actor, it has been shot in the dark. It is shot at night with cameras on camera, so the film is quite well-received. You will have to be suspicious to have the story told to an audience. The scene in the back of the film is set in a rural setting, where the two men work as a police officer. The camera is fixed in place, and when the officer appears, you will hear that the scene is set to a scene of rape.|0
This was a very good PPV , but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later , the WWE crammed so many things into a single show for the purpose of keeping them as popular as they were before, and it was good enough for WWE to have some great storylines come to life . It was very entertaining, but it's not enough to replace the best of the best , and this is just another example of it . It is interesting that in the ring of the same Wrestlemania, when it was the greatest show of the first half of the ring, it is the worst show of the last few years .|0
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival, we have titles from all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. Modern love...thats for sure. In that movie by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man's uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village seems like something in an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants.|1
"Black Scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car that can morph into her snazzy armored Scorpion Mobile. She battles the evil Breathtaker and all of this is an excellent recipe for a good time IMHO. I loved the bit about her having to say ""Yo"" to get the car's computer to take orders! Breathtaker is so evil he wants to give the entire city asthma! It's all so over the top and that's the beauty of it! The scene where Black Scorpion ""attacks"" her partner steals the show."|1
Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors . His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses , The Apartment Showcase and many more have been phenomenal. On the day that we started working on this film, we found ourselves working for just about every other film in the entire history of Western animation. We loved seeing the movie as a whole but we also had the greatest time with all of the people on it. We have had the chance to meet many of the people in the studio that contributed to it and we had to take a year and a day off to try to work as well.|0
Walt was particularly fond of quality . So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited version of his book in the late 80s? And why wasn't it ever released before then? Maybe it's because people didn't really care much about it. Maybe it's because he did the best he could with this book. Or maybe it's because some of us actually wanted it better than he did. Or maybe he did a good job with it. Maybe there's some good reason to believe he made the book a better read.|0
"Well,this movie is really ""PLUMPED"" HAHA Get it? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. The plot is just a copy of Pulp Fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if ""PLUMP"" (haha)! is really unbelievable.The storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. It did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. I mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh."|1
For this movie , based off of a TV show , and a serious finale . I thought that it would be fun for me to play a role in a movie and write a synopsis for the ending. Also, it’s not an easy thing to be working with in a film because of the huge amount of screen time for writing and reading. But, I thought, well, this is a movie in which I would really enjoy doing it. If I were going to be on a big budget, I would do a very good amount of reading and make the most out of this movie.|0
A lot of 'alternative' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular, misguided, overly-political, and unfunny, and the worst of the Comic Strip Presents... stuff fell into this category. But this is at the other end - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. Is Dennis a criminal mastermind or is he lying? Is he telling the truth, bluffing, double-bluffing, counter-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever? I've probably watched Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100%. That's the wonderful thing.|1
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's first shot at mainstream acceptance . In a turbulent career he has been the headhunter, producer, editor and book reviewer for over two hundred years. He's also an avid reader and loved to have his hands in the right hand column . In his new book 'The Stranger is a Stranger' Fassbinder has written for many years about the author of several popular books: 'He is not an evil man, but he is a very intelligent person' , a review in the UK, a novel of the year , which will go on sale this May .|0
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to college. All I want now is to get up in the morning. It's not so much that I have to dress up in my clothes but I can't just go to school. And that's the point. When you're an adult you usually want to go to the bathroom because you can't see people. You can't even leave your car in the car wash. But the main reason you want to go to school is to get to know everybody else.|0
... out of this movie.Sorry to say , this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival . Our copy did not appear in this file but the first few weeks of March. And I didn’t know if there was an article like this that had more to tell. I’m not sure that I saw the original article, which was the first of many that had been read in the USA, so I thought I’d check it out first, if it has any. The first page was a full page article. In that section, a lot of people were reading.|0
When I was a little girl, I absolutely adored The Swan Princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. But I figured that I would check out the sequels for The Swan Princess to see what they were like and unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. The only character I found still very amusing was the Queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part.|1
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett (A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper... and it delivers just what I'd expect from such a production: light-hearted (though cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters. That's why I've given the film 10 out of 10 - because it delivers what I expected it to deliver... and a bit more: Brett doesn't penny-pinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen. He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale.|1
I would n't recommend this to anyone , except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film , not with a movie camera , so I was thinking how I could do it , and this was it. I think it is the best. But I do recommend it to those in the audience who like to laugh at a film. It seems to be a good way of showing off the work of many filmmakers, but that would be just what I want for my students and for everyone I teach in my class.|0
Okay , that was just brilliant . I wish that the rest of Season 1 had been this strong . . . I'd love it if you had it all , but I haven't. I can't even remember who I was today, or even where I came from, or what my family was doing in the past two years . . . So let me give you a glimpse into the world this season, and I think you'd be very proud of it . . . I don’t even know where I came from . . .|0
I was just lucky I found this movie. I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $5.50 DVDs, because I watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people would see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war.|1
There are places for political commentary in film , but `` Masters of Horror '' is not one of them. In fact, it would probably be a little better if it was written by someone more experienced in their field, such as the writer or director of the film. If that is so, then perhaps Masters of Horror would be in the better position to review a new movie. However, this is just a start. It has to be seen, as it has to be said, that the film does have a good score, and that the film is well received by the audience so far.|0
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I was intrigued. However, the film is still in the making, so if anyone is interested and could give you a quick overview, please feel free to check it out by clicking here. The film was screened in Germany in the UK, the US, Canada and the UK and it had a strong score by the way. As I’ve said so before, I am extremely proud of the quality of the film and have been watching it quite often.|0
I really tried to like `` Saw . '' The story was good , and I admire the breakneck pace of it ! I've been trying to think of what this might mean to me and other people in the community ;-) It's not too long before I find myself with a huge list of names, many of them not including the original source code, which means I don't know what to do with the new code. This is not the time to talk about it :-). Anyway, I got some ideas.|0
"No music . No stupid masala . A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a few facts. The problem is in the police system. One of the reasons why police officials do things like this are that they do it with their own knowledge, they don't know how they do it. They simply know the rules of the system, and they don't have to read them. If you were a cop you could tell the difference between ""good luck"" and ""nothiness"". The police is a government body, not the government of the country."|0
The Detonator is set in Bucharest where some sort of ex CIA Government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) has tracked down a arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), things go wrong though & Dimitru finds out that Sonni is working for the US Government. After a big shoot-out most of Dimitru's men have been killed by Sonni which the local Romanian police force are unhappy about, top man Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the US & at the same time protect a woman named Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca) who is also being sent back to the US.|1
A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director . My feelings about both are different than yours and I have no doubt they are based on the same scene but I believe it is just as you said it. He was a great director but he was also a very good writer . There was no plot to the story in which the Scent is being played (I think it is a movie) and it was a mystery as to how it would be played , I am not sure but we will see.|0
Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad luck has taken its course, two of them have been destroyed. What can be done? The Seagal trilogy has begun. But the movie’s opening is a mystery. The story opens in a new universe, but the plot and characters have not yet been fully explored. This time around, the ending is the same as the previous trilogy, though there are also some changes. What is the big deal? What the hell are you supposed to do?|0
"It's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film. Three main female deities -- wise Sita, nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to. Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. In fact, one folktale is enacted first on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the movie's ""real life."""|1
"Overall, I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes, Blade is now most importantly half vampire, therefore acquiring ""all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses."" The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer, a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books."|1
A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating, the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning. But the life scenes were attractive, it's like observing than watching. It turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film, the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was confounding but somehow also overwhelming. It's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie. Mr Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar Gonzales did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories.|1
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece . I 'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD , it 's one of the best movies i've ever seen on TV , i also recommend to watch it on PS3 , it 's one of my favorite movies . I 'm very fond of this movie and hope that I get it for my birthday , so thanks for reading it , it is one of the best . P.S. The only thing I was interested about is how to set the price to a specific amount. Just to verify the prices.|0
"If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston, it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a Communist. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his Hollywood demise. ""Rififi"" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision."|1
Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero, who takes down the man, meanwhile hooking up with all the finest women that the ghetto has to provide. Mind you that these women know karate, and are fine foxy ladies.SPOILER--the end fight scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite ripping the heart out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is unrated.Plus there are a cast full of innovative brilliant characters like the Hamburger Pimp, Reverend, Mayor, Queen Bee, and others. The apparel is great, and the sets are full of 70's style.|1
2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who' history as its most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a first-rate new Doctor and companion, big audiences ( 10 million for the first episode and Christmas special ), major awards, critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the Daleks' seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell, quitting after just one series. It looked like the honeymoon was over. Luckily, the public appears to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant.|1
"I have only seen this movie once , when I was about 14 years old , but I was thrilled when I saw it , I found it by accident, and I didn't know there was such a similarity. I don't know if it was because of my age, or simply because I was just being excited at the time...I was just so excited , I just had to watch the first movie

Wow, what an incredible movie! I love this movie, so much it's so well told."|0
This movie really is that bad , and I 'm normally a sucker for bad movies , but this was the only film I have seen that was a big bad . If it had been better , we would have had this movie , but this was the worst . I 'd think that if it had been bigger . That was the best . If it had not been different from the real thing . . . I am a little confused , how did I make it to this review , how was it that I made it to this review , , , and so on ,?|0
This movie was bad on so many levels . The writing was horrible so even the best actors could not make it work. I would say that the writer of the movie was good . I do not think he was good . As a movie writer , you must understand that it is hard to know what to make of this movie as it is. It was horrible to watch. We had an audience of so many million that we had to make sure this movie was real . It is the worst movie ever . It is not good on so many levels .|0
With its rerelease by ADV Films , I 've had a chance to watch `` The Giant Majin '' for the first time since the rerelease, but now it's back. I was looking for a few minutes to see if I could find it and if so, I was looking for it on this website. There are several links here and it's in the article. In this article, I tell you a little about my new venture. This blog, which is an online platform for my writing, is a bit different. I think this is the one where I can get an honest review.|0
This is a total piece of crap . It is an insult to the awesome book by Frank Herbert . I don't care . I care too much if you read all those books , you don't read enough, I care that there are too many books you don't like . I care more that you can't read enough , you need more and more time and more books to read . I don't think it's worth the money you spend when you get a book . . I think we need to understand that the author didn't write a whole lot of material to cover his work.|0
Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (and unjustly) ignored since their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But, even in its treatment of this Swoon over does it by far. Worse, it twists, combines, and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it. While it is an interestingly made film, Swoon stinks.1 out of 10 - awful.|1
THE OTHER is a supposed `` horror '' movie made during the 1970s . It is not to be confused with '' horror `` horror `` movie `` movie''. The movie was directed by John Ford and co-directed by Bill Cosby. The movie is a remake of a horror `` movie. As such it's not a horror movie at all (though the movie is still on DVD). So the question is: Where do we get that kind of horror movie? And how do we make it a horror movie? In the 1970s the movie was a huge success.|0
Historically awful. Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity. One cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching. As with all track and filed movies, nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants. Events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown. From the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner, one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained. Likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the LA Olympics.|1
"I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely blown away. Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite ""Company"" (which was a very good effort) and ""Vaastav"" (more focused on the journey of the protagonist) which came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya.When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself ""Indian Cops have their own 'Satya' now""."|1
I am a huge Eric Roberts fan , I collect his movies and so far has get to 60 . This year, I have been to four movies to review and have had more reviews of my films than I did . I would say I had the most reviews on the movies. The most review is one of them . I know you want to watch this one, but you need to have at least one review in order to get the most out of it. You don’t just get to five movies to review when you are doing a film review .|0
Closet Land is an amazing , terrifying piece of cinema . It features only two actors in a single set of scenes. Some scenes will be in two sets. You can't see what you'll see at the time but you do get a sense of the scale of what's here. There's a lot to like about this film – I'm not sure why this is different from most films – but there are two of them. On the first day, I saw this set on DVD. On the second shot, I saw it again on a film camera.|0
Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there. A sexy comedy, about a young man quest to find his nitch in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it! Its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name, but once viewing it...will fall for the comedy/silliness that lies inside. Truly a crime that only produced 6 OVA episodes and pilot movie were made. However, being unique as it is.|1
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all, this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is superb. Even though the show is built on one-liners, they don't become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain't seen nothing yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies, notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show.|1
I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV . It 's the perfect example of how to do a movie where we have to choose between two sets of shots. For the sake of our enjoyment, I have included this in my list of the best movies you can watch today. I think it's worth taking a chance on this movie! The following is the list of the most favorite movies you can watch. It's very good, and I think it is the worst movie you can watch today.|0
"Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer, Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whose latest game - ""eXistenZ"" not only draws the attention of people who volunteer to try the game, but one who nearly kills her (and her game, too). Since she forced to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee (""P.R. nerd"") to be her bodyguard even though he only has a gun that's made out of flesh and bone and the bullets are teeth."|1
"I 'd never thought that I would be caught saying this : But I think `` Dog the Bounty Hunter'' should be a big joke !'' ``''

But let me show you what I mean. Imagine that I say: ``Dog the Bounty Hunter''. It's easy to say ``dunno the Bounty Hunter'' but you should know that it should not be a joke :-(

If I want to get back to reality it would be very useful to show how your life would have turned out in that context."|0
"Waters 's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope , and then when/if something like this happens it 'dows 's way of telling us what to look like. So, if you haven't read all the reviews yet, this is probably something I'd do too, if I were you . But let's keep in mind this:

If you aren't a cinema fan, this is the type of information we need to know to tell people what they are supposed to know and why they want to see it."|0
Well, I think I've finally seen my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good Woody Allen experience (as I've had many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance by the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the features of his other movies is multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue. This movie basically consisted of only one character - very one dimensional.|1
This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen . the acting was god awful , the story line was the worst i have seen ever , the screenplay was awful , the movie was awful but there was so much action that i didnt know what to think . The acting is terrible but i still loved the story line . So i am here and I am going to give you a better movie review and hopefully i will know what to do. If you love what i said about this movie so much, you should go watch it, it's an awesome movie.|0
"The basic idea behind ""Dungeon of Harrow"" isn't all bad. The acting, however, is bad. The lighting is bad. The music is bad. The scenes of torture are without emotion. There really isn't much there to recommend this film. You know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say ""Special Guest Star"" and list someone you've never heard of. Might as well say ""Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln."" because there's really no one in this movie you can identify."|1
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all the great sound effects. I was impressed by the film’s cinematography but didn’t care much for its sound track. When I heard it, I thought I might not be watching it again and wondered why it was on my screen. After thinking a while, I decided that it was a good film as well, and liked it. When I came back home and watched the film on DVD, I wasn’t sure why I didn’t enjoy it again.|0
"""Yagyu ichizoku no inbo"" (let's just say ""The Shogun's Samurai"") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. As an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba. Before this movie's halfway point, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone)."|1
I just finished watching this ( last weekend ) and found it absolutely hillarious , some of the scenes I’d seen before, some of the scenes from the first night ( last night ) and then I went out to watch the whole second night. That last night, when I went and watched the second night, I was pretty sure that she was not looking for me! This morning I woke up to what I’m sure was an unexpected sound… I heard a noise from somewhere else, so I turned to look, and saw that my phone had been taken.|0
"There is no reason to watch this film.Why? Many reasons. First up, the acting is awful. There is hardly a line that isn't misread - but that is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity, and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth. It is awfully written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line.""Repeat?"""|1
I 've rent the movie because i 'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i 've got for war movies so i thought that it would make a good cover for a movie, but i had a feeling it wouldn't suit me and i'd just give it a read-out and see if there was anything i'd need to put it on. This was the second time i had done so and i'm not gonna tell you what happened so i'm not gonna tell you that, so i've got to get on with the story.|0
I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film. It is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake. Or, perhaps, their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart; looking for any reason at all to dislike them?The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action film, in every sense of the word. Sure, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through, but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself.|1
"Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who 's idea this was and what soup it is and what it is that you're thinking about."" When he said it was meant to show he could go to the grocery store, he was not sure what the hell to ask. What was it about? It was not for him to be a kid anymore, he had to do it himself. It just seemed too simple. What the hell was he doing? If he was planning on going to the police, he couldn't be too quick on this."|0
I heard legends about this `` film '' ( quotes used so as not to insult films ) for a couple of years now and it seemed as if the audience was watching the films for no reason whatsoever. Why is this film so interesting and so well-done, and how is it so well-written? I just don't understand why people don't want it to appear as good as it does. And if there is anything to say about this film (which it is) it would be this. It doesn't deserve to appear as much, but it deserves to appear more and more.|0
This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time . Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least . Energy-hungry , the worst in the movie, can have no effect on an average movie . The energy-hungry version of a famous character is not going anywhere . Energy-hungry characters in a film are a waste of energy . . . . . . . . The first thing you need to do to catch the spirit of this video is check out the trailer . The movie starts off with an old-fashioned theme in which an ordinary man with a camera is trying to get a look.|0
A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People begin to wonder if they did it. The police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press. The cops speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter. They are charged and brought to trial. They are represented by publicity-seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $100,000. The evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police. Fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented.|1
As far as I am concerned , this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the one for the first two years in the series. It was as if the two films are the only things going on in the movie. The first one of those was the first time I heard of it , was in 2007, but it never happened again. I was very interested to watch it. But I was unable to watch it. But I think it's very interesting. I always thought about the story.|0
When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan , loyal retainer Kogenta ( Jun Fujimaki ) returns to his homeland. He is a member of the Samuanasuke clan , who have been usurped by the Naku clan , who is in charge of the Samanosuke clan. When he returns to Hanabusa, he must deal with his family, and he must convince his family to join his father. To this end, the Naku clan takes up arms against him, and they also kill Kogenta to keep him away from Samanosuke clan.|0
I still remember watching Satya for the first time . I was completely blown away . Here was a movie I was so thrilled about . If I had done it before I would not have survived it . It was such a pleasure . It made me smile a lot . And it gave me that feeling . I just wish I could see all of it . I wish it would just be as good as it was . This movie is so good . I never thought that Satya had been so great . But for the first time for so long , it was a great film .|0
"Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film doesn't quite reach the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while staying just about as trashy. The author of the original book ""Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman"", Emmanuelle Arsan, directed and had a smallish role in this film, which mostly pornographically showcases a very young Annie Belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver actually approves of her sleeping around and even persuades her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married!"|1
I mean, come on! This movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. Characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. They also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. It's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.I was really hoping this would be a good movie.|1
Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny. Then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating. In one of the funniest lines on TV EVER -- I think in the final episode -- he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl.|1
I know that the original Psycho was a classic and remaking it was a mistake, ESPECIALLY a shot-by-shot remake. I think that that has been more or less proven by the rest of the comments here. But there's far more wrong with this movie than just that.The first problem is the color. The original film was shot in black and white but, what few people realize is, the original was shot AFTER color film had been invented. The choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern, but it was also a stylistic choice of Hitchcock's.|1
"I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished actor, but I've seen nothing better than the films he's worked with, but I can't help but notice a bit of a different character in this one. As far as appearances go, I don't like the ""cute"" ones, but at least I enjoy their performances. I've said before about what's going on in his work, that he's great at the acting, that he doesn't just have a good sense of humor, he's brilliant at what he does."|0
The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a great job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money. But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way.As I watched the movie, I kept wondering why Disney didn't pass this film on to Miramax - not because it's particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly a movie for adults.|1
"This film is one of my fondest childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood, singing and dancing, with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit, Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyone's manager, and a generous cast of ""extras"" delivering a film that turned out to be ""okey dokey"".Kermit's melancholy ukulele number ""Rainbow Connection"" was nominated for an Oscar that year, but was beat out by Norma Rae's ""It Goes Like It Goes"". I'll pick Kermit's song any day!"|1
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes.|1
How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things about this film it's mind boggling!! I remember when i went to see JP as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, the SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast girl kicking a raptor..please!) but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience.But the the third one has no point!!|1
The TV announcer who introduced this late one Saturday night said it should have won Oscars . Quite a statement in itself, the way in which he said it, it must be obvious. Not that this is a bad thing and that's all we can do. But as I write this it is quite an exciting day for him and it is certainly not a good time for him. We will miss him terribly. I'm sure that this is a great day for him. In that case I'll leave you to do a review, but I'm sure you'll like it.|0
What is night vision ? Well according to the star ( Williamson ) let 's see ... one package store a lot of stars. They get more stars, they get more stars, they get MORE stars. I just want to make sure I can use this package and it's really easy. I can add the package to any package store. How about some other stars? It would be great. I mean it's a little complicated and you need the package but it should be easy to do! Just use the stars for this, I'm using it from the package.|0
"Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down . His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched . Earth, Earth, Earth . You'd have to see this for yourself , you're in this for the ages to see his face , his words , his actions . This is what he used to say now , it's what he always said

Roddenberry died Tuesday morning at the age of 78. He was 77. His family, many of them at the time, is in his late 20s , and his friends are in their 90's ."|0
"In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. The point should be revealing the truth. This means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of ""men off the street"" expounding on the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all."|1
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie , but this a pretty good one . So let’s talk a bit more about that. When I was little, I’d been told by friends that I should get a second chance at SITR, because I was the only one who would like it to be as good as it was supposed to be. So my friends were shocked at the “solution” to their problems. When I saw it on the Internet, it made sense that I should do something different with the movie.|0
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that , I believe , is not equaled today . The colorful history that is the history of the past is over in its current stage. If you do not know how to recognize the past and what it meant to the audience , this event can be seen as an example of an important era . As a result, I believe the audience will be surprised to know that wrestling is still an active business . What I will try to show you is not an event but a demonstration of a specific type .|0
I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line. There is not one... repeat ONE original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. The Crows.... Hitchcock did it superbly back before CGI and even with CGI this film falls short of a well done attack scene. The creepy crawly boy... The Grudge did it and did it better. The psycho...done in Cold Creek Manor most recently, however it has been done to death. No pun intended.|1
"Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movie that's ""cool"" to hate, like ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" or ""The Avengers"") I ask them, ""is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? Does anyone utter the line 'I'd rather eat a turd' in that movie? ""This movie is WAY too infantile and moronic for adults, and WAY too violent and irresponsible for children."|1
Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic, integrity, and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.|1
*SPOILERS INCLUDED*Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an amazing film, unlike anything previous. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. He didn't just break the rules, he made up a whole set of new ones.Here's the spoiler: there is absolutely nothing new, different, or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant doesn't just pay a homage to Hitch, he rips off every idea, and does so in a less original, more conventional manner. I didn't have anything against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie.|1
Wow! It's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. It's my favorite of the season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression, the drama can't get any better than that. Paranoia reigns supreme as even Mulder and Scully have doubts about each other's sanity. I've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'The Thing'. I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't know.|1
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman . She spends the night in a small house in California in search of her husband. They decide to spend her nights with him. At the same time Lupino arrives, she is killed when his motorcycle is struck by a motorcade and is taken to a hospital. Lupino and the rest of the crew manage to catch him and rescue her from the motorcade, but when Lupino takes her down the road and knocks on the door of his bedroom to say that she has been shot, he turns on her.|0
"My wife and I couldn't even finish the film. Truly, it was rather painful.First, the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. For instance, Augustus takes the ""burden"" of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great humanist and believer in democracy.Second, the camp! My lord, the dialog is horrifically bad. I recall the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child having better dialog than this."|1
I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because I am a polite person. This movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which I could have done something useful for the human kind or just me. The dialog is poor, the actors never look scared! Even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. For example the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be frightened, but he looks quite normal. The chick of the movie is such a cliché.|1
This one and the one prior `` Toulon 's Revenge '' and the next one seem to be completely different, which are actually the same problem. Here, the problem is that you can't put the button anywhere but the image button which has the same height and width as the button in the image. The second one, on the bottom-left of the image, looks like one of the images, with a lot of pixels on the right side, but there are more of the same, and you also have a lot of pixels in the upper left of the image.|0
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful, lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes. The locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water. It just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable, women. Only in the Mediterranean I guess. Certainly in no world I am familiar with. The macho men were really obnoxious, and I found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long.|1
This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen . It just was n't funny . My wife called me last week , she was saying it was no problem , it just couldn't make it so funny . But I found the problem . She said that was the problem , I have never seen anything like this . She called me on her cell phone . I am so frustrated . My wife is not happy . I really need to work on something . I can't find my problem . My wife will be calling me later .|0
I was very disappointed in this film . The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors , but still , I am so happy with the performances of that actor . The actors are great . He is a very professional and skilled actor . He is not only a great storyteller , but an actor who is very well known in the field . I really feel that his story is very interesting . I hope that it will help someone to enjoy it . Thanks for checking the film , I will try to make a movie soon . The story was really entertaining.|0
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed , creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons ( without becoming unrealistic ) and people in the modern age . The idea that one could be “realized” can be very important for us to have an understanding of reality , but not for the reasons given above. That’s why, I believe, movies can only be real if we understand how our perception of reality is affected by it. This is why I’ve written my own post on the “realness” of some movies. What the movie I’m talking about is actually real.|0
When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed.Honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. The little girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music.|1
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart , and I just knew that I had to see this movie in person before I could enjoy it, so I did. I was really excited and I knew the movie was coming out. I think the trailer was an improvement on that. But, I have to admit that I hadn’t even seen it, since I only watched the first two episodes. I didn’t want to say too much, but because I loved it, I could have done it in a heartbeat, and more importantly, enjoyed the movie too much to not do that.|0
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen . At first i thought that it was going to be worse. But if you look at the other movie that was released a week after that, you can see why. That was not as good. But I am very impressed by what has been done. This is worse than even the worst movie that I have seen. And that is not because it was bad but because that was because the film was not good. Well, I have watched several movies this year in which the movie was better.|0
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical, but in French way. And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age, full of affection and French mood. It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism (people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture).|1
One of my desires is to be a film-maker, and I just have to say there's no way I will be able to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can suggest is watching it, I got so involved in it and was extremely impressed.Estevez's and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing.And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these 2.|1
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively . Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi in this film. There are things I can tell you as a child and this was one of them. A couple of years later and I heard a friend tell me she had a son in the Philippines and she wanted to be a nurse in the US, and I decided to take his picture. And then I heard that a couple of years ago my son had come to the Philippines. He was a nurse in the US and I had come to meet the son who was going to the Philippines.|0
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie , it would be a bit of a letdown. (But no, that's not my point.) What you do, on the whole, is do what you can do, and the only real problem with doing it in this format is not to make money. If you could do it like that, you can spend as little as an hour on the set as you think you should spend it. That's not a good way to spend it in this way.|0

Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama . The lush settings , the haunting music , the gorgeous actors , and the unforgettable cast are as great as ever in this musical. I highly recommend them. It was a great pleasure to work with these great directors. I don't know how you will remember their roles, though. I don't know where they were ever performed, and I never would have seen them again. The actors were very good but you never saw them play the character. I think they should have come from somewhere in New York.|0
"Begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for Fonda , Stanwyck , and the supporting cast.Never saw this before in my career but thought it may be worth a try, if you know anything with Fonda it will tell you what to expect.Fonda is a great performer who is able to bring the artistry to bear on this character's character and what his character could possibly accomplish with a lot more. 5 comments

"I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general ( I 'm not sure why -- I just read about them in the article)

What's in the movie? What does it mean? I don't know, but that's the main difference between movies in general and prisons. We got a prison, where the inmates have to pay rent. So they are being served a meal, and they are not allowed to cook. So they are not allowed to feed themselves. They have to do so, so they have to stay in the prison until they can pay the rent."|0
Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.I've always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It's been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was pretty good. He has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it.|1
I am an avid movie watcher and I enjoy a wide variety of films . However , I found NO films for the average person . In other words , I don’t like to go to movies in theaters . I just enjoy watching movies online . However , my favorite movies I have seen in movies, and I find no movies in the list to be worth reading. I’ve been to theaters and theaters of movies in the past . I have not heard of films that were not recommended and I know there are not reviews for these films .|0
Well, that was sure a waste of Dave McKean's talents, wasn't it? Don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean may be the best in the world right now. The layered, textured look he can accomplish with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher look like what they are: hackwork. McKean has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, film, even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive collage effect he has pioneered.But this movie?|1
"I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual ""horror"" movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the ""Exorcist ""movies (Which i loved). What was up with all of those nasty ""B-movies"" she did? David Hassellhoff on the other hand, all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stick to ""Knight Rider"" or ""Baywatch"".All around, this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties, this was an awesome film."|1
"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will's ""genius"" is concerned. Not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. No, no, no. I don't buy it. While they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big ""S"" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.Among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/."|1
"Leslie Carbaga 's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer 's big move of their career. And so it is that he was able to give us this great account of what he went through during his early life:

We remember how he had to work in a hospital, and we remember how in the back of the car his parents would come up to see him and would drive him home to his mother. We recall how he came to work and how he never left home and never let his family down."|0
To paraphrase the previous reviewer's comments, if you're a Stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! My basic question is, being the experienced troopers of comedy that Moe and Larry were, why did they insist on attempting to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was so clearly not interested in giving them serious writers and veteran comedy directors? This movie plays like someone who's giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how very hard Moe and Larry are working to make every little bit of slapstick relevant.|1
Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good ! ! ! Thought it was a pretty decent release but as you might see here you have to ask yourself how much of a movie you would have made had it worked out to make it not look bad ! ! ! This is the one of those movies that is not that good. It just isn't as good. The plot doesn't even seem good as it does look good and you get the sense that you want to have a decent film.|0

In case you're wondering how it happened. I don't have time to write a good article here.|0
Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His performances in Days Of Wine And Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of Best Actor nomination. His only win was for Save The Tiger, and that's a shame. He gets melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. He actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note Glengarry Glen Ross.|1
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost, even though she's paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair).|1
This film was great ! Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job . They both look good together and really did their thing with the music! I'm not sure if this is a movie or a feature film, but the movie is pretty good. They both play great, I'm not saying this is the film, but the song. The music is good. I love how it sounds in the music box. The dance music is pretty good too. The soundtrack is good . I'm not too worried about how well the songs play in the movie.|0
Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost ca n't help but be a rather depressing tale in itself. Here you have it, you might not want to get into it at all, but if you really want to, you have to read all the reviews you've read to make sure you're not wasting money on a novel that has never been as good as the one that is being written, and also you have to read it and know what it does and how it's done, but that's not what this blog is about.|0
"In Thailand, the Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) quarrel in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins to a clan of ""good"" vampires leaded by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from the claws of Niran.I expected that ""Vampires: The Turning"" were a good movie."|1
whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot . In this case once was enough . Iron Eagle was released at the same time that he was rereleased. The next film is a remake of the last Iron Eagle movie, Iron Man . The story of Iron Eagle's development is that the story of the last Iron Eagle movie is not that great, and yet he can become the hero. But now he needs to learn the lessons that will lead to that film, and in this case this film is the last Iron Eagle movie to be rereleased because that's when he gets his lesson.|0
"One of the movies i just DID N'T want to see . I got it in the sneak-preview , but i'm not seeing anything on the screen when i look at my friends' TV. I'll have to try to get ahold of my camera for the movie but i have to admit that i didn't want to have to look at it. I'm really not getting any of the movies i just did on tv. i think i should give it a whirl....

i just watched the movie and its still not on screen at the moment ."|0
This movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and hearing, and I didn't believe it anyhow. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. Being a hillbilly myself, I know what it should sound like, and it's not Kate's Back Bay accent. The only thing I found funnier was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match.|1
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once. And trust me, you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced, no black and white. Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters.I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.|1
I thought that this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder. It wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad (many great films have been made on a low budget), it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp. Case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope, put on their makeup, and then answer a phone call.|1
Worst movie ever seen . Worst acting too . I can not imagine a movie worse then this . Nothing can compare to this movie in the last year . A few years ago this was the first movie that people saw with the camera and the sound . I think this movie could do with better performance in a lot of cases. If I remember right now, it will get the job done . But in the last year , it just didn't matter . This is what you see . It has to do with the movie, the acting , the sound, the cinematography .|0
"Return to Me is a movie you will want to own . It is a story of inspiration and family. It is a movie you will want to do and you'll get it at the box office. It is a movie made to tell stories about your parents, grandparents, siblings and friends . Monday, September 10, 2008

I know you don't want to get all the details from me, but what is it exactly? I am going to share a few things with you all. For the record this is the only way I can get back to you ."|0
I kind of like JAG . It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it . I want it to stay on my shelves . But this is just my opinion. If we keep this for a long time we will start to lose it and we will probably get more books , or maybe they will be bought for less money but we still have a lot of books to keep us interested. I do like it but I´d like for it to be good enough for me . I´m not sure how to start it , there are so many different ideas .|0
This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson . You owe it to yourself to invest in a rental theater, but there is a reason for it that the movie is worth watching. This is a classic movie with plenty of surprises, but for me, that was the only movie that I’ve seen where there’s something interesting about an action figure. You’ll find that I like to think that they are the same movie, but in reality they are on the same level. The trailer for this movie is at the bottom right.|0
"Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic ""Godfather"" and yet another case of over-hype due to media circus. Sarkar, the 13th Hindi film of Ram Gopal Varma as director is also the weakest in his Underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent-Satya and Company. The Charisma, the magnetic persona of the two Bachchans playing father-son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for. Not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which Varma should be applauded."|1
The pace of this movie is quite slow . It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (I'm pretty sure I'm not that far gone) then takes another 15 minutes to get her there, so it's pretty slow on the first few minutes. It takes quite a lot to get a guy to a Chinese place where there's not much more time to get there and the movie is about half an hour long. I have to think the movie has a lot more to say about this guy than I ever did (I was hoping I was kidding).|0
Some sort of accolades must be given to ` Hellraiser : Bloodline ' . It 's actually out Full-Mooned Full-Life. Hellraiser is full-voiced and will bring out the best in every genre. Hellraiser was nominated for the award in 2010, and since then, it has been out since the original title's release. It was chosen as the Best Original Score of the Year, and it is currently on its second season. Hellraiser had a total of four nominations per season; it was nominated for the Best Original Score in 2006, the Best Original Score in 2007, and the Best Original Score in 2008.|0
If you 're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies ( I guess it 's kind of like the way we 're like us). On a side note: I 'm always a bit annoyed about the fact that I can't watch movies on youtube. And I can't watch videos on youtube. But, I did try a couple of times to get a good look at the 'sounds' in the movies. It's like my brother is obsessed with the movie making, but my sister only makes her living for movies, not for real.|0
Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie ! It takes a long-winded bore to explain the world. I’m so sorry to see it, sorry to hear. All this and many other things. If I was in the right mind about this, why did I think this movie would have such an impact? Because it would have made me laugh! It makes me believe that the movie itself was a masterpiece. The characters are so human and the story has so much potential. But what I really didn’t see was the action!|0
"This was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Other than that, I loved the head-banging music this movie revolved around. Chris/Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They totally support their sons interests and believe in him enough to support him - now that is AWESOME!! What really surprised me was the Chris's realization at the end. It was not quite the ""hollywood"" ending on his road to self discovery. The overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller- coaster ride."|1
Peter Watkins ' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced , uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape with a rich array of weapons and armour. Its use as a tool for both the civil and private sector has never been described as 'the most dangerous weapon the Punishment Park is known for being. Its use has always been regarded as an attack on any individual, group or organization as long as they do their job properly. The weapon was introduced in the 1930s as a way to keep people and their families safe during the war.|0
"Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero (Bond) and villain (Blofeld) were seriously miscast. Lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play Bond. He looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. The director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like ""Royal Baluga, North of the ..."" just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster."|1
"THE QUICKIE ( 1 outta 5 stars ) Pretty poor movie ... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who goes undercover to kidnap a middle-aged man who has a bad heart. It's as much of an homage to ""The Big Chill"" as it is a story about a serial killer and his wife. You can enjoy the film in its own right, though, and it won't get much better than this. There's no dialogue at all. This one doesn't come off so well. The main plot was fairly straightforward."|0
The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age. Clayburgh's timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to Rome and sing as a diva. Matthew objects but comes along. He connects with the young girl again but this time, Matt is on cocaine. His superb voice, lovely, impetuous mother is in the limelight. She doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie drags on in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture.|1
Chan-wook Park , you have to hand it to the guy . In my eyes , he 's not only the most dangerous, I 've never seen as dangerous as he has been for the last 50 years. A lot of the guys I've had over the last year or two have done this, but none of them have been one of the most dangerous of the bunch. Now that we're all done with the fight, I can't believe he hasn't shot at all . I can't believe he has shot at all .|0
"It 's a talking , trigger happy , alcoholic ASS COP ! I have seen the first and second episodes of this episode ! I am glad to see it now ! I hope you enjoy watching this episode ! I think that I can enjoy it ! And I am also hoping you can join me in the Discussion! This episode is really interesting. I thought it was funny, so I'm going to make up my mind:

I can't stop thinking about it. At this time I was thinking: ""What's the worst thing?"""|0
This movie is # 1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen , with `` Lessons for You. It is also the only movie that has survived to this day. Even though I was the only person to review it today, it didn't do any good at all (except for the fact that some people are getting tired of it for their own amusement). In the film, when the story goes by and you decide to do some work on the characters, you don't feel like you were a part of the story.|0
Although this movie (and I use the term loosely) was made in 1997, we just watched it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive. I blithely watched anyway, certain that if Jones was in the movie, it must at least be worth two hours of my time. After all, he has been one of our go-to actors for years. Although Heche isn't one of my favorite actresses, I was additionally reassured by seeing another well-known face.|1
"Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. The usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a ""forbidden"" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. Fast forward (actually, you'll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding."|1
"I just got back from ""AGS"". After seeing it, I'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography ? Give me a break. The game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. Was there ANYTHING in this movie that wasn't brought up in ""North Dallas Forty"" ?Aging star player ... check. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... check. Owner who doesn't ""get it"" .... check."|1
Here's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man.Certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.Take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep.|1
"I'm sorry, but I cannot understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought ""Ethan Mao"" was. I have seen better acting, character and plot development in pornos! WARNING: I am going to give away a key element to the ""plot"". After holding his family hostage overnight, Ethan lets his vile, evil, hated step-mom go to the bank - ALONE!!! - to retrieve the piece of his late mom's jewellery which he so desperately wants. Guess what? She calls the cops! Wow ... what a twist!"|1
Earth Final Conflict began like a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens, why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race.|1
"Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the screen-writers for ""Touched by an Angel"" might have passed up as being too impuissant, Ozpetek still keeps us interested at times. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that I think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.This movie is at heart (pun intended) a story built on a big twist-style ending."|1
I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. When I read 'In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead' was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After watching it last night, I ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind blood and gore-I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Perhaps it was just that I had previously seen 'Birth' and 'What Just Happened' before watching this.|1
I think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. Best of all are the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'.|1
There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made an animated motion picture. Even though this would probably be very hard to do it, the only way this movie would possibly work is that the animated frame would be animated without a frame limit. It would also not work unless there are many films in existence that would allow you to use your own frames to represent the movie. In reality, it would work because there are already a lot of animated movies out there. A lot of films will be animated without frames.|0
"This proves just how awful the WB Network was in the last few years of its existence. As a homeschooler, I of course deplore this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure & unfunny stereotypes about the kids being ""weird hippies who are so smart they're alienated from the super-cool high school students"". Sorry TV writers, the world as viewed from inside your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show)is NOT the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality."|1
This is a very modest , very lovely movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a good cast of actors, a couple of superb actors and a great cast of actors. It has been said that there are quite a few stars who have not received the awards that they were given. Those who are considered to be the stars of the award show should be congratulated on this award and a lot of people who didn’t receive these awards. These are the most beautiful and memorable films of the year.|0
A brash , self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the Corps.In a short period of time, he gets into trouble. But as soon as he is forced to make an emergency stop, it becomes clear that there is a lot he could do to get it out of his hand. He also gets into a fight that will eventually kill him. As a result, he gets stuck with a group of bad guys in this camp. When it comes to combat, WEST POINT is extremely popular.|0
If you 're looking for a movie that 's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the character. It is not hard to find a movie where the actor who plays the hero, the hero is the one who 's having fun doing it. It is the same thing that I have done many times since I 've been in my character. If a character needs to play that role because it was the same as the whole of the universe, you have a problem. There are some movies where it is not so, but it is very easy to find out.|0
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl, who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter. Sarandon has this ability, call it talent if you will, to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl, Sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer.|1
Firstly , few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent 's lover . Secondly , few women professors have been successful in teaching undergraduates at the level of a student . Last year, a study published in The Journal of Women's History revealed that a number of professors had found that women professors are more likely to become successful in the teaching profession and teach students in some cases . On a recent day, a student of mine , who I was not able to name, had to do a small part of reading an essay , which he had to take with him .|0
"This was Hitchcock 's third Hollywood feature , and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of his own as he has become known to some critics, who say it is the opposite of his. Hitchcock says he wants to see what Hollywood's version of life looks like from ""the outside"". He also feels there are people in Hollywood who are less interested in seeing their work, who do not see themselves as ""real people"", and therefore, would not like the work they are working on."|0
You know, I really hate IMDb's censor system, since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing. But here we go. Editing time!Holy moley is this bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot summary, since yknow I've blindly rented such gems as Frailty and American Nightmare before. But this is just abominal. It's about a killer who uses Edgar Allen Poe's works as reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him.|1
"I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale . In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially the first few scenes, but after watching it, I’m not going to lie to you. I had the most fun at the time. I’ve read some great books about the characters, but there are a lot of great books about me. I do hope you enjoyed them. The one I watched last night is this:

This book started with the main character who’s the owner of the bank. He was the manager."|0
"The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not, admittedly, all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times before.Nonetheless, we haven't seen it filmed this well, with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation, or destruction, or hopelessness. All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.I was reading Chekhov's ""Three Sisters"" the other day, and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film."|1
I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends . Its reputation had preceded it, I am sure , by the middle of the 19th century . It had a very successful production, I am sure it is more than worth the price of a single film . It is a film that could have taken place in all the worlds and would have taken place a hundred years back , if that was so . I remember seeing it again when I was 13 years old at the time. There were several scenes, some of which I had never seen and which I was not sure about.|0
"Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities . It 's an enjoyable 90 minutes , demands little of the time it costs , and a lot of fun. We're going to make a movie version of it! How To Watch A Rabbit Fever

"If you're a fan of the original series, do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. In the series Aeon had no family and no motive for her adventures save selfish interests. Obviously the chimp-writer in charge felt the movie needed to cater to the ""bad grrl"" demographic by making the character deadly, but have a good reason to kill people.You wouldn't have thought it possible, but the movie is more two dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved."|1
"""Japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own"", while that may be true, it applies to all except for one thing, that being,.....Major league baseball....but not to worry, ""Mr Baseball"" is there to try and change all that. But just who will change whom, is the part of the movie that really makes it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines-on in his comedic roles. The storyline may be true to life, however the subplot is dead-on."|1
"For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation might be fine. But only for them. This is a disjointed ""Cliff Notes"" version of Mansfield Park, and if you have not seen another version or read the books parts of it would be head scratching.Why has it been so hard to do a good adaptation of this book? The one in the 1990s took such liberties that it barely seemed to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and prurient.Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a pretty country wench."|1
"It 's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.Sure , it 's horror and a lot of it sounds like it 's just not that good for the budget, but I think it 's probably the most important film in my opinion. So if you want the turd you have to pay for it right? The Turd

They 're going to put out a new film so they can put it out at the next release. I think their plan is to give it another year. And I've just been hearing a few rumors about the turd."|0
Let me tell you something ... this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as well. When I look back on Troma movie history and take a close look at the trailers for each one I can only hope it wasn’t too much to miss. So what is Troma? I don’t have any idea but I’ll share some info about what we’re talking about. In the early part of the movie Troma does have a main character named Asher, and as we all know, that’s not the same as Troma’s own character.|0
This was a pathetic movie . The Alien was decent , but the movie itself gave a new meaning to what Alien is called: The Alien. I will say, when I read that movie, I was surprised to learn that the Alien has the same name as Alien, although I thought it was alien that was in its movie. Maybe it was, but I have read other books on this film, and the name was not Alien. It had a similar name, but Alien was in the Alien movie and Aliens was the only one in the movie, the only Alien in the movie.|0
I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish . My aim is to help people who have the misfortune of knowing how to film, not to put them on the shelf. I know you’re not a filmmaker but do you think you can find good work on that? “If you have never seen a movie or read a book I can’t say you’ve never had a taste for film, but if you know that, then I’ll certainly help you there. I’ve got a film for you, which you may want to read.|0
This movie tries to be more than it is . First of all , the acting is horrible . You will also notice that the movie looks bad and I would like to take a picture of that . I have not done that at the present but it does look good as a film . However, I do take the time to make the movie look good but you should try to be able to find the best movie and the best actors for your film . I think the one I have tried to take a picture of is , this one is quite bad because I want to film it .|0
Why do people make bad movies ? Did n't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making was bad movie ? I am not sure why n't n't a good movie and i don't know that what i was looking for was bad movie ? I am sure the answer would be in no way that a movie could exist if it wasn't bad movie ... But if someone is making bad movie it is a good movie and they just need a movie to go on. What about people who say the movie is the only good movie in the world, why do they make good movies?|0
This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I 've ever seen. So why not let the TV show come out on its own? I've seen it, but I've never thought about it before! This is a comedy-drama, set in New York City, where people meet people all around the world and they see each other. This series was filmed in a world where you can see all kinds of people in a place and be able to see the people in the background.|0
The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic (and, in some respects, the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. It's nowhere near a great film, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much an expose of junkies (if you want the best expose of that read Naked Lunch, if you can get through it anyway, besides the point), but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives.|1
I saw this at my in-laws ' house one night when it popped up on TV and my mother-in-law said, 'You can't stay in my house and you'll have to go all the time, you'll have to live in your own house'. So I tried it. And I tried it, but it still didn't work. So I stayed with my sister and my mother for a year before moving back home. And that was when I was diagnosed with a rare disease, so I ended up at the hospital, but it didn't do anything.|0
Mario Van Peebles tries to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL over there. You’ll have to get to know him for a few weeks because he hasn’t played any of the games that you can see on the video and it doesn’t give you any sense of how good he is. The game was originally developed by Atari and released in 1995. As such it is one of the most complete games ever released on the PC. The game’s name is a little ambiguous.|0
I saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe I have ever seen.Completely unfunny, low budget, boring, rubbish script, terrible acting - The entire audience (young and old) sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it... there were literally only about 2 places you will laugh in the entire movieMany people left halfway - Can't blame them... I stayed thinking that the film would pick up, however, it never did and I wish I'd left.|1
Its my favourite film because there 's so much going on that you do n't see at first and so much that is going on and it goes on and on, I've been wondering if it's going to be like this and I'm just getting back to it, which is that I can see that it has a big effect on the movie and that it can have a little effect on somebody's personality. I think it could be a little more interesting. I think the first time I was thinking about this movie, this movie, what was it going to be?|0
"I found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.The dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?It felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. The stereotypes and jokes about ""men's groups"" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. As it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.Apart from the attractive Irish man - this film was a dud."|1
The Evil Below starts on 'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683 ' as the 17th century treasure ship the Elbe cruises out of Portugal to the East and south of Lisbon before sailing south again to Spain. The ship has been left in port for over two years after it leaves the port on its way to sea. After leaving the port on its way south, the ship finds its way back to the ship on the other side of the strait. As the ship passes between the ship and the ship's dock, she steers in a course to the south before heading back to port.|0
"Black Scorpion is a fun flick about a groovy female super heroine who wears leather tights and drives a car. The film is also a comedy about two teenagers who share the same life in the same city. But as the film is about three young women working together to become a super hero, one of the first things they do is to find out the real reason behind why they are so bad. There are three main characters in the film:

Ivan - The title refers to the character. Ivan is Ivan's girlfriend, and it's not a bad title for a man to call his girlfriend."|0
Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it's must-have. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come. The current rating however (3.2) is too low. The movie might lack a good storyline, and isn't a great sf-movie altogether but the acting is good enough (and like mentioned before, Jolie's acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very direct, with a lot of close-ups. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, leaving van Damme out was a very good choice.|1
`` Eaten Alive '' goes down much easier than Ruggero Deodato 's `` Cannibal Holocaust , '' but it 's much harder to win over. The main question of choice is whether the movie will go over or under and what we will get out of the movie. So I think it is up to you whether or not you want a movie to make you happy. It is hard to tell what is going on here, but you can say there 's one of the reasons for the war, the war to be fought.|0
"Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might, as well, have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. ""Kay Hoog"" reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, quintessential man of mystery- and the very first ""Dark Knight""- was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage's first name first and add to it the Kent, you end up with- voila- Clark Kent."|1
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I did n't want to watch it , but I found the story very interesting and it was just as I would have liked watching the series if I didn't know better.It was really fun,and I thought the story was interesting. I can't wait until the next one, which will be one of the series in which I would watch The Guardian.I also enjoyed playing with the girls,they always seemed to be good at their work,and I liked having the chance to get to know her better.|0
"So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that SciFi Channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the ""Carnosaur"" trilogy, ""Pterodactyl,"" ""Raptor Island."" Then I flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie SciFi placed in its glamorous, Saturday prime-time slot. Some movie I had never heard of before called ""Raptor."" I was pretty excited. The movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a Velociraptor."|1
`` The Journey '' is a romantic version of the cold war . It 's about an English woman (a girl) who has gone through a time of a 'sickness'. It 's is about one 'sick' in a way which is 'like' a cold war . The journey '' is about an older woman who has moved on after the end of the Cold War , but is back in the United Kingdom . 's is about one young woman who is 'tired' but 'lives in a 'sickness'. In the UK they 'tire' their young and lonely lives .|0
"No doubt that the indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I've seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the performance of Paul Vario. I first saw Paul, or ""Big Paulie"" as he was called in Danny Provenzano's hit indie, ""This Thing Of Ours"". Thankfully, the ""Eddie Monroe"" filmmaker(s) did the same and utilized Paul's undeniable skills in a principle (principal?) role. Out came a performance (on camera and voice-over utilization as well) that shows worthy of big-budget studio roles in the very near future."|1
The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I ca n't believe the amount of bullshit that this will take up is enough to make you feel anything. I do hope this season is successful. I have been trying to get my hands on all of the pictures that I have been trying to get the most from over the past year. So, as I was writing this, I didn't want to get involved in this thing and I thought I'd write a long post about what's going on with this. However, I do have a few comments that you may like.|0
This film has made e mad . I believe the original of this film , 'The Mask ' , was not original , but original . It is an adaptation of the original The Mask , which was shown in a different way . It tells a different story then the original . It is also a adaptation of the Mask . This film was also an adaptation of a movie from The Mask . This movie shows how a person who knows a person's name can be a real person , so if you know someone's name , then you can see their face .|0
I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Push Cart, and this film is equally good. This slice of life is almost a documentary about how life on the edges is lived.Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister who live in a small room over an auto shop. There are no parents; they are on their own surviving. Ali supplements his income by stealing auto parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Izzie supplements her income working a food truck by selling herself.|1
Crispin Glovers ' way of acting ( and not only his ) is tremendous . You really want to believe what you believe. So many of the people that are interested in acting are just doing it. If you think you're a serious actor and you think he's interesting and you want to make him interesting, then you are a real person. If you don't like a character or a piece, you are a big hypocrite . That is your job. That is your job. You will do anything you want to do, you are a real person.|0
A small-town schoolteacher ( Geena Davis ) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to take things too much too fast: “A year ago at school, my teacher said to me, I had a big head injury, and I did it. I thought it was something that would make my body feel bad, but it didn’t. When my teacher asked me if I thought I was getting out of the school because of that, I couldn’t tell her, it wasn’t. She said it made my body feel worse.|0
For a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important side of it, and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish husbands. They have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. If each one of these two women had been alone, imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. They found each other and they fell in love.|1
Despite having an absolutely horrid script ( more about that later ) , this film is still vaguely watchable just a little bit . I can tell that it's not as good as it could be. Just a little bit of humor . And while this may be a little overkill, I think there's quite a bit more to it than I'm really used to. I think that this is a really interesting film. I don't think I'm being too preachy about it, but I would have liked to have been given some time.|0
"I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB . The movie was bad but the review itself was wonderful. The action in the movie was well executed and was very enjoyable. It was one of the best Shark Hunter movies I've ever seen. It was a great story, great cast and it was the best Shark Hunter movie I ever seen. I can't get over how good I was in the second half. Shark Hunter! 4/7/2009 11:45:45 PM

at the story. It is reality mixed with Americana- and very original.Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring life working at a minimum wage job, in New England. Her sleazy boss propositions her- she quits and takes a little bit of cash from the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and her Ford Escort dies out. She then meets a personable older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and graciously offer to help her out- it isn't safe for a girl to be alone on the road.|1
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie ( you do n't have to throw cartloads of movies out of the theater) but if it's a real thing, I don't know what I would do in the future ( I have no intention on it) because if I have to, I'm sure I'll get bored of it. There was some really interesting plot development. This is the main plot of the book and the main reason why it's important ( I'm not familiar with the plot). But it's not like it's boring.|0
"Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, this is the first one which made me think of the ""wasted talents"" expression. I had never EVER seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein,and so on). The ""aging"" make-up is quite awful and, to make it worse, lit broadly. The use of music (e.g. love at first sight for the young aide de camp) is at times so caricatural that I could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly."|1
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman 's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. As much as they were enjoying themselves, there were some things that stood out to them as they sat on a bench at the end of the room in front of him. Some of these had been brought out for a group of guests, but most were still having their time in them. One woman in the room and three other girls sat quietly while the couple spoke. The woman said that this is the way people look at life.|0
I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money ( and time ) I have ever seen on screen. I've been waiting for the moment I've seen the trailer for that movie. I've seen a few of the first trailers for this movie, and I've noticed that the trailer for the trailer for this movie and this trailer is the best I ever saw. I don't think people will ever get to see these movies on screen again. That's fine. They should be on screen again, no problem.|0
Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival , over three years ago . I went in with no intention of being a film fan. I have been watching the films since I was 16 and I was impressed. I have watched everything I want to watch, but I am more interested in the movies and watching the shows from the past. In the movies I have seen over the years, I have watched the most of the films and I have watched it a few times. I want to be able to watch as many as I can and to really experience the films that I am watching.|0
Hehehe . This was one of the best funny road movies ever ! I laughed so I fell out of my chair and started to write. I thought it must be one of the worst films I had ever seen! I remember being so upset at the way he had turned out that he had to do something to make her laugh, which he did, but he got her to get up, take her to the toilet, tell her that it wasn't a mistake to start screaming and crying, but she couldn't because she didn't understand.|0
Ten years before `` The Matrix '' and hot on the heals of `` They Live '' came this brilliant new chapter in their history with The Matrix. The story of the game of The Matrix begins, in the late 1980s, as it became the theme for the new season of the popular ``The Matrix'' game. At that point, in the ''The Matrix'' game, the story of the player takes place over three decades before The Matrix began. Now, the story of the player continues on the basis that The Matrix has become a major part of the history of gaming.|0
Wrestlemania 6 , is an entertaining Wrestlemania , if not an entirely successful one . The Ultimate Challenge , is something that Wrestlemania , would have never dreamed of , had they met on a reality show . It's a fantastic way to kick-off your Wrestlemania and it's a fantastic way of doing it . If you're in the business of wrestling , or if you've ever taken the plunge and made a decision to do something you haven't considered , I hope you'll enjoy this . It's a series of stories that you've read and will probably start to catch up .|0
Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing. Noah as Abraham, Lot as his wicked buddy. Laughable special effects. Overdone acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommorah were destroyed before the Flood? Strange twists and too many sub-plots the Bible doesn't mention. God as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.B-movie wannabee director John Irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.|1
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It' s set on a country house on a weekend. As always all the guests are suspects and it's up to Poirot to figure out the truth. With movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so I'll stop here. What I loved in the `Hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. Everybody seems to be the culprit.|1
As far as fake documentaries go (fakumentaries anyone? ), this one is up there with the best! It looks very real and that is what it aims for. In recent light of events (Guantanamo) this movie is even scarier, so you could say it was ahead of it's time, when it was released in the 70s! One can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist! Looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that? Of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same (70s mentality): Screw the politicians and politics in general.|1
"Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody, I have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it. I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed ""genius"" by anyone who watches it. Is that really what film has become? Or is it that any time someone says ""Wow, that is so cool"" everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own? How this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general."|1
"This movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on-screen, and issuing a gravelly ""haaaa"" at every scene involving a computer or mobile device).For everyone else, it's a mean-spirited, bungled ""comedy."" The movie strictly follows the formula of the later ""Scary Movie"" films, as well as ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating."|1
This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. Well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. The whole plot doesn't follow on the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns to other movie like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense.|1
Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It's a good movie, looking at after war, psychical problem, from the other point of view. Emilio Estevez is great as a young man, haunted by the demons of Vietnam war, causing problem in family. Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father.It all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past, with whomEmilion Estevez's character can't seem to deal, and Martin Sheen's character don't want do deal with.Protective mother looks at this problem with warm , and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons.|1
Pacino , and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker . I swear , I am an avid movie watcher for the last couple of years . I’ve been thinking about movies lately as I’m getting ready for bed . So far , I have done a few movies with Maconadump.com – I’ll be checking it out . This week, I got an idea and got a review from the staff at Maconadump . You can check it out below . If you like what I have written, please leave me some feedback or comment .|0
In Moscow, the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are in deep love for each other. With the World War II, Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before Veronika's birthday, and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news from Boris, Veronika is raped by Boris' cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However, Veronika does not forget Boris, and keeps waiting for him.|1
"So many of us who are devoted to the ""art"" of the motion picture will disregard or forget that movies are also business ventures. Most of the time, they are far too costly to produce to be anything else. In light of this, it often seems a miracle to me that really great ones do get made every now and then. Once in a while, the film-makers will go so far over budget in producing a film that the businessmen responsible for funding the enterprise will be badly hurt financially and will of course become very angry about this."|1
"It is difficult to compete against classic greatness , but once you make that choice and the decision is in your own hands, you can enjoy the best of your sport at the same time. Here is a simple solution:

It is the right way to do it! It will take just a few minutes and a few seconds to build up your skill set. It will take a few days and a week to develop your technique, but it is very good for everyone if you are an athlete or an athlete's athlete."|0
A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). Tracking the killer to his home, DeCarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before he was caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick.|1
"The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of ""Drake & Josh"" fame, personally I'd have given the movie to Josh who is much funnier) and the ""Rick Punchers"" joke is lifted right out of Airplane so the writers were obviously already scraping the barrel for ideas for this film. Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG) playing Dr Strom."|1
"You ca n't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money . Most of the people in this room are the people who don't make movies, but the industry is all about $100 million dollars. That's not a lot of money. And for that matter, people that are making money from movies who don't think they're going to be big enough to pay that amount. They're just going to have to invest the money to get it for them to make it."" I don't think that's about money."|0
"Soultaker was written by and starred Vivian Schilling . It also starred Joe Estevez , Gregg Thomsen , and Robert Downey Jr.. The film is scheduled to end in March. The screenplay was conceived by the co-founders of the BBC. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, film critic Roger Ebert, producer of the screenplay, said: “It’s not a nice story, but it is a great one.”

He added that it is also a work of art, although he believes the writing is “a little too much” for him."|0
"Who said it had to be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. You'll enjoy the experience much more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. I appreciated not having to be concerned about ""questionable elements"" in a children's film for once. That, to me, is worth the price of the ticket. And it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film."|1
"in his descriptions of CAA, platinum card lunches in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown he never took, and free trips to Nicaragua, financed by Columbia pictures.It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) ropes the audience in, laughs at himself (perhaps because he did not take the Hollywood thing oh-so-seriously) and gets us to care.This monologue is not just about ""The Killing Fields"", or ""Swimming to Cambodia""; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees them."|1
Ken Burns ' `` Baseball '' is a decent documentary ... it presents a clear origin of the game , and also the development of the system itself , and as such it may serve as the basis for the present movie. He also offers a very entertaining and interesting presentation on the concept of `` Baseball » as a collection ». As we've seen before, the concept of baseball was initially developed by baseball writer and producer John McEwan but, when he became famous, baseball writers started to develop a new concept of the game.|0
I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the video tape years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year.Grammer has a wry wit about him that really makes this movie a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it's very funny nonetheless. I am very surprised that it didn't receive higher in the ratings.It ranks as one of my all-time favorite comedies. It's just a fun little flick that makes you feel good. And sometimes, that's all a movie is meant to be.|1
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film . I thought it would be a great opportunity to try something new. I don't remember what I had in mind. And if I can't find it, what else could I possibly do about it. I think I could have made a couple of movies, but I've never been really keen on making a film. This is not going to happen because there is so little of the film being done here. It's going to be something that I could work with.|0
"This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts. It suits them well. It's not funny, the acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. Wanna know why? Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead ""actress"" Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted."|1
Based on a fairly bland `` best seller , '' this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played at some point, would seem like an easy, straightforward movie. But that's not actually what it was, and there's no way to test this film. To get the most of a movie that might have taken place in the last couple hundred years, I'd need to make two assumptions. One, there'd be nothing to do with it, and that's the main reason why I don't get to do this movie.|0
Oh man, this movie was toe-cringing bad. Bad look, awful story...the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie.Yes sure it's supposed to be a comedy and all but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real deal. The movie most certainly does not start of as a comedy but more as an adventurous movie with fun elements put in it. You can especially tells they were serious with this by the acting, that was in a serious and non-comical way, with the exception of a couple of over-the-top sequences obviously.|1
I worked on this atrocity ten years ago . Luckily for me , no one knows it because I did everything that is right with them. But they have made it so much easier for me to be successful in life and I have learned a lot about what is possible without them . And today , I'm hoping I will be the perfect person to be working in the future . This has been very difficult . We have been trying to teach the world a lot of things and I have tried to teach some things . But I really don't like it .|0
I really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by Stephen King that I didn't finish. I was truly disappointed, it was the worst crap I've ever seen. What were you thinking making three hours out of it? It may have a quite good story, but actors? No. Suspense? No. Romance? No. Horror? No. It didn't have anything.It's got this strange, crazy science man with Einstein-hair, the classic thing. Not real at all. And a man keep getting younger all the time.|1
My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival . It was great . Stormy is doing his last short film with the same name . I would highly suggest getting his new film , it is a film about the people who call him and how those who live with him know that he is really a man. He works with many different people working for him so it will be an awesome movie . It is a great experience for me if you look around. He is doing this film and it is called .|0
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about an 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece.|1
This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. The kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. A title like this makes a film flop, even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell it..This is a long film, but largely worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride, her rich husband, a theft, an identity switch, and obsessive love.|1
"Pete's Meteor. I seen this referred to as ""authentic"" and a ""gem."" I caught this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I kinda wished that I didn't.Apparently this was noted as being Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice that Pete's Meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother."|1
This appears to be two movies spliced into one. In the first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I'd never heard of her before either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this concoction.Before we know it, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I'd fallen asleep somewhere. I hadn't. She no longer in a small town but on her way to the title Honeymoon destination.The movie has some cute moments.|1
Dictated by thin experience (of both life and industry) and no cash Sofia Coppola's early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus. The cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b&w (it's difficult to tell the characters apart). The sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance.Yet there are one or two things to note. Inamongst the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close-up shots.|1
A moderately interesting start , some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan , and a promising idea . But the execution seems to go the wrong way for the second part , since the story is almost the same thing as the first part. I liked it in the first part , but I don’t think it really fits the plot as well and I can’t explain why there is a lot of dialogue on this one. But in the second part , a bit of dialogue in a scene in the novel, it just seems to me like there is not much dialogue.|0
This is an odd movie . On the surface it 's no different to many other d-grade gore movies but if you have never seen it you will notice that it has one major problem, it has one basic premise: It is not possible to shoot a gun in a certain location or any other location by way of camera. There are two methods of shooting such a gun. The first one is to use a small lens and a large lens. In that case, you don't have a real gun, and that's not the problem, but that is the problem with the second one.|0
"I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, as a result, I'm having a hard time describing these shorts. Let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial.... members. And I loved every minute of it.Not that it's ALL crude humor. It isn't. They stray away from fart gags for the most part, with the exception of one sketch entitled ""Pizza"" in which they use one very well."|1
"In my analysis of ""Trois couleurs: Blanc"" I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of ""Trois couleurs: Bleu"". I think it's the same with this film. This time it's not because of a tragic comedy-element, but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, it seems to me that she might be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who experiences big loneliness."|1
"In his feature film debut ` Yellow , ' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood 's portrayal of Asian-Americans in a new film entitled ""Black & White "". The character was initially portrayed in an Asian-themed film by Michael Chaykin . But after Chaykin died in 1990, the role was revived and the actor's name was made into an official film character for the next two decades. "" Black and White"" was produced in 1996. But after a few more years, the film was canceled and Chan Lee was left in his place. """|0
The prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984 you might have caught it on the Movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But ironically this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes Jim, namans drive in showed this in June of 84).|1
Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles . Even if you attempt to pull your teeth together you can’t resist the urge to laugh at the thought of doing this. So, what do you do after lunch? You have a good idea of where you are at. You put your lunch on hold and get out. You’ve put your lunch in the trunk, put your lunch back inside, and head to the gas station. This is where you get your lunch. You get your lunch back.|0
"hello all Denver fans ! i could n't agree more with you guys ! This show was so cool and fun ! And its not my first time to visit the show ! i wanted to visit Denver and its such a great place and i have a big passion for sports, so this show is a big deal for me ! :D :D :D

There are so many amazing people in the world who make sports and sports related videos that they can never understand why the person who made this show is so cool ! It is such a great experience for sports and sports related people !"|0
I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was appalled by the film.I think that if you hadn't read the book, you would have been lost watching the film, as it provided no real back story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her experiences at summer camp, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she has never been in therapy until Dr. Sterling)...).|1
"I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version . I rather enjoyed it . Either way , I think it is worth it. Re: MST3K version

Re: MST3K version

You'll love it, but there's really only a one-year gap to this version. Even if it's not a one-year problem, it's one-year problems so you can get around to it, if that makes sense. (I'll post a little bit here about that in a few months.) You'll love it. But it's probably not going to make it any less of a problem as it's a bug."|0
Loki, Norse god of mischief, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. In the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. Add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad.|1
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema . By seeing this film , we can observe that people who have been affected by violence, sexual abuse, or other negative aspects of society have a better understanding of who they are. And this is something that can help in understanding how and why they have such a negative impact on their way of thinking about their culture . This is something that is very different when you take it into consideration that there are a number of significant cultural differences between the American and French speaking cultures.|0
"As a fan of Henriksen (I liked him in the ""Millennium"" series) and of course Lorenzo ""Renegade"" Lamas, I had expected at least SOMETHING from this film. Sadly, the plot is predictable, the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts don't work out. Sometimes it even looks like they've captured some shots from Microsoft Flight Simulator.The cinematography sucks as well. Unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts (from the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made-for-video-look."|1
The stage star Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little film. After years of being on the stage, she is going to visit a small college town to check up on her son who is being raised by his grandfather. The kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk. Part of the problem is that he is a college clown the other part is that he's really spoiled.Interestingly, it turns out that Mom is really quite wealthy and has been not only funding her son's life but is a hefty contributor to the college.|1
A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the actors very little to work with. Roth covers it up as best he can by being all mouth; Hurt has about as much menace as a fluffy bunny and Stamp can't seem to decide whether he's playing an ex-London crook or some toff straight off the playing fields at Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol she does what she can but her character is no more than every northern European's idea of the stereotypical Latino woman who's all pouts and hot temperament.|1
"Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke . He might , as I have said , be considered as one who is capable of such a thing. “

–

If this is the case, why then would I have the feeling I should do so? What would go wrong? Would it be that there is no way of getting a copy of a disk, but perhaps I would write it on it, or something, or a file in it? This would be a very dangerous thing to say."|0
The plot : Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct , and is looking for his 1st and 2nd directorial direction but I think they will be a great addition if they continue their relationship. He's one of those who is so excited about the project and I think he is about to give us a shot at making the film and it might be that they will eventually get in a couple of things together. But then he gets it done and everything is done for the money. We will see the film for the first time.|0
One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. Surely few expected his most riotous, unrestrained film, a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy, exciting suspense, mocking manipulation, and astonishing flights of fancy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif, but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life, and hence the society he represents or is eager to join.|1
"It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of ""The Comebacks"" somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes,""The Comebacks"" could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie."|1
YOU BELONG TO ME ( 1941 ) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy ' which started in the mid-80s, with some of Britain's best comedians and actors in the early 70s and early 80s, but which is now gone. In fact, to this day, comedy has a great place in our lives. We have the best-known comedy writers who wrote the most successful films (or TV shows or sitcoms) for years. We have all heard about the BBC and ITV and we all know what comedians do, whether they write funny things or they just like to run a bit of comedy.|0
This was such a great film . It was done with such beautiful design , such symmetry . I love this story of a man who is trying to save the world from his evil, but cannot. It is hard not to enjoy it! I hope you find it interesting and have a great day. Thank you . I would recommend this to a friend . It is a nice film , which is really worth a look . I am an avid reader . I have loved watching this movie so far . Please give it a try . I hope it helps .|0
"i was one ""chosen"" to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is based on the video game ""far cry"", a for its time really good game (2004). second you should know that the regisseur of this flick is the great uwe boll. this is a man, who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes movies out of them (VERY horrible ones....).i still remember when i saw boll's ""the king's swords: a dungeon siege tail""."|1
This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. Unhappy 'easterners' are not pleased with being out west; so they hire a drunk wagon master(John Candy)to lead them back east. Sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but then I honestly don't like him at anything he does. Ed Lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain.The movie was dedicated to Candy. He died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed.|1
It's 2005, my friends...a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology. So, why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low-budget film. I've seen a lot of low-budget movies that rock my socks off, but this one...it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible. Just...don't...watch it. I can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a small child produced this entire movie.|1
First of all I dunno if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was too busy doing other stuff. I think the first thing that caught me was my imagination, especially during the film. I didn't know what to expect from the script but I was very impressed. I think the idea of making a movie that I would have never heard of is just that you're in the right place, and it's one of my favorite films of all time! I think it was the first time I'd ever read the script for a film I worked on.|0
A gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on Le Touquet for a week 's holiday . Stories intertwine , characters , and time , and they make it their job to make things feel real, and so they do. The story is based on a trip to Paris on July 14 in the summer of 1898. A trip of six months took place over two and a half years. This trip began as a visit to a school in Paris, and lasted for two years. It is not the first time Paris has had such a rough trip, but we’ve learned that it did happen.|0
I 'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book . Given the number of characters and subplots in the movie, it might be a lot to look up to when you get a chance to watch the book itself. This has been a problem in recent years for some people, especially when they have been trying to get a full screen view of the movie when it comes out. While it would have been nice to be able to see a few characters in the movie, that was a problem for most people who are not as familiar with the books and characters in them.|0
This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. Moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship. However, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where Moran is concerned.|1
Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons, I had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (The first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on TV.) Once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. That's pretty much it as far as plot development goes.|1
This movie was so awful that I ca n't even describe it . I was amazed that I even sat in my car outside my house for quite a long time before the video ended. It was a good movie, it was funny, but it was also awful and horrible, and it would have saved my life. Now that she’s gone, the movie may be better, maybe better, but I’m not gonna let her get the message. Now that I have her back, she’ll get a real life.|0
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who, as a child, specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool, only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didn't matter, as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule. For those U.S. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey, it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey.|1
Like classic Hollywood musicals , the plot is just an excuse . A must see for those interested in French music , it is a great idea that people can find and buy an album , and then they get paid and watch it for free, so that is what is popular . The artist that is not interested in a musical is just like a fan who is in the right track for a show , but like a fan that is a fan who likes a show and they watch it for free , and then they get paid for the music , so that is what is cool .|0
"""Admissions"" is a fine drama even though they're are some problems with the ending. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who is trying to avoid college. To make her overworked mother not notice, she makes up poems that everybody thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote. All the acting is first-rate especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both put in great performances. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First is the character of Stewart Worthy played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the ending."|1
Eddie Fischer was simply bad . Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a house, stole a gun from the police and shot and then fired at his wife's boyfriends, who were on drugs, killing her. It's pretty bad in this film. The scene is about his wife, who was with her boyfriend. She was shot and she dies after she falls in the shower. She's in the bathroom and she says she's sorry she was shot because her husband had to leave and she was too scared to be seen.|0
When I saw the trailers for this movie , it looked like a good romantic comedy . I expected some action , but there was none. This movie has something to prove , so I was happy to see it. As I recall , the trailers were really a bit more interesting than the films. This movie is very interesting. This movie will be very popular in the future because it is one of the most widely distributed movies ever made , and I could see many more movies coming out in the future due to its popularity in the USA.|0
"There are two things that I noticed in this film. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) When Cole takes Bill to his first B&E, he finds the ""box"". As soon as Cole finds it he says, ""The box. Everyone's got a box"". A minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, ""We're actually very fortunate. You don't see these often"".Observation #2 (Spoiler Alert! )I had to watch the thing three times, I couldn't figure a couple of things out."|1
"Don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on an earlier film . It`s not because this is a pointless re- film . That is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the "" remake "" of THE GET AWAY from a few years ago . The scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( But with a director like Van Sant at the helm we should be thankful ."|1
I saw this title again on Shemaroo . I also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same show this season. I didn't know much about him but I would guess he was 19. So when we watched this episode, I started thinking of her and the two of you as young people. So maybe it was more of a love triangle between the two of us. I also watched this episode and I couldn't wait to see her again. It was my first time watching a season with her. We were both 18, and the show wasn't good at the time.|0
Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival , we have titles from all over the world . China, Italy, Spain , France, India , USA , Germany , India , Korea , and Japan . We do not know what is most popular among our fans, and that is how we have them in the world . In a world that is more competitive than all others , it is necessary to look at each category and to decide the winner. This is the first time we are going to show you the world's top competition feature .|0
As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms ( actually only a few of them), there's nothing I can say against them and I can't change anything about their characters. So why do they keep on showing? Because they're so good to show. Anyway, the problem we have is that all the people who actually know us now have done our jobs before. And as much as they could do, they could not, so why go to so much trouble trying to do something else anyway, because they know it's not done.|0
I've waited 9 years to watch this film, simply because i never saw it advertised on TV. Eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. It's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace, with no drawn out, creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. What lies beneath - over hyped and crap. Mute witness - low budget, not hyped at all and very good.|1
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in English on ITV. We were told that it was not suitable for broadcast in Britain. We were asked to look at the advertisement and we were told they were “inadequate”. We were told we should not broadcast in English because there is no such thing as an appropriate English advertisement. We have been told so many times when we have had complaints about them over the years, and we have heard it.|0
This movie was really funny. The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy, should get over themselves. This was a fun movie to see with interesting and funny characters, plot lines, dialog quotes and catch phrases. I rate a movie a 10 if I have bought the DVD, or in this case, the videotape, and have watched it many times, and in this case, still laugh out loud. I have about 12 movies in my collection with a rating of 10 and about half don't have anything do do with the Oscars.|1
I tried to give this show a chance, but it really doesn't sit well with me. Although the performances are good, the writing isn't. The two oldest step-siblings, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I get the impression that we're supposed to side with Casey, given that she's the protagonist, but I don't find her at all likable. The parents are continually portrayed as utterly clueless. The three younger children are the most watchable things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up, and Marti is adorable.|1
"What ever happened to shows with united parental figures? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children. Instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they let her get away with murder. They can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. Yeah, great plan. Just ignore their behavior because they're ""cute."" This show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the ""divide and conquer"" technique is the best way to get their parents to ""cave."""|1
"As was mentioned by others , could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see it and not to see the film? I have watched a number of films which were very good , but not in their original form 

A:

I can't put it into a more concise answer because I have had the opportunity to do some analysis. I will try to make this answer as succinct as possible, however, it will provide a better idea of what is happening and what we have to do to make it successful."|0
After their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.From the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). The 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events I've ever seen in a film. It would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life.|1
"SPOILER ALERT! Don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot beneath its shell. Besides the apparent connections with ""Oldboy"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action.The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, ""sang"" means ""blood"" in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju, played by OK-bin Kim."|1
"I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going . But when I saw the monster he was standing . . . ""Is he coming?"" ""It's not possible to know who he is unless I've got my own eyes on him. The kid's only twenty, and it's an emergency."" It was an emergency. The kid had no idea he was the one who had given him that emergency, but there was no time like the present to think, and he didn't have to think long."|0
"Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric , or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never learn anything else

I have never heard about this issue before , but this is what you hear most of in the world , and I have been talking about it for a long time , and I am sure many others , and I don't know why . And I am a bit skeptical, but I find it to be interesting ;) 

I don't understand what the problem is here , but I can say that there are many problems in the world ."|0
"This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to. It is clear from the start that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously.... the other principles were walking through their lines. I think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks. Sean Bean ""acted"" as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was."|1
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday . There are good and bad things in this city, even when we're on the same wavelength as the white man. When you go there you can look at the people around you, you don't know what they're thinking and how to treat you. You can't be so proud when a native comes walking in, the first thing the natives see when they're looking at you, but then they see another thing: you look like that.|0
Never mind the serious logic gaps, never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals, never mind the haphazard writing, and you might like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be endearing, the heroine who you root for to be saved,(or in this case, save herself) But instead she merely grates, and makes one wonder, are all pro ballerinas really that stupid? Her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor, innocent, young girl from your grasp, with an ever present, biting artistic director/villain.|1
"To start with, I have done some further research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film. Secondly, This was a very low budget film, created in the Rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was attempted is an actual jewelers. The producers of Rififi asked them to film their, surprisingly, (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, ""surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop)."|1
It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film ! But do not think I am making any claims for the quality of this movie and if so why is this movie worth the cost? I will admit I love it so I am just trying to justify the fact I have a few ideas but it doesn't seem to make much sense to me I know but I have no idea what is the reason behind what I am making. I have some ideas but it would be better to know why I have to pay this money if I do not rent it..|0
This movie was terrible . The acting was awful . The script was awful . What was even worse were the visuals . I have not seen this film and I know of no one who has done it . This was so terrible . I would never have expected to see it . The dialogue was really bad . The dialogue was so very bad . What was really bad about this movie was the acting was terrible . The dialogue was absolutely horrible . What was actually worse about the ending to this movie than the ending? I mean, in the ending . . .|0
Without saying how it ended, it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end. If the standard had been maintained throughout, the movie would be worth a seven.One wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast. (Well - not really!) The premise is a good one The situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done, but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end, or as a previous contributor said, they changed writers and handed over to someone else.|1
When this series aired I watched most of it . I think it was supposed to be a long running episode and not a short one, but some of them came out right and I'm really liking them. I was so pleased with everything I saw that I just couldn't wait for it to start. If you want to read the rest of the episodes you'll have to check out what they're about. They're all amazing, but I want to try to keep the ones I like the least, but I don't know how I'd like to get there!|0
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I didn't want to watch it, but I loved the movie- It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometime.They portrayed the USCG very well, it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be appreciated more.Not only did it teach but it was a really good movie. The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around.|1
first off , i 'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. This is the kind of thing that was never seen before in this movie. I am very much glad to get this, as i think that it will make for an awesome movie to see. I hope that you have enjoyed it and will be able to continue to watch it when it hits theaters. I have already read everything about it, and I hope that you enjoy it. This is the kind of movie that I was expecting to see, but had no idea how I got there.|0
Boy Oh Boy, does this movie stink. This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Please, even if your life depends on it, DO NOT, and I repeat: DO NOT under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage. Only watch this thing when it comes on as a MST 3000 Episode. That was the only way I could sit through the whole thing. If I had to watch it without that show, I would've stopped watching it before it was over.|1
Ah the sci-fi channel . How often do you disappoint me ? Quite often I think , do you ever. For those who are not very well versed in the subject, I would suggest looking into it yourself. I don't always get a bit of a reaction out of this one, however it might be worth your time to read the first part. One thing you have to be careful of is the fact that the author is a good one, even if his work is poorly written and has some minor errors, which can lead to him having a hard time finding an author in the first place.|0
"This was Gene Kelly 's breakthrough , and that alone makes it memorable . Throw in Rita Hayworth as his wife of two years, and it will be the most memorable chapter of his life . As he says, “I can’t live without my husband. ” I could not be more proud of the man I love . ” I could not live without my husband and have no regrets for him. ” He has done what he’s done. I think he’s as great as can be . ”

What's your take-away?"|0
"I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode it said ""To Be Continued"" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. It ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more."|1
Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), decided the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed up their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and moved back to a lake like the one Rachel lived at as a child.They say you can not go home again but this is an ideal rural home with what at first seems like a Mayberry feel. Later the residence seems to be more like the people in Deliverance. Soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces.|1
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema . In the early years of the war, a number of directors had been forced to cut back their production budget to pay their bills . For instance, there was an attempt by the British to buy a number of old American cinema sets in the United States , where they kept the cost down. By this time, the Soviet economy and the military had collapsed , and it has been estimated that the Soviet economy had only grown by three per cent over the course of the 20th century .|0
I am a huge fan of Harald Zwart, and I just knew that I had to see this movie, even though I can't say I'm a soccer fan. But watching this just filled my heart with joy, and I had a great time in the movies watching it.Bjørn Fast Nagell does a tremendous job directing this movie, and even though you notice the main characters are new at acting, they grow with the movie and makes it what it is. Even though it is supposed to be a soccer movie, there is surprisingly little soccer in it.|1
I viewed the movie for a second time on September 30 , 2006 and thought that it was even better, but did not get to review it. It was reviewed on October 26th, 2006 by one of my colleagues and I am sorry that that was not an issue. I am sure there are other reviews, but the review is the most interesting. I will continue to recommend it to all those who can't wait to see it. Thanks so much. I'm very glad that it's finally coming out and I will be happy with the movie review.|0
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie, I'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock fan, to say the least. However when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the film. Williamson is a Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with Cynthia at the behest of the captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always watchable, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clichéd.|1
This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies.|1
I have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot. Started watching this movie by accident...(lazy Sunday afternoon clicking channels to see if anything good was on)...and was mesmerized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Wow! Gut wrenching! Kudos to everyone (have always admired Martin Sheen) but was particularly impressed with Emilio! Excellent job of acting and directing...simply superb! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I'll have to spread the news.|1
"The first time I saw this film I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it aloneand crying afterward. It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there haven't been many since. I can't say why exactly; Larry ""Rain"" Murphy didn't deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy, not so much for what he did, but for the way he did his time."|1
Oh dear! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. I agree this novel of Jane Austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However I must say I was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost.|1
As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it 's not going to contain any historical material' and you don't have to read it again, you have no right to read it. You get into a story that's supposed to be historical, and what's it going to look like with all the historical data in it. After all of this, the only way for you to understand where it's going to go is to have to read the movie for a couple of seconds and look for any historical references.|0
This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row , public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, and even a few of your own films (like The Great Escape), but it is never the best, especially since it’s one of those films that only gets better with age. At least the other films we see are from the mid-20th century, but even then they aren’t as good. You might think that when it comes to film history, we have to remember that some of those films were made in the last 20 years, and were not made before that.|0
"this film was probably the best ""scary film"" i've seen in years. chilling might be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise. if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept. since noone truly knows that answer, you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie. put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable. carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry."|1
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
"Eddie Fischer was simply bad. Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. The song was totally stupid... I think I could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a Grammy. Then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says something to the effect of, ""Don't tell (insert the guy's name)."|1
Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do ! I was appalled . Do NOT take kids to see the movie, for I know you would never do it to your child . Shame on us for saying that . I do know you can do it yourself because you don't believe in God ! As an adult I think you can do the best you can for your child. But you're not being truthful to your own situation. You don't believe God is your husband, and he does NOT love you. That's why you have to be a Christian to make the choice for your children.|0
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey ' . Endless nature footage of an old friend in action. So when the video begins to get interesting, all you have to know is the title. With all the action and excitement going on, it will be easy to get the most out of this new feature. You may remember how I used to sit in the kitchen, waiting for my brother to do something for me, when I first saw him on the news, he just looked at me from the bottom of his glass.|0
As horror films go , `` Rest Stop '' , could have been better in many levels . Director/writer John Kraszewski has a lot of experience with horror movies . He has worked on more than a few horror movies , but there is something about the film that fascinates him so much that it's almost laughable . It is not that horror film is going to make a bad movie but in horror movies it is not the film that is going to make it bad . It seems like the movie is going to be a story in which horror movies make the movie worse and worse .|0
I really hated this movie and it 's the first movie written by Stephen King that I did n't finish and that I hated, because of the fact it 's the title of the novel and the way they talked about how they 're doing the novel, it's not that I loved it, it is that they 're trying to do what the book is, they're trying to do their thing, and now that they've written the novel it's not that I disliked it. It is not that I dislike the movie, it is that I am unhappy because I have been writing it for years.|0
A gaggle of unpleasant city dwellers descend on Le Touquet for a week's holiday. Stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, deceive each other, have sex...Blanc has gathered together a stellar cast for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but to little avail. What should be hilarious is instead at turns tedious and irritating. All the characters are either pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the farcical nature of things, this viewer was left caring little about what happens to any of them.Credit to the always wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard but that's it.|1
`` River 's Edge '' was one of the most disturbing films of 1986 , and for a year that film has been released on DVD. River '' has become one of cinema's greatest and most iconic horror films, despite its lack of a sequel. On April 24, it was announced that the film'''s story will not be known until next year''. The film''s title ''River'' was first released on DVD in 1988 and released in 1989 on DVD in 1995. River '' was also one of the three most watched films in the 1980s.|0
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie, but the important question is why? It has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on, with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. It also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.What it's principally lacking is charm.|1
"One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far: The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.As nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! The cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! And it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. In comparison, the one of the ""Shining"" is funfair! NB: a lot of users think that it is located in the French Riviera! They are wrong!"|1
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the characters or anything like that? it's the only way I know how to make them look like they look like a regular film but I don't like it.I have no clue why there's a lot of gore in the movie and maybe you have a clue, so what's your guess? You're the only person who can tell the truth of what happened but it doesn't matter to me what the other person was like.|0
Riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. Even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise, you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog, nonsensical plot contrivances, and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen.I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his/her career. This was Tommy Lee Jones's turn. Although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames (oops, sorry about that).|1
I loved this movie . My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart . There are not many things we can do . But when it was her turn to write a book about me I found it really fascinating . I felt so lucky . I never thought I would become such a successful person . But every time I write a book, I start to wonder whether it will ever make a turn . I think it will start to turn into something . But if I am the one who doesn't want to write, I can do it.|0
I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and was shocked to discover shoddy direction, awkward dialogue, a lackluster pace, unmotivated slapstick gags and an overall coarseness that permeated the film throughout. Just not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes by the usually excellent Donfeld are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The whole children's book characters doesn't come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job.|1
This movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers.He also loves his mommy . She is a mom to three children . She wants to move into a house in the suburbs, and to go to school with her husband . She loves her grandchildren , and she does not want to live in a house . She still wants to have her own house . She doesn’t want to go back to a normal apartment . She just wants to get married, get a job . This movie is about a man who loves his wife, his kids .|0
The worst film I have seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. The jokes where really poor. The narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about Mongolian history, traditions etc. My co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost.|1
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it. What's great about it is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story is non-existent for sure but with these movies it doesn't really matter. The pace in languid and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it also has a few things going against it. The first thing is that the gorgeous Annie Belle and the handsome Al Cliver have no chemistry whatsoever.|1
"This is definitely a touching movie, and a great expression of Charles Darwins personal struggle. The movie is not only about his struggle to get his book ""the origin of Species"" published, but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. His daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views, something that she as well had to pay for. Een more than him at times.Now, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion."|1
This movie was physically painful to sit through , maybe because ( like many people my age , and younger, i think) most people are not able to sit still at the moment, because their heart rate has stopped and they are just having a hard time. However, when you sit down at your computer , your mind is just getting a bit better and when you think about it and you look at a picture that shows you have an erection, you will come up with the concept of an orgasm. The problem with all of these movies , you can never be the same.|0
"I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey ( like Zach , I 'm from the country , and I 'm from the country , so I can 't find out if there is a link ). How do you guys think we will see it when we leave New Jersey
Thanks again. A:

This is a bit vague. It would appear to be just the movie being filmed in New Jersey, but it is actually quite nice. In fact, it would give you more of a feel to this movie."|0
"""Son of the Mask"" is a terrible excuse of a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" instead. I must say that it is partially my fault, as I agreed to go see it with him. Being a fan of the first ""Mask"" movie (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster."|1
If we really want to get serious and find Osama Bin Laden , then we should take this stinker down a different way. If the man is still alive, he will never be allowed to be in the news. We have a great leader in him. We have a leader that will do everything we ask to prevent that. But he will never be allowed to be the first one to kill Osama Bin Laden. And he has to be killed by the time they reach his house. If they don’t get his body in the car, we’ll find him.|0
"Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense films. There are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films. Not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious (""movie horror helps us deal with real horror"", ""you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre"") and pretty trite. Also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring."|1
Now before I tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these movies even get onto DVD. If I saw this in theaters I would get extremely upset. Bone Eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones. It's the 'Bone eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets.First of all I thought okay well the DVD artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label it looked scary.|1
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off. Knowing this was a blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with a certain expectation. I knew it would be low budget... the acting sub-par... but hoped for a few gems to be sprinkled throughout. If there were any diamonds or gems sprinkled within this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal... or perhaps overacting. As an actor and filmmaker, I cringed often when potential poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances. Yet, I must admit, I could not look away.|1
I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie. The first 1 hour was OK, though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside US. Isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie just drags on like a never-ending story. The screenplay is horrible. As for the actors, very poor choice. Only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles.|1
This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock has starred in . Ben Affleck should stay behind for the part. And it would appear that the part is pretty good too, given how good the director was. However, he’s going to try to do it again and again. You might have to make some comments about which movie he’ll try again, but you won’t be disappointed with that. It was not a bad movie by any means, but I was hoping he would go for it. But for me, it didn’t turn out.|0
"""Black Vengeance"" is an alternate title for ""Ying hung ho hon"" AKA ""Tragic Hero"" (1987). I have just seen this on VHS, together with the first part of the story, ""Gong woo ching"" (""Rich and Famous""), also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called ""The Black Six"")."|1
The concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and How to Make an American Quilt {I think there's a law that Alfre Woodard has to be in all these movies) which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions, and was prepared for a treat. Instead, I felt tricked. They trot out about 40+ characters, and all but two are one-note cliches with no finesse whatsoever. The writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate.|1
Do n't get me wrong , I assumed this movie would be stupid , I honestly did , I gave the idea to the producers for the release, they did not do so , it will be just as stupid as the movie if not as bad , so if I can get the chance to review it , I will . And I would enjoy it if they could get that for me if I do , I would . That’s a funny story. It’s an entertaining story and not a silly one at all.|0
While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film, it is not however this that lets this picture down. Rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is diminished still by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege.|1
OK, most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it's also a different movie in its own right. Don't get me wrong, 'American Werewolf In London' is a superior film, but 'American Remake In Paris' is a decent movie as well.First off, the only real similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS, and WEREWOLVES. Other than those 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands apart fairly well on its own with its special blend of humor, action/adventure, and horror.|1
Have you ever read a book , then seen the movie , and wonder-How did they screw it up so bad ? I think I saw the movie . I have been following you for the last 5 years . I have been working on it . You may have heard that you know about it but don't know this . What I would like you to know this : *********** *********** , that is what you think. If you want to know what happened and how, then do that .|0
Down at the Movie Gallery , I saw a flick I just had to see . It looked like a good idea but as I mentioned in the book, I had no idea what a film would look like or why it looked like a movie. I was a little scared of the look of a movie in a new movie. I was worried that the movie I was looking into would be one I had no idea who was looking at it at the same time. If you look at movies, you'll probably see the movie the movie is looking at but not the movie that's being filmed.|0
A tedious effort from not-yet great director Budd Boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress Nina Foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a certain kind of B movie. It's just not the good kind. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted.Basic plot -- Nina, a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather, and realizes he's in the dream, even though she's never met him before.|1
Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story has the Japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that MacArthur had dumped into the Manila bay.It's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's War in a not so subtle montage). The performances are just adequate at best. Jim Brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed.|1
"`` Ahh ... I did n't order no amazing hit show '' ..... '' We 'll you got one ''

You've seen them before, what do you think I am? We can't do one, but I'm sure we could. We'll have to work out a deal between us. We've got the right person. I'll tell you - if it's OK for us to go that route - what we're about. I'm willing to pay you, but I need you to come out there and talk to me, I'm willing to give you a lot of credit."|0
Wow -- this movie was really bad! You talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. The plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. Even then... The amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. Are all of those images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie.|1
Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. I mention him only because there is an actor in Death Machines who looks JUST LIKE HIM playing the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate.|1
"As someone who was in a Pan-Hellenic sorority, I wasn't sure what to expect when I tuned into this show. After seeing so many over dramatizations in ""made for TV movies"" and the craziness of the reality shows, I was curious to see if Greek would be able to show the true College and Greek life experience.I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show was able to give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the ever-familiar characters of this genre, but it was also able to add depth to the characters. Greek life isn't just about parties and petty conflict."|1
I thought the movie was sub-par. The acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It was not James (jim) or Tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things go down hill and Jonny Cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. After that the movie could not recover. The deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - I even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene.|1
It may be hard to explain how , but this film is a masterpiece . Perhaps , because i never see the film , it will never be released , I would like the release . I would love to try to create a video of the movie , but . . . i hope to have a picture and a movie , maybe some of it ? . This is the first film of the new trilogy . The first film was released on 17 June 1997, with a sequel in December 1997, which was delayed for over a year .|0
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs , watermellons , people , etc . they are the first ones who use them to cook food , especially meat. If you are not a butcher but you have a knife on hand, they will be very difficult to cut. Also, they are the first items you will need to use as food, if you take your knife out or cut them. One of the first things you can do before using them is to try and clean them and try to get the best out of them.|0
I really don't know why I'm writting this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me say this:When I first get done watching some movies, I like them. Then as time goes on, my opinion changes about the movie. this happened with End of Days. I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was entertaining. But, a few weeks later, my opinion has changed. So, to resolve this, I watched it again at a friends house. Well, it's bad.I'm a logic person.|1
OK , so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid . However , I think there are some interesting differences that I do not agree with and that are worth noting here . I don't know about Karate Kid , but I do not like to believe that there is a great deal of history and tradition behind their name . If this is the case , then why do I even think there are any parallels to Karate Kid , but not with their own names . This is the second article in this series in the series in order to clarify some of the differences between these two different names .|0
"Dreadful, stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. A member of the college's English Department can only sign his name with an X.When it appears that a straight laced Senator (Victor Moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish Bob Hope character.Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the part of Maria in 1943's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls? ""Naturally, the corrupt officials along with Hope try to show pictures of Zorina with Moore so as to ruin him politically."|1
"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a police officer

He's not wearing any pants, and that's what he does when he's drunk. His face is a blur. It's not his skin that looks so bad. His black hair has begun to fall, and it's looking like it's starting to rain. He can't see anything behind him, but maybe he can. Maybe he can do something that he can't do while intoxicated. Maybe he can take his clothes off."|0
"WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie in titled ""Scarecrow gone wild"" could bring me back, so here I am.With that being said, I like to start off with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad."|1
"I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was billed as the ""world premiere"" of the movie by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it previously). I have to say, I still don't really know what to make of the movie. I am unfamiliar with the book, purchased the ticket only two hours beforehand and had only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, as I had problems getting into the movie. The movie is sometimes being narrated by Jones' character but somehow that perspective did not fit for me."|1
"Man oh man, this was a piece of dog sh#t. I read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store, and thought to myself........ Ah this seems like a half decent movie.Vampires.Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No,no,no way f*cking wrong. Jesus, if only I could gouge out my eyes and not remember this film, I would be happy. The lead actor had THE whiniest, gayest voice ever.Man!It really was bad....""Amandaaaaaaaa...."",""I gotta save my girlfriend...."" F*ck off!"|1
"SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo? Yep, that'll be Elijah Wood again.Ever since the concluding part of ""Lord of the Rings"", Elijah Wood as Frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role. Playing a football hooligan, a psychopath and now a young Jewish American, Wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting. Now, with ""Everything Is Illuminated"" he might finally have achieved this. Playing a role which isn't as radical as other efforts, he truly gets to the soul of his character."|1
"A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on ""Dante's Inferno,"" there is nothing especially clever. Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. This film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to High Art.I suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked."|1
Movies are something you see on Saturday night and forget by Sunday morning. Motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the type of thing that should win Academy Awards, a brilliant, visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting. Instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on Earth, the day he tried to lead the Japanese military into rebellion in the name of the Emperor.|1
"Wow, I swear this has never happened to me before. I only watched ""Golden Temple Amazons"" yesterday and already I haven't got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. That's how brilliant this movie is, I guess! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers  especially Jess Franco ones  and I still haven't learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences."|1
Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. In fact this might even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I daresay I might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad Hollywood thriller had I not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic.|1
Everyone's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a stake in the film or had friends/family who had a stake in the film, and that's okay - if I'd made a movie, all of my family and friends would be in there complimenting it, too. In all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, the bad things far outweigh the good. Good: The overall plot was mildly interesting. The music was overall pretty good.|1
My Mother Frank begins as a warm, amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile Frank has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill).Matthew Newton is utterly disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character's uptight.|1
"As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"""|1
Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that's the trick. hey folks - SHOCK - it's an X-File.To me - it's cool that Scully/Mulder have almost no scenes together -- they have to adapt, rely on each other's intrinsic sense about what's really going on - and each other's adaptation skills. They read into each other's moves and get the job done.... (sort of).Oh yeah --- really good acting -- do these people get paid to do this? Or- a slow day when the convenience store doesn't call them into work.|1
I don't leave IMDb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. I fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. Formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. And that was in the first five minutes. Scene by scene it felt as though I'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. The Tori character... bad bad acting.|1
There wasn't much thought put into the story line on many fronts. This is a good action movie but that's about it.- The movie states that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do. How does this protect the vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires from? The uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants.- My understanding is that vampires are immortals and don't age.|1
This is a film that has to be taken in context . It should n't be seen unless you 've been looking for it . We are trying to see if they can understand the world , how we live and what we can have for Christmas . If you have not yet found it, then just have a look around . You may need to take it to the cinema and let us know about it . If it can't do that, I'm going to come and play it, and if it does, we will be waiting to be given a Christmas gift.|0
From the makers of Underworld , we have , by far , the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen , and it has to be seen to say that I have made a very important decision in my own life when I first saw this creature . First, I was going to call myself a Werewolf by name. I wanted to be honest, but I was not ready to be that kind of human. I had to be human, and when I told myself (after I had already become a Werewolf) it turned out that I had to be human in order to live.|0
I 'm originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that film. I'm really proud to tell my kids that we have the most incredible films of all time. It's the only film that I know of that I enjoy and that I can't have. It's a great thing to do. I've never heard such a thing in a theater before. Thank you all so much for helping me and the kids out here today and I'm so proud that I'm able to keep it up so I can see every single day.|0
Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love. It doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why. The jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't gel. And the leads are uncharismatic. Lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later.|1
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that's what makes the show great.The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role.|1
"""Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable"", the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze. Closer in tone and subject to a Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion entries, it is stunningly photographed, directed with lurid enthusiasm, and populated with a rogue's gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surreal fable which begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist."|1
For this movie, based off of a TV show, and a serious finale. I thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious. 'M*A*S*H Goodbye, farewell, and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. Unless you really love the series (Like myself) skip this movie.I was a loyal fan of the show Even Stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky, and Dave Coulier, man, that guy hasn't done anything good...well, ever.|1
I watched Love Life on holiday , when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida . It was great to be a part of, but it is hard to explain to you how this was achieved , since it was done in such a way . I am in love with this film . It was a very hard thing , for the most part (for me) and I did not feel like I was supposed to take it in , especially since I felt like it would be better for us to keep doing it .|0
One of my all-time favourite movies . Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time . If I had never seen this movie , I do believe it to have been the best one of its kind in the history of film making. But I'm sure it was pretty good at its time. If I had ever watched it for the first time, I'd be amazed at what I'd seen. But then I would never have been able to have seen the movie without a few tears. This is my favourite of the all time favourite movie, but I wouldn't put it down to anything else.|0
Got the chance to see this at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that this ever bothered me anyway, since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland wasn't a big budget affair, so whilst money helps, it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good.The story is straightforward at first, with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space. Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet.|1
I saw this originally on Channel 4 ( UK ) and it was a fantastic film that left a great impression on everyone and it was such a relief to see this movie. So there you have it! The film was based off the book by Jack London and is very different in many ways from any of the others I've seen here. There was a big difference, and in some ways the difference was huge, but there was a much better chance to watch it in person than to get the film in the theater.|0
"If it was possible to give negative stars I would for this stinkburger.Do n't get me wrong I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a star, it makes no sense in any sense of the term...I just don't care. I'll have to keep an eye on all the others I haven't. The fact that I could put it in the wrong place is a given, but I guess I can do the trick. I don't care, it has nothing to do with the star. It has nothing to do with what you do with it...

You're not the first person I've tried to get along with."|0
One of the commenter 's is wrong . This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he did n't do well . This has to be a very well made film but i am trying to be a good editor and i dont know how to do that except for one thing but this is a really well-written story . It looks very nice and has a lot of story . I really hope that it does not spoil . . i hope you find it funny . Thank you for watching this video . you will never know for sure what this is but i would like to know that it made me laugh to laugh .|0
"High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar

A 30-year-old man was fatally hit by a car after he came out on top of the local race track for the first time when the driver hit him on the head with the rear end of the vehicle, according to the New York State Department of Transportation. The man was not injured and the driver ran off after the crash with his left hand and dropped his right arm on the ground, the driver and the race team said in a statement Tuesday afternoon."|0
I understand that people have different expectations of low-budget , arthouse movies . I also know that John Sayles has a lot of good stuff that we are doing on a budget , but he has a lot of stuff that I think is more exciting to us than anything. The only thing that I can tell you is that we don't spend all of our money on a budget. It just depends a little bit on where that is going to come from. It's always fun to look at the money and see how a little bit we could spend on the movie.|0
"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion."|1
I am very impressed by the reviews I've read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. I couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I'd like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: Mr Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was NOT an Ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball.|1
At the same time John Russell was playing ranch owner Nathan Burdette , trying to free his no good brother John from his debt. He wanted him to pay off his mortgage, get rid of his ex-husband's money and go to a new home and settle down. The only problem was that his brother was also paying back the mortgage and had to move into his own house for the next year. To make matters worse, Nathan and John were still in the middle of bankruptcy. It was a great struggle for them to get the money that their brother had gotten for his debt .|0
What is this!! its so bad. The animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 type game. The actors are awful, they just cannot act to save their lives. I sat through all of this film an then at the end I was annoyed when I realised I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I've not heard of this film, did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to DVD? A girl got shot?! What is up with that, it was just a stupid film.|1
I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of `` Grand Champion '' and they are all very good people. However, when I was doing the show, I had to set up some sort of camera for it, so I tried to shoot some stuff. But I never managed to shoot it without a tripod. Then I tried a camera and I couldn't make any videos with it...  What I was getting at is that I'm still in the ``Grand Champion'' format because there is no camera on the set (not even the Canon DSLR).|0
This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead . There are several scenes where the dead become part of the universe and they become conscious of the world's meaning and purpose. For those who would like to see the world with a focus on what the dead are doing in their personal life, this is the film we will see in Chapter 3 . In addition to the film of the dead being conscious, there are several other clips of the dead as they try to live a life of their own.|0
Now , lissen you guys , I LOVED THIS FILM , though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE SEXUAL WORLD! AND NOW I GIVEN A LITTLE LOT OF LANGUAGES TO THIS FILM!! I want to thank you both for their time, they have allowed me a lot of freedom , for me it is also a pleasure to have them all come together together. Let me tell you how it has been going on this last couple weeks. The only thing that had been missing since last night was this film ,and I am so impressed by what they have done and what they have produced .|0
After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and different film versions of the book I found myself very disappointed with the movie. I had expected a classic drama but that was not the case. First of all let me preface my review with the fact that I love old movies, particularly mysteries and dramas, but not female oriented movies. This probably makes a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. I thought the acting was a bit over the top, but that is very common in movies of this era.|1
A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away ( sound familiar ) , water has become very popular among mankind . Water is found in all kinds of rocks and all kinds of soil , and in a range of different materials . Water has attracted the attention of scientists . As a rule, water contains no harmful elements , as it has no acid in it, and it has no harmful elements . Scientists have developed a lot of theories to understand the nature and origin of water and to find the way to make it safe and convenient for people.|0
I do n't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about , the main thing about the story is the plot. In reality, this is something that you will never get into. It just happens to be more of the same thing : ) There's not a lot of plot that you might expect at this point, so here it is. I think that this movie is one of those movies that feels like it should be something that should happen to you as well as to your wife and children.|0
To start with , I have done some further research on the film . Firslty , Jules Dassin directed and produced by , is the best filmmaker of the 20th Century to have done this film. He has worked on most of the films of this decade. It was released in 2007 as an exclusive DVD . I think Firslty is a master of the subject . In his book, Firslty was responsible for making up the story in a great number of different ways. But I can’t understand why he is so obsessed with the story of his own childhood.|0
I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. It debuted opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Then it did a nosedive. Critics HATED this film. I don't remember seeing one good review. Everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they meant back then but now I do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol.|1

"Big spoiler right here : this film is B ! A ! D ! But enjoy , it 's good for me because the film makes me so happy . The first thing I did was to ask him if I could do this film if you want to make a film like this! And here is the film. So after doing this I have to tell you,

A film like this is great for people who want to make movies

I hope I didn't say that I have to learn a whole lot more than this. This is not the right word!"|0
When watching this movie , with it 's deterministic cause and effect , wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment , can you tell you that it will work well in your office ? I have watched this movie with no problem. I can see that it is very entertaining. I like the fact that its not just a movie, but I like that it shows that its very well done . I have seen a lot of films, I am very excited to see what it has to offer . I want to see what the next step for me will be.|0
"Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local hooker to New Orleans mobster Julie Balboni . But she won't talk about it in front of a court-appointed jury. She is one of eight women who had been arrested in the last few days on charges of aggravated assault, kidnapping, criminal trespass and other felonies. ""I don't want to talk about the details,"" Robicheaux told The Post. Robicheaux said he hopes to see the entire case, not just the evidence. ""The evidence,"" he told The Post."|0
Based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT movie, it has its interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on location in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I can't remember, but it is in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's beautiful, even to me who lived in Colorado for several years.Next, it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors.|1
This is an astonishingly bad action film . I 'd say its primary flaw is that it 's BORING . I was in a bad relationship for a whole long time . The only reason I said that is because I 'm not trying to say how the film 's a bad action movie. It's because it's a bad movie , because it 's one of the best movies in the history of films . I mean, when I said that it was BORING , I meant what I wrote back in my book . But if you think about it , it's not a bad movie , it's a better movie .|0
"If you loved the 1993 (erotic, sci-fiction)cyborg film ""Nemesis"", then you'll love this one. I loved it the minute the Elvis Pompadoured hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot-out. Like ""Nemesis"" its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future. Both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels, to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses. but thats where the similarities ends. The ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them."|1
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today. Horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. The way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. His acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. I will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference.|1
This movie is a disaster within a disaster film. It is full of great action scenes, which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality. Let's see, word to the wise, lava burns you; steam burns you. You can't stand next to lava. Diverting a minor lava flow is difficult, let alone a significant one. Scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie.Even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film. I mean the acting is actually very good.|1
This film was a wonderful romp , intelligent , playful , mysterious , full of surprises , with humor in a unique and unique way . It has not lost any of their originality as a young actor. It has the ability to be a great comedy of the age, but the humor is very different from it . It is funny and interesting , funny and entertaining , and it has a very unique feel that is unique , but it has an originality and a humor of its own . This is a great example of the creativity that is possible with a film.|0
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice, but didn't really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful.|1
"Mikio Naruse 's examination of the lives of three idling , constantly complaining , single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is an interesting one. “I had the best time in my life,” says Mr.

Naruse “I met my family and their parents. My parents died when I was 2 months old. My mother died of cancer when I was 13, and my father died when I was 17. I’d always lived with my mum and my dad, and my sister, and my aunt and uncle. I always had a good time with my brother, his father and aunt."|0
I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies . The more bizarre and imaginative the film , the more exciting it becomes. For example, I find myself being a little creeped out by horror films as a kid. There are films which I can enjoy, I can go to a certain movie store and watch, or even read about. But the best films are either scary, funny, action or just fun! The most fun is to watch, read about or enjoy. You can also enjoy the films one by one .|0
Never having read or seen the Bard's original work, I can't begin to compare this work to his story. So I won't. Instead I will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.|1
Cheap , gloriously bad cheese from the 80 's , the decade of cheese . I watched this one first, at least for a time, and then tried it out at home and then at a cheese shop in France, in the late 'sixties . . . . but it wasn't anything like that, at least to my mind. I had tried the whole cheesesteak's out in the 80 's for about five years. Now I have it back at home. So, the first time I saw that cheese in the store, I didn't see it on any shelves.|0
I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto. the action was a lot better then the first movie because it had a lot more fight scene and it came to u at a faster pace. it was amazing, the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects.the story line is something new to naruto. but it is basically the same as the first movie. in the series u see them fight against other ninjas,but in the movies (1+2) u see them fighting against machine of mass destruction.|1
Well well , at last a view of this underrated flick . But you ca n't find a good copy of a movie or TV show, you have to look around for one , where to look for it . . . You must know this , it's very old , and has not been written for a generation , but it is the same . And this movie is not a good one , but it does bring out the character . . . in a movie . But you can see the movie and find a good movie that works . . .|0
Aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in Indian Cinema. Here is one good example to show how excellent writers, directors and actors succumb to the producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, acting in a movie about a real story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who in reality, is the son of the producer of the film. Hence, he doesn't have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so.|1
"How sad it is when a film as wonderful as ""Jurassic Park"" slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name."|1
I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3 . It 's surprising that equal parts of the two films are a lot of things to be honest. For me, it just had a great sense of the film and it was a great showcase for my own writing and the writing in general. They're not the only people I have been to see them, but I can say for sure that they're worth watching, especially since I can't remember what it was like in the first half of the film.|0
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling.|1
"Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except Tedium city . A low rent affair with no name. But it's all very interesting and I don't want to spend that kind of time worrying about money. I'm starting to look forward to my next article.

"This movie surprised me . The box is misleading , the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the movie is much too high tone for me to understand. But there is something else. I have a question that has been asked. What is it? I've been asking this question for days. The word ""coup"" is what happens when you do that thing. It is what happens to someone who says, ""That's good."" You have to have that word. It's there. And it doesn't happen when someone says it's good to do something and it doesn't."|0
I must give credit to Billy Dee for trying to pull this off . Knowing this was a blaxploitation film, I knew it was not for him, and it's a shame the director was able to do that. I was expecting him to take it and go on with the project anyway. He would have seen it in a film and was impressed by the direction that it was going. It's just not going to work. As an actress/producer you don't get to pick the film and go and see it in a film; you pick it up with a camera.|0
"Jennifer Montgomery's ""Art for Teachers of Children"" is a stunning, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer's seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen captured on film. The lesson ultimately learned here?"|1
"This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny, entertaining, sweet and memorable, it's difficult to decide where to start.From the opening number, ""Rainbow Connection,"" Paul Williams's excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a ""rich and famous contract"" to entertain."|1
This is a magnificent, and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on TV as a little boy, with my throat almost strangled with tears, and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVD.Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie. Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color, or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousness.Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesn't write or come back.The fiancé, Boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic.|1
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-TV movie, it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales--instead of being a mawkish, unappetizing historical romance.Nor is it helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention.It's hard to understand why a star of OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND's caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight.|1
I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was . Once in a while you see some kind of thing. I can see it all at once. A lot has changed over the years and it’s only been in one of my last two years or so. I don’t think it’s all there is to be. There’s also a lot I want to look at but it all just comes back to one thing. I have a feeling there’s not a lot that will make me feel that way.|0
Mr Bean was great fun, i loved it, every episode was really funny, Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role, he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious!!! The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997, which was also pretty funny by the way!! It's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into, this series was a classic for sure, and i still watch an episode from time to time.Mr Bean is well worth a 10/10 in my book, fans of offbeat comedy must check this out.|1
"""Ghost Son"" is Lamberto Bava's best film and, at the same time, also his worst. I suppose that statement requires some slight clarification. It's his best because it's well directed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it's a dull, unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, myself certainly included, wouldn't have been interested in this film judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title."|1

Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al -- manage to survive all those gunfights in which they're outnumbered? I think I've got it figured out. The enemies always miss, and the hero doesn't.Here, Seagal has a pistol and outshoots a half dozen heavies firing at him from a few feet away. One of the heavies has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It doesn't really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns blasting away at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact.And when it comes to mano a mano combat -- forget it.|1
Altioklar 's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles , from the worst to the best . He does not even take himself to be one of the best thinkers of all time , and does it well.

OK , it was a `` risky '' move to rent this flick , but I thought I had nothing to worry about. I was hoping to get a job doing some of the heavy lifting for my family. I had done it a few years back, and had spent $400 more on the movie that night. The money wasn't worth it. When I came back home, I decided to try a new thing, which I don't think I had done in years, but didn't want to put my name in the books.|0

So I'm gonna write a song for each of them, just the songs I like, I just hope it makes me look good in front of the world, I just don't want anything to fall into my lap , I'm hoping it's just a nice cover and I'll just put my head in my hands , it's a nice way to get the show started . . . I'm just asking if anyone has any suggestions or tips .|0
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube . For a low-budget effort , it has the potential of being a movie that has sold well, but I can't say much since it is so under budget. I spent more time and money in the film than in TV in this video, and I think this is one of the first movies I've seen which I could have done. It is probably my least favourite of the horror movies. I just finished the movie in the US, and I have to say I'm a little skeptical of this film as I have seen it before.|0
'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it 's a problem I have that you know you have this problem that's why you couldn't go to a hospital so it doesn't bother you. It's just too much work to do. So I took my time to do it. My name is [inaudible]. I want to help. So if you would like to donate to this charity, I'm willing to give $1,000 to you. I don't know what it is or how much it is.|0
I just saw this movie for the second time . I first saw it back in the mid-90 's as a young boy and my father said, 'Oh I didn't think it would be that bad of an movie.' I was in my thirties, so the only time I saw it was as a kid. I've been reading movies like this on the Internet for almost a year now. I think the most common thing to me is to watch it in the movie theater as soon as I am old enough to make the movie .|0
This production of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is by far the best that I have seen. Although it may not have the production value of some of the more recent adaptations, it does have the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet.Jacobi's portrayal of the disturbed Prince is multi-layered and riveting. His displays of emotion swing from hatred to sorrow, love to vengefulness and everywhere else on the map, but without seeming forced or over-the-top. In fact, some of the more powerful sequences occur when he underplays them, with stillness, soft speech and thoughtful expression.|1
This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long . There was an aspect of film-noir contained in the ending to be the most beautiful one in the movie and not only did there really be such an interesting scene in it which was just breathtaking . There was nothing special about this scene or its story . What made this work so captivating is that it was composed of a large amount of music, so the music went on to play a huge part in creating the ending of the film . One thing about a movie this length is to be a lot more than the movie itself.|0
my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty incredible. by all means, this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen. at first, it was tolerable. it stunk of BAD IMPROV but it was pretty friggin hilarious, despite the scenes being too long & drawn out and the terrible quality (i read $400 budget above... sounds about right) of the film itself.the biggest problem came from the lack of a script; with a background in improv, i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short & efficient.|1
A CBS radio program entitled `` We the People '' assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Van Beke, a German who is living at the apartment building in Vienna. The two men live in Austria with their families, neighbors and business partners. It's not so easy for the refugee to get back to Austria. But in many ways it is a part of their everyday life, not just for them. But the problem has been a part of the refugees' daily lives for the past 40 years. And in Vienna, the refugees have learned their lesson.|0
This isn't a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battallions were formed due to the increasing demand for soldiers as the Soviet Union was taking heavy casualties all through out the war. These battalions consisted of convicts and dishonored soldiers who were given the chance to clear their names by proving themselves in combat. They were looked down upon as scum and were expended easily during combat without much regret, or much honor, on the part of military. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered extreme casualties.|1
"This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie , thought of two or three funny ones , watched one . I think it is just a joke , that is the problem , I think he wants to try something . But it is not enough , he can make one movie . For those who think they can see what the movie was supposed to say, it is:

The first film is a satire , the second is an adaptation , the third is a production . The satire is directed by . The production is a film directed by ."|0
Well , SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea , and despite the mostly negative responses, I think I'll buy it as soon as I finally get another copy. I was thinking maybe I'd wait a little while for my next DVD, but it would probably have to be the DVD. I know if I get one in Germany, I'd wait a couple more days or months for the DVD to arrive. But I'd love it if it arrived. The DVD will only be available to players in the United States on December 20th via the Sony PlayStation Network.|0
Despite the all-star cast , this attempt at epic fails . It comes across as a set of flat cartoonish illustrations. I’m sure that many of you have already seen the series before . But why is it called? That’s a very strange thing . It sounds a bit like a cartoonish design, but maybe it’s just the fact that we see a lot of the world we see through the eyes of a cartoonist . It sounds like this is something we are seeing a lot because it is a set of flat illustration drawings . Anyway, here’s the problem.|0
I 'm rating this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott . I could 've done without the female nudity so I didn't want to have to wear a bra that I didn't get. It would've been a huge benefit in my life. I also think the fact that you are the only thing on the screen is a nice little bonus, but you are really not the only character. You are also the reason you went to work. You were one of those girls I could tell you didn't have the problem.|0
If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli `` Okkadu '' you will find this to be very similar to Telugu `` Rajya N.`` Rajyukka''. The most recent Telugu version is also the one released in June 2008. This is the most recent version. This article is a continuation of our work on how the Telugu version works, and what it has to say about it. It is mainly going to be a little more detailed and detailed but it is also going to be a bit more interesting than this. Here's a quick recap of everything I've said about how it works in Telugu.|0
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books, so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it was to become a movie. But, I liked it. I found myself grinning through the entire movie. I admit that it isn't a great movie but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were perfect as Helen and Johnny. Just as I pictured them. And the town and scenery were just right as well. I recommend this film, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.|1
I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unsettled crowd of people, not helped by a poor decision by the planners of the event, who chose a totally inappropriate short film to precede the movie. And it really threw the audience when Modern Love came up after a light, whimsical short (name I forget). People!!! It was really silly to mix this short with Modern Love - which is a serious drama movie. A film film. So the audience gets the teaser which is a comedy and then...Modern Love. Hmmmm.|1
This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched . It makes Mel Gibson sound so utterly ridiculous it makes you think about how absurd the story is right now. It's very, very clear that you will not like this. I've never been a fan of it so much so I will say it was the worst film in my life, even though it was the best film I saw on the film roll, but I think it's only fair to say that for you it's the best. And that's what I think.|0
"I'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. When I was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're ""supposed"" to sob -- or at least feel ""touched"". Like when Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like when Robin Williams' character (sorry I forgot his role's name) was telling Hunting repeatedly ""It's not your fault"" (oh Lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). I couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters."|1
I was wondering when someone would try turning that whole Matamoros mess into a goreporn pic . Anyroad , here . What the hell does it even matter? I just don’t like it when it’s a dead giveaway.

"Saw this at the video store and thought I'd give it a try. Sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That was it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played ""Noel"", was the most convincing, though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. As the movie went along I kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. Asthetically, it was good."|1
"""Rififi"" is a terrific heist movie, and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since. Jules Dassin had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live---you will not find here the Hollywood glamour of ""Ocean's Eleven."" The robbers in ""Rififi"" don't rob for the thrill, and they're not playing a game. They rob to survive, to pay for their children's upbringing, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The much-lauded heist scene is a nail biter, filmed in virtual silence."|1
I've never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad I had to say something about it.I'm all for independent film-making as the past year has seen of the worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood's showings, the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about. That being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation.The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. The direction is horrible, the plotting is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay away, far away.|1
I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park...or if they have it was not very well. None of the characters are what they should be: Fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris' personality. Additionally, a first person narrative by Fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character. Fanny is not an entertaining heroine, and I would contend that she is not meant to be.|1
An absolute classic of 80 's scare flix . This one is n't like any other as it pits pint-size beers against a beer that has been on the verge of collapse in the past year. To make matters worse, if you're playing for time with a pint and it's time to make the next drink, it might get out of hand. You should have no trouble getting out of hand on the beer, and that's why so many of us have been drinking pint-size beer. Even if you're not as intoxicated as you appear, you should still be aware of this fact.|0
"The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film. I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind  ""why""? Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit. There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation."|1
The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion film directed by Shunya Ito . The series ' star , Meiko Kaji , is released on March 7th 2016 from Shinshin Films Ltd. The series follows a group of male and female prisoners who were sent to serve their time. Each time they return to the same home for the duration of the prison. This is done to show the different ways of serving their time. The series is divided into three categories: Prisoner Serviced and Prisoner Sentenced. Prisoner Sentenced: Prisoner Sentenced is a series of four films by Shinshin Films .|0
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate . My nieces have watched it non-stop since they 've seen it many times, I have watched it several times .I have only seen this movie a few times . But I think that this one is a pretty good one . I am really enjoying it . It is just beautiful . I have to give this movie two stars and I will enjoy it . It 's so cute, but I just couldn't stand it . I'm glad I liked this movie . Oh! So it is really nice .|0
I'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this. This movie is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commenter-- this movie was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it a zero, but am forced to give it a 1.The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made.|1
For a teenager who has never read Austen , this adaptation might be fine . But only for them . And if Austen is a character , then it is the first book of the series . The story takes place over two years ago on a young man who has been brought up on a farm by his parents . But it does not mean that Austen is nothing other than a teen . There is only one character who is not a teen but an adult. But Austen is in fact the story of a young man , whose life has gone on with the family .|0
A killer ( John Karlen ) with a penchant for really bad disguises ( afro wig on a white dude, a red hair on a girl) as he puts it, has turned himself into the kind of anti-socialist he once had been, with a nasty sense of self-dependence. He is so self-confident, and so determined, that he is willing to take it. He is like a cat, and he has no doubt that he will give it a try. So much of it is the result of his own desire, which has been shaped by a desire to be a more human kind of creature.|0
I saw this film in the movie theater. I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It is a Woodward film about one of Second City's Native sons.Everyone knew about Johns history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.But hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.This movie.|1
Well, I didn't know what to expect from 555. Matter of fact, I had never even heard of it until a few months ago. But, being a collector of just about all types of horror I figured I would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.Basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. Anyway, the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. He decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death.|1
Certainly this film is not for everybody---but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period film Ð buy this immediately! Where else can you get a run down of 70Õs fashion, a period vocabulary primer, karate trained hookers, crime, a rap about the TitanicÕs sinking, shoot outs, and a co-star named Queen Bee (watch for her moving crying scene early on in the wardens office!) With a filming style thatÕs a cross between a porno movie/Dawn of The Dead/ and Car Wash, you cannot go wrong.|1
Wow ! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy . If the cheap-looking opening credits are the only thing they have to do to get them to see this film (as it is! ), we should also be looking for this trailer to be a part of the trailer release! We will be posting the video here and the trailer below to get you excited about what's in store! If the movie is anything like this, then this movie will definitely make you excited! If you have not seen this movie, then it is worth watching the trailers for this video!|0
My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count . This is worth seeing for a reason . I have watched it countless times and there are many people who will watch it . It has given me some great insights . It is a must watch. You do not need to watch it . You will see it. So many people watch it now . They know what it is . They are just as surprised as you are now . They think they will see it soon , but not as long as you . These people are so lucky.|0
imagination must of slipped Jim Wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one. i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far. I did enjoy seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert get eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits (my husbands sentiments). Jerri Manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy.|1
Yet again, director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal film (quite a feat for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest. The story is about a retired hitman (Bronson) who lives a cosy life on a Caribbean island.|1
"Originally , the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial , and it shows . I dislike serials ; they have to be very tough , and they usually have to be just the same characters. I don’t think there’s anything special to this kind of thing, but at the same time there is a way to keep the series in a good way, and this is one thing that makes it work, and it’s not just a good thing.”

In other news, we got a new trailer."|0
"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other works were quite good, but I must say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman, who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons. They move into a well-guarded community, yet all is not as it seems; a sort of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see, or not see, things an people. During the first reel, I had a hypothesis, and thought, ""this can't be the whole reason?"""|1
Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following. If you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.Bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. He is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named Cobb.|1
"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman 's writing ( especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in `` The Dream Hunters '' )

After all, it's his first book, and his first time writing, and if you've read so much you'll have found something new every week. In fact, there is one new book on his life that you don't know about. This latest book, written in the late 90s, has been out for more than a decade now, but since it's written so early and there are so many of the characters you've met, why not read it and take a look back?"|0
"This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow-up on. But, I'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show. To have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like ""The West Wing"" or ""Commander-in-Chief."" Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn't act (he was awful in ""Early Edition""). It was a pain to sit through this show."|1
I simply cannot understand how any Who fan, or just plain anyone could find this awful, lazy, poorly written abomination even remotely funny. It is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been great. What a shame that all that acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned.There is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here.|1
"I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.i just finished watching the game and i am a fan of the 3DS so i really wanted to see if there was an update on how 3DS works and the way the game does it.i will be playing this on my iPhone next year and i'm not sure what is so great about the new software ...

My wife is very happy about her new iPad and she says that Apple is looking at the 3DS now. I thought the 3DS would probably be a bit faster."|0
Without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life. Take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a bench.Then add a cheap camcorder. You know the old VHS types that cost £20 on ebay. Add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film. What a shocker it was. They couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it.|1
This film was really terrible.However , it's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. I mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! I haven't laughed as hard as I laughed at that for a long time.There were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that I found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end.|1
"Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch? And I got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is ""different"", someone nobody understands... She is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her. Besides, Brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so... Fake."|1
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkinscreates a film like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (onepre-sentenced the other post-sentenced) throughout the picture. After they're tried by a military tribunal, they have the choice of eitherserving out a prison sentence or they can participate in PunishmentPark (a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but theclothes on their backs) whilst being hunted down by local lawenforcement officers who use the park as a live action trainingground). I can't say enough about this movie.|1
Good old Jess Franco ! The always-reliable choice of director in case you 're looking for undemanding sleaze , shamelessly seductively sex-ed. Jess Franco, the director, is an excellent person to work with. His movies are a pleasure to watch but they are also very good to see and enjoy. The movie is a masterpiece and is one of the most entertaining scenes you can have. This movie has great sex, and it was a huge hit, but that is not to say that it is a must. On top of this movie, I loved it.|0
I have only seen this movie once, when I was about 14 years old, but I was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th, I would like to see it released on a DVD. I may sound a little bias but the 45th Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about WW2 and Korea but you rarely hear it mention the 45th.|1
I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight . I must say , I was excited to hear about this film. I have not had a chance to enjoy this movie. I don't understand why so many people who love this film, even though it's a bit too much. I was going to try to make a post for another movie review on the same topic. Here is a sample of what I can say. I am not getting it right, so let me try to explain it to you.|0
From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat , this is the type of film that has always fascinated me and I’m not saying it wasn’t a great idea to have a great director to work on this but I just think we’ve got a really talented crew that wants to work on it, so if you’re gonna shoot the film you need a decent camera, you’ve got to be up top. Sylvester Stallone has done a wonderful job in this one, as do many others.|0
I rented this one by accident . I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought ``what's wrong'' with the screen! But then I realized that the camera wasn't the one I had in mind. I had seen it before. If you take a picture of the video before you can look at the screen, the picture is the one you just saw. Here are some of the things that I had to try to help. 1. Make an angle out of the camera and then move the screen up and down.|0
As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books ( of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the only one ), I always look to the author to find out what works best for each book. I would love to read a book by an author that has some of their best qualities. If you haven’t checked it yet, click here. My review of my favorite book “Kylin’s Dream” is the most important because it will make you want to read any book by anyone for any purpose.|0
"Does anyone else think that ""Reba"" is basically a ripoff of ""Roseanne""? Just look at the characters from the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who's married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and the quirky relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). And then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor."|1
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending ( or maybe a Crying Game ) that will take you to the real world or even to an alternate world where you can only see things like your friends, your family, your children, your parents, you yourself. You can also see the real world through the lens of the films. I've never seen anything like that but I think I will have to if I can avoid it. I think I'm going to miss it. If I can just avoid the ending, I will get into it for sure!|0
This film is a cash in . A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier film. The film was produced by the Los Angeles County Film Commission (LCF), the same people who directed the first film that ran into trouble with the LAPD’s C-3PO shooting system in the 1980’s, and the first film of the year for which it was made before the LAPD. Film director, actor, and director of the film “Chronicles,” John Lithgow, director of the Los Angeles County Film Commission.|0
This is a low budget, well acted little gem. Alice, a small town Massachusetts teenager, fed up with her existence, takes to the road to escape her mother who flips burgers and her own job as a check out in a super market. She sets out for Florida and to stay with her wealthier high school friend who is a freshman at Miami. After her car suspiciously breaks down on the thruway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in an RV who also happen to be traveling to Florida..|1
The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain ( Jodie Foster ) . Her father and uncle are famous in the ‘90s, so why don’t they want to be there? After years of looking for information on Bain’s past, she’s decided that the only time they can tell her is in the form of a photo or two. A photo taken of Bain at a press conference in New York in September 2015 shows a man at the podium, flanked by his father and a photo of Bain sitting at a press conference.|0
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
"Firstly, this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novella, or anything else. From EW's Web site, and their review on the show when it first aired, ""...he never writes down to his audience, and he never betrays contempt for his subjects. His first original work for television, Stephen King's ''Golden Years'' (CBS, July 16, 9-11 p.m.), is no exception. ""The series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on."|1
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but this a pretty good one. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl. My favorite part though without a doubt is Gene's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time. So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today!|1
Well the previews looked funny and I usually do n't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids, so I had to look them up if I hadn't seen them. And this is really the first time I saw anything from them. They have all the scenes in this trailer and they had to make up a little bit of the dialogue. Oh, that's good, but I would say that they have all the dialogue and they get the story from the actors. But I would like to know where they go from there.|0
The Mod Squad is n't a movie , it 's a void . That 's the most fascinating thing about that movie is that it doesn't even have a story. It's also very rare that there are films out there today that have not had a mod scene. And I think that's true. The mod scenes have a very short life, so there is something there for it to have, if you're a guy who can make a mod scene, and when you think about that you know what the mod scene is supposed to be like.|0
The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. When it's all over ten hours later --- well, it seems like ten hours --- you're puzzling over what it was all about. I don't want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling. There is enough of it in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.|1
"An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants. At the beginning of the film she ""throws back"" the stableboy for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur! The high-toned English set she moves in is such a clichéd bunch of harummpf-ers that it's ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! ""My violeen! How weel I ever play eet again!"" ""Patreecia, my meelk is cold!"" It's campy beyond belief."|1
Do NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. It possibly is the worst movie I have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and I were able to laugh at every single moment of this film. At times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not. Characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly, and the Vampire Assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire.|1
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller . It´s definitively NOT a gripping thriller and the way to go is to enjoy it a lot better than you and your spouse. However, I really don´t feel like it´s a very gripping thriller. I think that I would love to find a thriller with a few good twists and turns if I could. In a nutshell, it´s an enjoyable story and one that you can enjoy even if you don´t make the effort to understand what the protagonist was like.|0
Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense . Unfortunately very little of what we do is done by people who don't know much more than we do. But if you do your research, and you know a little more about the way you do things, you should be able to get some ideas about what the brain is trying to accomplish, and even a little bit of inspiration to help you get the most from it. I think most people think that when it comes to finding inspiration from something, it's more about what they know how to use it.|0
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness. not only was the name a complete misnomer--since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas--but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot. when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. unfortunately i waited until the end in my case. that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim.|1
Nothing will ever top KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink (! ), but KvC ain't quite as bad as I expected for a SYFY channel quickie. Just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned, or while trying to go to sleep. The unimaginative title basically says it all: A group of mostly unknown actors converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables has gone wrong. Giant creatures that came into contact with the vegetables have taken over the island and eaten everyone. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people being there.|1
"A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie . 75+ % entertainment . Casey , Buddy , Kelly Marsh , and I was very pleased with my family movie & its story. Here is the link to a page with pictures and links of all of the scenes in the movie. You can also read some of the movie descriptions and excerpts at the link. This is what I've done to make the movie even better:

There are very few scenes in the film that I've done less than a month ago."|0
My yardstick for measuring a movie 's watch-ability is if I get squirmy . If I start shifting positions and move my position, I know the time it takes to make a move, so I have no way to know if I move. But I don't even have an actual time scale (not that I mind). I just tell it to keep moving and I get what I want. Or else I can get the movie I want. Then I can see the movie I want, but it would probably make me look like some kind of freak.|0
This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as I remember it being.The story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. Ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. The thing I wanted to know throughout was, TO DO WHAT EXACTLY?|1
I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene , soldiers are seen wading out in the river, they are seen being attacked by boats and being hit by aircraft and aircraft. During the bridge scene there is also some fighting going on among the ships that are seen sailing around the river, it seems that they are heading to their ship. Some time ago I read that a ship is coming to a land of water and at some place the ship was seen to be standing with her bowsponding to the ship as if it was in the water.|0
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey ( producing and starring ) has worked on, yet there is one thing I am very excited about. It is a very fun and entertaining film to see, and Jim Carrey is doing well on the technical aspects of it, it was a pleasure. The film was quite good, and it was a bit difficult to watch from the stage, which I really enjoyed. I think that it was quite enjoyable to watch from the back of a chair, and this is definitely the first I’ve seen it from a real stage.|0
The movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TV's early years. Nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful.|1
The movie is nothing extraordinary . As a matter of fact , it is an insult to the horror genre, the horror of the movie (as the title suggests) and I'm sure you'll agree that it is a disaster . There are so many ways to play the genre in the theater , which are different from the actual horror film industry , that there are a lot of different styles . There is a lot of variety in what the theater is made for , and what the theater may or may not be used for .|0
"A man kicks a dog 2' in the air.A woman kicks a cow out of her bed.A man kicks a violin down the sidewalk.A woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds.A man kicks a blind man in the stomach.Jesus rapes a young girl.There you have it. I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those to whom this ""shocking vanguard of cinematic expression"" would appeal. But I found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade."|1
I was really beginning to enjoy this show . It just started out slow and it was n't given the right format for it, so it's kind of what I want to do . However, it took a bit getting used to , but I do have a few ideas for a good, easy way. I'll probably do it in a few years time , I'm not even sure about that . I'm just wondering if someone could take a peek into my show so I might get some insights into it .|0
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen . it is a tight slap across the screen , i mean i would be very much against it if it were released in cinemas, if it was an actual movie, but i don't know why this is not considered a film or a film by the best film production companies . I think this film is a good film, but it seems to make it sound like a rip-off of some sort, a movie that was produced before i had even started looking for the release date .|0
The story is about a psychic woman , Tory , who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic experiences . The incident occurred on Saturday, June 12, 2018 when Tory was walking down a deserted street in St. Catharines, California, on her way home from work. “My family is not coming home,” Tory told me. “My mom’s in the hospital when she’s going home. I can’t understand how people would come to her, so I just told her I could come home and see her. She started crying.|0
Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film ( except note that it needs to be made in Germany). In the first half of this book, in the course of a day, I found myself thinking (and actually doing) about what I felt was wrong with the film, and what I could do to help it. It was also, in my experience, very good. But it wasn’t so good that I didn’t think it was something I should take a step back and think a lot about.|0
Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August . I was so inspired and touched . Harry Potter and Harry Potter movies have been the most popular of its kind , even though movies are usually not released for mass release . I just did not know that this film was being released . That's why I started looking for some films that might be released and to find out more about film production, we have a link . Also . This movie is the second film from this series. But it is the first film of this series and it was released in 2012 .|0
Oh how awfully this movie is ! I do n't know if it is a horror film or a drama. I mean it's not too big or big at all. I have read the DVD, I watched it and I can see it in every single movie, even when I have a bit more time on my hands to read it, and some of the things you would not expect of a film. But it's something I can read, I have watched and I will watch it and read it.|0
Chick Flick? Of course.... Been done before? Many times.... Predictable? Yes..... Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. I am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development. Although this is not the BEST of its genre, I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.|1
It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa!Wow. What a skin peeling bad movie. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.... Just some things to point out...1) The incestuous lesbian mother-daughter exchange was weird. I do need counseling now.2) There is no God, there is just Dude.. I love that quote from Crow.3) Whatever did happen to the Nuns that took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a horrible emptiness in my stomach.4) Lastly, don't watch this movie un-MSTied... It has Joe Estevez as the main star.. Yikes..1/10 for un-MSTied 8/10 for MSTied.|1
Horrible acting with the worst special f/x I 've ever bore witness too . It 's bad enough I wasted so much time . What the hell did I do on my way to the hotel this morning? I was in a car and I thought it was going to drive me to the hospital. I thought it was going to be an accident, too. I couldn't see anything as it went by, or the car pulled over. No lights, no alarm system, no lights in. I walked to the car and got in the way.|0
From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. Lets put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought 'I can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. The acting in this film was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place.|1
What I hoped for ( or even expected ) was the well known `` stop motion '' imagery and extreme endorphin levels from the early 20th century.'' I did not see that I would see the endorphin increase until around the '30th century however, and then I just assumed it would not increase until the early 2000s as it had done at the end of the 1990s. However, this is not how it is now, and I think we have to give it a try. What was the idea behind the 'Stop Motion Imagery'?|0
I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster . It was one of the few high-profile movies on the internet that I’d be willing to share. After the trailer, the first line credits were removed, and I was left wondering: what kind of film was this? I have many questions. One thing I noticed about the movie: the actors, actresses, and crew, and I am not really sure who or where the actors are, but the set is pretty big. As such, some of these are my favorite actors.|0
This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film . Billy Dee plays a young white man who has an affair with a black man he loves, but he is not the only one . The only thing that matters more than he is white people is their love for his white people . They love him. The only way to get him out of prison is to kill him . And if you do kill him, it is only because you hate him. . This is, of course , a classic.|0
It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover.|1
This is a classic continuation to Bleu, the likewise excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the very end. But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England.|1
Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion. What makes this film so unsettling is that the drama feels so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's only a movie. This is by far Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman's performance of their careers. The film almost feels like a theatrical production the way it is staged and lit. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's very difficult to get a copy of it. I have yet to see it other than on Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special edition treatment on DVD.|1
A couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of the first areas of the mall I visited with. This is where I started. The first location is where I first learned that it is possible to walk from one side of a building to another. I had been there before, and had learned that this is where I needed to be. I remember walking into the mall in the late ‘90s and thinking ‘I have to move this building, so I have to go somewhere else.’ But it wasn’t that far away.|0
Oh my God ... where to begin ? `` Chupacabra Terror '' is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. After a few scenes, it can be seen as a bad thing, so I've started with it as a whole. The first two scenes in the movie are in which the B-horror director is trying to kill an alien, as shown in the first scene. The second scene, in which we see the aliens come back to life, is about to be seen again but not as part of the first scene since the second scene, which is much better.|0
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film . Incredibly bad . Very pretentious . It would have been very easy to sell it for a lot of money, but I am not going to spend a penny . . . . It’s not the film that I would like, but it’s a good film. If you were in the market for a big blockbuster, it could have sold for very little money . . . . It would be very easy to sell a movie and it would not do that.|0
When the noble Hanabusa clan is decimated by the usurping Samanosuke clan, loyal retainer Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with his lord's eight year old son, Tadafumi, and his daughter, Kozasa. They are sheltered by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the Hanabusa clan's god, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the giant stature carved into the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek vengeance against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured in the attempt, and sentenced to die.|1
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination, dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts.That was not the case when I watched Bakjwi, under the American title Thirst. Now playing at select theaters near you. Seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details. There WILL be blood in this film and you WILL try to look away.For rest of review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above.|1
I never read the book . Now I do n't really want to . I had no clue what this was called and it would be like . . It sounds like the same story . So what I've read, is that we're in the third act. I think that there's a difference between the story and the story itself and what the characters are telling them. I think the story is the beginning and the ending, and what we are doing is, I think that the book is the end because the book is the beginning and the book is the end.|0
This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in some way that life and work are a lot of work. And I’m all for it. As I’ve read the entire book, there are many examples of movies which are more than enough for you to take. But this is one example of what I hope that you will be watching. It seems that the average American is currently obsessed over the movie they are watching every week, but I’d like to hear how it influences their daily lives.|0
One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way : I was sitting in the car and the sun was shining out. I was looking down the long driveway, and every time I looked back I was in the back of the car. I could see the reflection of the car and the lights of the house, like the headlights. That's it! I was in the driveway and I stopped. I thought to myself, “Wow! I can't believe that this could happen, can't it?|0
OK , this movie , was the worst display I have seen in years . The actors were n't to be the same. And the movie has been shown many times before on television. If it is a great movie , it should be seen again . I had the impression that we had seen this movie in a movie theater and when we saw it in person we knew they were real. But the real movie is a movie that can't be seen and it is hard to compare them to the real ones.|0
The only reason i didn't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on it...the only and i repeat the ONLY effect that they used is a weird kapoera (from India?) jump on a half meter wall/trash cans, i mean, effects doesn't make a movie but... sheesh.... me and my friend hoped the entire movie for some real effect (a huge wolf?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo... all we got is a jump! on a 0.5 meter wall + they used pharmacy's ..... and they found guns?!|1
Why would I say that? Because when the movie ended, I was in a good mood. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe he learned how to act after the sixth sense, you must be very new to his career. He won an emmy for best actor in a comedy series before he did Die Hard. It's like saying, wow, the sky learned to deposit snow on the ground just because it's your first winter in life. The movie was hilarious.|1

Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on a cross-European tour with some unlikely associates.Liev Schreiber makes his directorial debut with a playful angst usually associated with his acting ethos. When successful actors decide to sit in the director's chair, we usually get a biographical glimpse at the souls beneath the acting mask- Check. We usually get a mishmash of genres- Check. But what we normally do not get is an insightful original film which is credible, intelligent and moving.Elijah Wood plays Jonathan, an inquisitive young boy who collects pieces of life as he goes.|1
The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector BAbenco's powerful message. The film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.The differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people.|1
"**May Contain Spoilers**The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced ""dee-SAYd"") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. He routinely beats mute servant Anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. Inadvertant laughs are provided by giant ""Nubian"" slave Mantis who talks with a Deep South accent and helps de Sade hunt down trespassers in the style of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME."|1
We 've all got to start somewhere , it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like us did a good job and then all the others like us just kind of fell back on it . And I've always been very proud of what we've done for them . And it just makes it really hard , to even think of doing that . But , you know what I've done . I've had a lot of fun with the last two movies . It's been one of the biggest changes I've done for the last year .|0
"I saw this film when it premiered in LA . I think I laughed 2 or three times . The last time I laughed at this scene was at a performance in New Orleans . It was like a horror movie. It was scary . I don't know if it wasn't scary because the first time the film came out in theaters it was really scary . It was scary . . it scared me and I thought, ""I know this isn't scary but I did what I thought I was going to."" And then after a couple of nights, it was crazy ."|0
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Brett ( A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell ) Piper. It’s a little over four minutes long, but it will get you to work through the scene and figure out all the things you need to know. When we first heard about it on the podcast, we wanted to know how the game worked. It’s a little over four minutes long because the trailer is a bit short and the story was really short in the main story, so we’ll have to wait until it’s on the screen.|0
You 'll feel like you 've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible movie, all because you had to sit through it so many times before it finally got to the stage and you 'd get this feeling you 'd never get into Hell.' Now I know you 'll be thinking, I don 't care about this movie if you 'll believe it was made because you didn 't put it up in there, it just felt like it 's like it 's the end of something. It 's time we got started again.|0
Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport.|1
If there are people that don't like this movie, I don't think they are human. This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I have seen and really the film that Judith Light has starred in to make me a huge fan of hers. This movie, although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me!|1
I did n't even watch this whole movie . Now , I like 50 's sci-fi movies even when they're just bad , but I can see a big difference , and there are a lot more sci-fi movies I can watch when I go to see some of the movies that I can enjoy. So it will be interesting to watch some movies that I really can enjoy now. I don't think it'll be the best experience I've had with a movie that I actually want to see now, so let me know if I can watch the movie at least once or twice .|0
"I love these awful 80's summer camp movies. The best part about ""Party Camp"" is the fact that it literally has no plot. It simply drops a weak batch of ""characters"" into a location and then things occasionally happen. The cliches here are limitless (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. The only cliche missing is the presence of Corey Feldman."|1
The Priest, into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious, but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost, but decided to leave human alone. Fragile, but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire, that far beyond priest, and salvation. Also I thought about love.|1
"I love old ""monster movies"" for the pure camp value. This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. You do get used to it when you've seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. You're just there for the giant bird.The ""science"" in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to Earth to nest."|1
"Philistines beware , especially American ones ! This has all the elements you 'll hate - a langorous approach to life , and an ability to do all that you need to work towards a better life :)

I've been writing about the things that I think are most important in a society - the things that bring us the most joy. What I am trying to get out of it is that we need to be there for each other - when we're in the right emotional state, when we are in the right relationship - when there is a bond, when love is present."|0
"Follow-up to 1965's ""My Name Is Barbra"", and shot in brilliant color, ""Color Me Barbra"" has La Streisand alternating nostalgia, clowning comedy, feminine romantic angst, and beguiling seriousness for a crazy-quilt hour of show-biz razzle dazzle. She's a cut-up and a femme fatale, a sprite and an enigma. With her Egyptian eye make-up and ever-changing hairstyles, she's also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and moving, even if a few of her songs are not (""One Kiss"", ""Yesterdays"")."|1
"""The Planet"" is an astounding piece of film making. For a mere £8000 Stirton Production have turned out one of the most original sci-fi films for a long time.Starring the physically intimidating Mike Mitchell, the film is a mix of great special effects, strong storytelling and well planned action. From the opening space battle, to the pounding finale, everything about this film appears well above it's budget.To start with the special effects, while certainly not ""Revenge Of The Sith"" standard, they are on level, if not above, the likes of Babylon 5 and Farscape."|1
"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years..."|1
I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid , waiting for Dr. Who . I had the chance to go to one of his concerts and listen to him tell a story of the night before. He has a great voice and always makes me want to go there. He always tells me what to do when I feel like I can’t do anything else and I’m sure that when I find him again he can help me. So I hope that I will have some fun tonight.|0
Significant Spoilers! This is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.I do know that I will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch.|1
At the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'The Final Executioner'.. at least where I come from. A bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. Lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. Has one of the weirdest array of costumes I've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. GREAT job on the dubbing too guys(!)|1
Barely came trough the whole movie ... Acting is bad , dialogs are even worse . Felt kinda st00pid 4-bit. I find that the quality is good but for me, it is not good enough. I don't think it is very strong enough. What you're seeing with the movie does not really make any difference whatsoever. I have the feeling that you're still in the same mindset as me (and I'm not saying it isn't true) but, you don't have to worry about it when it's playing the game.|0
Wow , I swear this has never happened to me before . I only watched `` Golden Temple Amazons '' and it was such a great honor to get this book published. I would like to get it for my birthday but I can't because of how many people have died since I read this, and it was not good. I have never read anything by Golden Temple Amazons. I will have to get the other books because I don't know what to do with the next one. Thanks! Hi, I am having trouble understanding your title.|0
I was surprised to like this movie since I 'm from the `` check your brain at the door and tell you what. When I first got my camera I thought it was just a film of a guy who just wants to make money. Now I think that's really cool. I 'd love to learn how to make a movie and it's not just about making money. I like to learn it and when it's not working its just a movie. I like that it can actually be anything. It could be anything. Yeah, I love that movie too.|0
I believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of Darwin, pro and con. I would say the real man is depicted here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie. This is deep movie, a pondering of modern life and the way we think, and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts (and other who used him) have certainly affected our lives.|1
it 's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is ,and how many people believe that you should be on the right side of the law when you're not . I think we've reached the bottom . And as I see it, I think it's a little unfair to say that that's what I'm thinking, but also, I think we need to take a hard look at this situation . If that's the case, then we're in trouble . You know what , . . you're not in trouble .|0
Ok , when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations . Yes , the acting is not very good , but the music is great , and the lighting is good. ive been looking into the DVD's and everything, and they are all very nice. All in all they were a blast to buy and the music is great . If I had to pay more to rent it I would use the money from other sources , especially for the time , but the music is very good . I just purchased this last week, and had the worst expectations .|0
I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.I saw this film on TV, i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first, probably , 10 minutes, but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me, it is a real spine chiller.The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect,u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to.|1
Not a balanced point of view. The director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. The movie has some criticism of Fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. So few critics of Fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views. But that is not the case.The movie barely shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the MRTA insurgents that took the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning.|1
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and plot aren't that impressive, but the lines just keep on coming. This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like, well, a bad movie, but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... I was especially fond of Sharon, the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However, the one that really stole the show was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden), his high pitched whining was somehow endearing.|1
Never having read or seen the Bard 's original work , I ca n't begin to compare this work to the new one . It does not seem very original and has a lot of fun to play. It is very much a game that is not designed for a 3D shooter. I would love it to be a game to play in any style and not one that would require a 3D experience. It does not seem to have a very unique design but I would really like to have something like this for my family to play, or for people to play around with for some time .|0
I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created. The story here is not something I would consider to be a strong point in the game universe. No worries though as in typical Boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection.|1
Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash, some knowledge of movie making, a mixed bag of aspiring actors, and a lot of determination, yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than a fairly poor looking After School Special (in a bad way, not a nostalgic good way). I mean this is so-so quality home movie / student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free. Thankfully, I found it in a discount bin somewhere.|1
Following a 19th century gun dual that goes awry, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does she become one of the undead, she uses her goth, temptress persona to sustain her talents as a cold blooded assassin. This is a low grade B feature that should have went straight to video. The violence is vicious and gory, but actually quite mild. The story line is so weak and dialogue so haphazard it is hard to work up much interest. Eileen Daly is the lead character Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth, and Isabel Brook.|1
If any movie ever made Italians look bad, this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A--HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I s--t on your grave. Seeing as practically every person gunned down in this film by the cowardly Mimi is either black or of some other racial or ethnic minority, it's hard not to become convinced that the guy ultimately owes his allegiance to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads. Awww, but he doesn't shoot the little black kid in the elevator in the opening sequence, so that means he can't be all bad, right?|1
It seems to be a common thing in the 90 's to play with cliches . Some manage to do it quite well. In this post, I will walk you through how I set up this script to run. I have already put together the script below but you can find the part where I run it above and the parts where I have done some other things. The scripts are not set up correctly. They are running a script that does what we want. In the script below, I ran this script. It runs all the other things below with no problems whatsoever.|0
This film is just another waste of time . The plot is ridiculous , forced USA drama . The characters are awful . I was just looking for an interesting film to explore the world with and I was not surprised by the results . The film was made with the help of two directors and that's why I am so intrigued by this one . I just love this film , because it is so realistic , as well as very funny , and I like its acting . The performances of the actors and crew are excellent .|0
"This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series . I did not realize that I was the main character. I have no idea why I was this way. I think it is because it is not clear what a Left Behind movie is, and the movie is not what I am looking for. But it does say something like:

    A movie with a different plot
    It starts with the same story line but has different characters. But why does the movie contain three separate characters and not two and three? Is it just me?"|0
After reading some of these reviews, it is apparent that some have missed the point. What is great about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is astonishing about this film is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self. These are just kids doing what kids do - without consciousness. We all went to school with kids like these.|1
"Oh , there are many worse Wayne movies . This movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element in it. I am hoping for better scenes to go with it. And if not , I don't care about any of the bad movies in it . If it's going to go bad , this will be it. If it isn't , I don't know what we'll be going to get for it

A few years ago I saw a movie with the same title but with a much darker cast ."|0
I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher, but it was an interesting one. There was a lot of controversy at the box office over how they chose to describe Kevin and Ashton Kutcher as the same person. As you probably know, Kevin and Ashton made the decision to name each actor on the basis of their performances, which might have been the case, but if you take the opportunity to think through the details and the implications, you get some very important information.|0
My Take : Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller , even a thriller in a romance. He’s got a great idea for a new thriller, and he has one, which is about how he feels about his daughter’s disappearance. There are four main characters: Steven, Claire, David, and Jo, as well as all the leading actors. I think it’ll be nice to play both of them, although it does take a while to get through it all, because the character development takes longer than you might think.|0
Imagine if you will : four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in the USA, and then I will give them free tickets to attend, free tickets to take away from their own school, free tickets to take away from your own school, free tickets to make a movie, free tickets to have sex with other teenagers, free tickets to get a tattoo and some other things you have no idea what you are doing. My students have already paid for them and they can have them back in about 3-4 weeks.|0
Last year, I fell in love with the Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and I found this one at the library. Though I think Burton's is best, probably because I like film a lot better than theater, this is still a great production of the story. I haven't seen any of the other versions but I am trying to get my hands on them.After seeing Johnny Depp as Todd, it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role, but George Hearn does a fantastic job.|1
Every time I've seen this movie I get the same impression: some parts of it are so amazingly stupid/bad that they crack me up, they aren't intentional, and there are a lot of them; the rest is just plain bad, stupid and/or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result-it' stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do. This movie doesn't have that excuse, it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably.|1
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. The big mama's of day are under the age of 55. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past.|1
"As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was listed as production manager on this film... my very first! As a matter of fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Watch carefully, and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes, as a soon-to-be-murdered asylum attendant named... ""Cely"" (my own last name).Originally titled ""Hostages"" this picture was changed to ""Another Son of Sam"" by the Producer-Director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time."|1
Scarecrow Gone Wild starts as high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) & his mates decide to to give a 'hazing' to wimpish diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as an initiation of some sort. Mike & his mate decide to take Sam to a corn field, tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow & leave him there all night, sounds like fun right? Well, things backfire when Sam goes into a diabetic coma after suffering from a hypo & the vengeful spirit of Sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life & starts to hunt down the kids responsible for Sam's unfortunate life-threatening predicament.|1
"I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old. Only ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" holds up this well, performance-wise. As someone that has seen heroin addiction first-hand, I was shocked at how realistic this film was. Frank Sinatra's performance is completely uncompromising, realistic, and heart wrenching. Otto Preminger's direction is perfect for the film, with long takes and a very mobile camera.Kim Novak's performance is good, as is Eleanor Parker's. In fact, the entire supporting cast works very well, with understated performances, as befitting this film's style."|1
"I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I was hoping it would end.It had a promising beginning; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days (and Years) together in ""Separate"" beds in hotel rooms) is just not believable. He does kiss her somewhere along the way, and she feels Ohh, so terrible about it. Very little substance to grab your interest. The acting just does not hold up. He is very passive."|1
Although I rarely agree with filmkrönikan , I have to say that this film while not awful , just did not have a good cast. It did have a very good cast of actors but it lacked some of the actors well and not enough of them to give a picture. I did not watch it for the best chance to find out what went on in the theater, or if anyone knew of someone who did it. If I had to do it on my own , I would be in a good place to buy a good film and I would be very glad if this was a good film.|0
"I spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see""."|1
"Like another poster mentioned Ch. 56 (a local Boston TV station) showed this multiple times over the years on Saturday afternoons. They paired it with the first sequel ""Return of the Ginat Majin"".Now I haven't seen it since then...but it never left me. Aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy. Technically it isn't horror...until the statue comes to life at the end. It's just about a village ruled over by an evil man. There's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them...to no avail."|1
My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening, thinking that it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. On this promise, at least, the movie delivers: her character is ineffectual, adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche. As does the movie. A cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something I hope to quickly forget, so I won't make one. Basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on the red herrings: everybody appears guilty, rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning.|1
"I too saw this film at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and original. In a sea of terrible features, shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting, A.W.O.L however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to ""The Outer Limits."" The performances are solid, not that one would expect otherwise from Morse or McGinley, and the directing is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film I saw."|1
No pun intended . I 'm not going to spoil anything about the story , but it 's safe to say . . . . A few days ago I wrote to him in an email that I would be happy to review if the novel was going to be published . I have to say I am disappointed to be unable to review such a book , but for the moment I am really enjoying the story . I am glad the novel is in the works , and hopefully that 's going to be my last review on my site . . . . .|0
Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that, three decades later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect.The music is just extraordinary, packed with so much talent in writing, performance, arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by under-appreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them. While the film may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find truly grating and under-developed.|1
Eleven years ago , Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding out what happened to him and his family. It turned out to be a lie that was more than just another mistake. It was also a big lie that made it all the worse for all of his friends and his family as well. But the truth of that lie was always hidden from his people. That lie was a way for them and them to get together again. And that was what led him and the entire band of fans to have a reunion.|0
Wow . What can I say ? I was born in 1960 . I love bad TV movies . Love to read good movies and watch good movies . Love films . Love movies . Have read movies and read films .

"Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is , perhaps , not understandable for the `` rest of the film'' and that's not the case here, although the story is a little more complex, and I can't understand how the other two stories are connected. What do you think about the movie? Or are you not reading it right? I love it when people think about them and don't make any of their actual sense. Thanks,
John. I think I see the problem as a result of a misunderstanding."|0
Having watched this movie several times, I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for Goya, when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous,passionate life while the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era raged across Europe, surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw. While I do understand that Mr. Forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, I was left feeling that there was just so much of Goya left out, so much of his humanity.|1
"Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name ""employee of the month"" might ring bells with ""Office Space,"" and the show ""Office Clerk."" I think not. This isn't even a dark comedy. The director of this movie, whoever the guy's name, was a complete jerk, and has a sick, perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his top-notch job, and lies through his teeth 24/7."|1
This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957 . In fact , despite Ed Wood , Jr.and his dreadful cast and many of their worst films, it isn't so bad . We get to see a very good cast , and I'm really liking the cast , but they are by no means great . The first two movies (1955) and the first two movies (1957), were filmed at a hotel in Hollywood. I had to go there to get a ticket, but there is nothing else. I can't say that I fully enjoyed the first two scenes.|0
This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics , and is a must see for all psychotronic fans . It is definitely a must see for some people and even for those that want to spend a couple more hours with it . There is a very large community of cult fans, but you are welcome to visit it and learn more as well . The cult fans can also find a few really good guides on how to get started , and they are pretty good , too ! I have to say that I would not have picked up this classic if I wasn’t looking for one of them .|0
"Like all of the very earliest films, this ""movie"" is very, very short--lasting about one minute! So, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted--making Annabelle appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions--one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout."|1
"Although i do n't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago , I still remember it was an episode of cricket and how much it changed everything in cricket for the better

Hi, just a quick comment to make the point of this site. In this week’s post we will cover ‘Cricket’, and I want you to take the time to realize how amazing it is to be a cricket fan! I’m sure I can get you to the top of your mind as to why that is the case!"|0
Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country , which is always the Northern part . If black people were shown this film as a joke, it would be better to use the real thing, instead , since the real thing is impossible to hide , even with black people shown in that movie . ( , . . . .) If you can understand this story better, you could understand how this is not a joke , though it is a real joke . If I can learn from this , it will be the better to make it a real thing.|0
I've seen various Hamlets, and I've taught the play. As I watch Jacobi, I'm tempted to think that he's every bit as intelligent as Hamlet himself, so alive is he to every nuance of this character's wit. He deepens, rather than solves, every puzzle regarding Hamlet's character. He illuminates line after line, word after word, shining light into this sparkling mind. At the same time, however, we cringe at the horror Hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because Jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else.|1
Citizen Kane....The Godfather Part II....D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. This is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that transcends Academy Awards stars as Dolemite, the baddest cat in the universe. He clearly does not take any jive from no turkey (I myself am unfortunately a turkey) and proves it with his powers of rapping, pimping, and karate chopping. This is blaxploitation at its absolute finest, a shining example of the genre with its low budget, continuity errors, and hatred for rat-soup eating honkey expletive expletive.|1
I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are quite as bad as When Women Had Tails. It's a stinker of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like high art.|1
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen . The visuals were so dang choppy it made me feel sick. I had to leave the building to go to my parents' house. That was what it was like. When we got home after the movie concluded, we told the neighbors that the screen was full and we needed to take a cab to get home. I had to wait a couple of hours on the way home. When we arrived, I asked the police to get the truck out of our way, but they said we would be home in about 20 minutes.|0

To which he is told he is the greatest of Irishmen , for he has been in Australia for five years .

The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales . On The Buses is the second installment of the On The Buses trilogy . In this film the main story involves a British family travelling across the country to their first home country, and finding out that they have never met anyone in their life before. And this time they’ve arrived in Australia. They are from the Australian Capital Territory but they live in Australia and are keen to take their family to a new country.|0
I absolutely hated this movie . Even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message , it did not. But I really love the way the characters reacted to the film, especially the first part. I loved that it had all of the characters that were coming to life in the first two films, especially the girls. I can't wait for the next sequel . But I am sure that the time of the movie will not be very long enough. It's a terrible movie. I wish more would have gotten the rights to it.|0
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. I am not saying the script was bad in any way, I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was the script writer's fault.|1
I logged on here right after watching this movie , feeling that it was so awful that at least its not going to have a movie about it anymore . If I were to watch a movie about this film , the story would be completely lost . But the movies were so bad . So when I saw the movie again , I decided that these are the movies I'm going to watch for . I'm not really sure how to do it , so I'll just watch them anyway and not worry about it . But when I watched this movie, I'm pretty upset .|0
This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film Total Reality, don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film. This is, without peer, the single worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. I had nightmares of this movie ever since I saw it. The acting was terrible, and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film. The film blatently rips off far superior sci-fi films, such as TimeCop or Total Recall (where the title seems to have been derived from).|1
Ah ! When good actors take on bland material ! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight, funny movie then you can probably say it is, but only because there are some of the better people that are able to play it. They make it look bad when it is played and they want to add some of their favorite characters to it. If I were you I wouldn't be too worried, right ? You are so right. You know what I like to do when we are playing an amazing film ? I am sure you have enjoyed it a little bit too.|0
Like some other people wrote, I'm a die-hard mario fan, and I loved this game. This game starts slightly boring, but trust me, it's worth it. As soon as you start, your hooked! The levels are fun and exiting. They will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated, and is beautifully done. To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut about details. But please try this game! It'll be worth it!Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's that good!)|1
"`` The Love Letter '' is a somewhat pleasant , very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of the love letter is a great part, but there are a few jokes that are funny in it. It is a sort of ""I'm going to bed, I'll have a heart attack soon"", but it does seem funny. It was very popular in the early years, even though it was a joke in the early years, but I am still glad that it is still a funny comedy and it is very funny to hear."|0
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen . However , it is also one of the worst to watch on TV. It was never shown in theaters and even if I thought the movie was not horrible , I would have thought it would have ruined the film if it was. I have seen a few films that are worse but not as bad . My favorite would have to be this movie in my opinion. Here is a list of the worst movies that I have seen since my time in the studio. Here is a list of my favorite films.|0
Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction.|1
I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore. I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted for this. This is not an artistic movie, it is Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading. If you are a bible thumping Christian or a Mormon, watch this movie, you'll love it and think it is truly amazing. For anyone else, don't bother, the story is so contrived, random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way.|1
"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them."|1
No spoiler needed to steer you clear of this...well, bizarre film. Canada becomes part of the USA. OK. So, I guess I'm unusual, but I expected something about the implications of Canada becoming part of the USA. Silly me. Continue with this movie and you are off to cloud coocoo land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the film in which you will (trust me) not care a squat for any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South have to be among the most imaginative series ever.|1

i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14.i was really annoyed with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so i saw a film on the Disney channel and put it on and told her to watch it.she is 6 and she loved the film, some bits she didn't get like the ending but i didn't get that either y was Eddie the star of the video shoot i thought it was Jordan's video?! but she did enjoy it. i noticed the mistakes such as at the end Jordan was not actually playing the guitar, but she never.|1
"This is indeed one of the weakest films based on Agatha Christie's work, a lifeless, muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) of its predecessors (""Death On The Nile"", ""Evil Under The Sun"") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov as far as screen detectives go (of course, he is playing a character much less interesting than Poirot). The film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of Christie's plot alone (all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat."|1
I have recently found this film on one of my husband 's VHS tapes ( the blank variety which he had given as a gift ) which I thought would be very good, but it was not. In fact I don't remember anything about this film. It was based on the movie 'Viking' and I think it is just as bad. And I do think that one of the reasons for this is that the actors and actresses are all there at the same time . This was the first time I had heard of the film and I'm not sure about the final score of it .|0
Charles Bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen. But this movie lacks everything that a thriller/action-movie should have. There are a few action scenes in the movie, but they're really crappy. And when the action scenes fail, does the story save the film? Not at all, is my answer to that. The story is even worse than the action scenes. It's very straightforward and boring, and even though I'm a big movie fan, I almost fell asleep several times. I don't know how they came up with a failure like this.|1
The characterization in this movie is among the worst I 've ever encountered . The dialogue is trite and cliché, but the dialogue was a lot of fun to do and I was amazed at how the movie ended so well. I think it's safe to say that this was an interesting and enjoyable movie and is a good addition to the series (especially considering that you didn't have to play the dialogue). It's a shame that I never saw it before but I was pretty excited to see this movie.|0
During filming , was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon ? It was like she was reading from an autocue . I was reading from an autocue ? She was right . It was her . So, that was how it happened . We filmed the end of the show. It was the end of the show . It was the end of the show . And I think it was really amazing to see the audience come to see it . They had a great time . They said 'This is a show we are going to do, so this is something you just can't miss' .|0
After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, CBS television permitted Barbra to create an even more elaborate follow-up as her second special. Streisand wisely knew, in order to follow in the ground-breaking success of MY NAME IS BARBRA, that her second special would indeed need to raise the bar even further in inventiveness and spectacle. Not surprisingly, she succeeded once again. Even more impressively, Streisand managed to mount this large production without sacrificing the intimacy and vision of MY NAME IS BARBRA.Once again, the special is divided into three distinct Acts.|1
Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is , if you 're immediately expecting it to be a horror film. A horror film, with a good ending, should end on a different note than an anime. You might find it a little more interesting, since it is more about the experience of going to a place where it is more than a film or a television show. You 'll have more to think about here, and maybe it 'll be a better place for the viewer to go to when the anime starts to show.|0
""" While sporadically engrossing (including a few effectively tender moments) and humorous, the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'Homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling. With material like this, timing is everything (Michael Moore knew to release ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of Dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago, when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further. In 2006, mockery of the well-settled Bush Administration hardly seems as controversially compelling (or imperiled) as it did then."|1
Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress..... But this movie was so horrible, I couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that I was actually watching something so crappy. Ha ha. The audio editing is horrible, They try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. Because they're just weird and stupid. The script sucked. Acting was horrible, storyline not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it is a 20 year old movie..... so I'll give it a bonus point for that. And yeah, the music was terrible.|1
This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths . Well written by Shane Black , the film is executed flawlessly , yet there is still something strange and fascinating about the characters that makes the story exciting . It takes us through the final days of the United States of America and the events that occurred before the war that we were told about . The final act is as follows: In the early 1970s, a young man named Sam Smith, who was the only non-commissioned major in the army, was on his way to war.|0
i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness), i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished, yet alone turn out so great.the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the film's greatest asset.|1
The greatest tragedy man faces is that, capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this fact does so much great tragedy emerge. Death in Venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head-on.It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms-self denial and decay. Undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. Its austerely refined look, echoey sound, mixture of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy: as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director.|1
Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor 's planning to hijack a casino , ala `` Ocean 's 11-star hotels. I got to see what they had planned for a few weeks ago. They had a couple of rooms they were hoping to build in New Jersey, with a small casino in New Jersey. So, after watching the first couple nights and seeing how fast people were planning to make those kinds of plans, I wanted to make sure I was ready to go back to New Jersey. They were doing that, I told myself.|0
I have n't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western . Or how one commentator could think it's okay if you don't read all the relevant books and the book that they've been read in and they still think you have something to prove that it's okay that way. I would take this comment very seriously, but you have no doubt that I've read all the relevant books. This is the first time in as much as I've ever read a non-literature book. In this way, it would give you two options.|0
I do n't know where to begin . Perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen . . . if you think it's the only one of my films, you'd think we didn't have much money . . . maybe we just weren't in the market for anything else. I have no idea where I would begin . Maybe it was just a disaster waiting to happen . . . maybe people were getting it wrong! I had to stop. It was too early. Maybe I was trying to help a couple of people.|0
Inappropriate . The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA . Whale Rider is not the only bad one as there are many good characters in the movie . The movie is also in some areas that the MPAA was able to help out with, but it didn't make it the top pick for them . The film is about a teenage girl trying to figure out whether it's time to go home and have her get her driver's license . The movie was supposed to include some of the major elements of the movie but that was changed to the most important elements of the film .|0
`` Ghost Son '' is Lamberto Bava 's best film and , at the same time , also his worst film of the year . It was released on May 11th, 2006 by Sony Pictures Classics in North America. It was his best film release , but it wasn’t his best film , it was his worst . It didn’t even finish on the release date until December 19, 2007. It also wasn’t his best film until July 1st, 2009, when it was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.|0
Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times.|1
Very odd , this seems like a very average movie to me , if not slightly less . It is the kind of movie I'd like for a movie in which there's always a lot of space between the main plot and the story. There was a lot to like, and the only thing that didn't fit in that box was the way the script was put together. A lot of stuff in that script didn't fit in and didn't work out for the film. But this was something I've really wanted to do in my own movie, for the time being .|0

WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! 'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.|1
I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! Awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!Awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! Awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! Awfully acted - I found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth!|1
I was sorely disappointed in this movie. Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing. The movie has elements that allude to all the seamy things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing.And Richard Dutcher does a great disservice to the LDS Church in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical.My biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie.Dutcher's God's Army One was okay.|1
If (as I just pointed out in THE GOAT) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding themselves at odds with the law, this Langdon short (the last released before he did TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic ploy - being married to a shrewish spouse, and trying to get away for some secret two-timing dating. Laurel & Hardy did this in several films, as did Fields, and Chaplin. I have a problem with it - why do these characters always marry such nasty women?|1
I saw this movie last night on HBO & didn't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened & you will too. It's a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida and subsequent investigation, arrest, & trial of a 15 year old boy.Watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society. This film was most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - you'll be moved to tears.|1
I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti , do not see this movie . If you do , do you have seen this . If you do . You have to go to the link . If you have already seen the American Graffiti , then go to this link . If you don't know why and what to do . I don't . But I would say that this was a very bad movie . There are a lot of pictures of American Graffiti and that was the reason why I would not include it . I would recommend it to you .|0
This is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party I go to . It's really the most fun thing I've ever done but it's the best one I have ever seen. I don't mean to make you feel bad but you have to know it. You are the only person in the world who would have done it if they'd been allowed to. This is the world you are in. I mean, you have your own personal beliefs on this. How do I tell my friends that I would do it if they would let me.|0
"Oh yeah, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of ""worst 80's slasher ever made"". ""The Prey"" has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine, derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before (and better), insufferable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of gore and suspense, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!)."|1
The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family : the twenty years old Emily Brighton (left) was shot to death by police after she was shot at a house party. The family says she was killed by a white man. Emily Brighton’s parents are said to be very upset, and so are the officers who responded to the shooting. They are accused of being responsible for the death of their daughter. A photo posted on Instagram says a police officer is in the room with her mother who’s in the process of shooting her.|0
I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone. He's one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to come out! This sends God and the whole human being factory into a crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try and convince the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born.|1
"The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film, ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still ""bothered""."|1
"The movie opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli. It appears he doesn't have enough cash to cover the check. Instead of reaching for his plastic, he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, ""Lulu"" (Melanie Griffith) had been observing him from the other side of the deli. ""Lulu"" is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980's with a brunette page-boy cut."|1
Some movies you 'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.Some you 'll watch because they touch your heart, your sense of place, your soul, the world around you, your spirit, your mind and your mind's own sense of self and self.Sometimes you 'll watch because they touch your soul, your body, your soul, your heart, your soul, your mind, your world, your spirit, your mind's own self and, your mind's mind.You know what I mean?|0
I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class. This film is what is wrong with America today, instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault. This film goes through the downfall of Flint, Michigan and blames it 100% on General Motors. In the process of doing so Moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of General Motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society.|1
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week. Never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you IMDB). About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star Hugh Grant or forty something's. The story is a morality tale but never preachy, throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the colour grading, especially in the night club sequences.|1
I tried . I really , really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a 5 star. I would probably have done something else in this regard but I would not do it, it would simply not be in this case. Thank you for this post, this is a good one, I'd like to think it would do the best for me! I don't know if I've ever made a movie like that, I'm just a bit stuck on the concept for now, but it seemed like something I could do that would do just that.|0
I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since I work in the wine business, I had been quite eager to see this documentary, and I wasn't disappointed. Reportedly drawn from over 500 hours of footage, the good news is that Nossiter will be releasing not only a theatrical cut, but a ten-part, ten hour series of the film on DVD by next Christmas (ThinkFilm is distributing it). The bad news is that it's still a bit of an unwieldy beast. When it was shown in Cannes, it was close to three hours long.|1
Most movies I can sit through easily , even if I do not particularly like the movie . I am usually more than happy with the movie when I can enjoy it . It is nice to know that the movie will come to you in your dreams . That is a big thing when you have a dream and you like it . . . You must think that the movie is really easy to enjoy and that you will enjoy the movie . I hope you will like it . But before you make the comment , make sure to read the full article. It is not my blog .|0
If you decide to watch Wild Rebels , do n't expect anything deep and meaningful . If you 're looking for a strong game, you'll definitely have to give it a shot. If you are looking for a hard to see game, you'll probably have to look a little harder at what you're looking for. A few things to take into consideration should be the first thing that happens. It can be difficult to take a shot at the game of the week. The game of the week will probably be one of the most interesting games to watch , so keep an eye out for it!|0
What crack are you smoking ? This movie , while gloriously entertaining , is awful ! The action scenes are so detailed , I could not find any details on them , so that you can enjoy them with your friends , but you would not find any other movies which are of such great quality as it. So that I would highly recommend it . !!!! I would highly recommend this movie , if you will . Thanks for watching . It will make your life more enjoyable . !!!! Thank you , I will watch the next one .|0
There is a difference between a `` film , '' and a `` movie . '' A film , regardless of how many pictures are in the picture, is the difference between a `` film , '' and a `` movie . '' The difference between the difference between film and movie depends on what the movie looks like, and what the movie looks like. The difference is not necessarily a matter of style, or even whether the difference between film and movie looks the same. To understand the differences between two movies, we will start with the definition of `` film ,'' that will be used in this book.|0
Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.At first, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India.|1
I am utterly astonished at how over-rated `` Cemetery Man '' is among horror fans ! Now , I usually go out and look at that picture, but it is so awful. It is so bad it is like a TV show or a horror film. I have no idea what to do, but I like to know what is in the middle of the story. But that is only because I do not like it. I know a lot of people who don't care about the show, but I would like to say that it has made the show more popular, and that is why I am here.|0
"Sometimes it 's hard to be a pirate ............... but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun doing it.....
And I'm really glad to see her on this show, I've never seen anything like her. She was an amazing woman and I really wish I had her back. I really wish I could see her again in person. I've always had my doubts about her but I can't wait to see what she'll do. She will always be one to keep an eye out for............ I'm glad you liked what you heard."|0
"With its rerelease by ADV Films, I've had a chance to watch ""The Giant Majin"" for the first time without the deep cuts and unkind words of a late night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? It's a pretty damn good movie!The sets are authentic, the acting in subdued and believable, and the giant Majin is stately, powerful, and unstopable. I loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, luck charm, etc), and the potrayal of the god as a little less than 'good'.This movie is begging for a remake in the new century!"|1
"I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great . I rated it 8 out of 10 . I am looking to buy it again. It seems to be great! Great price. I have watched this many times on Netflix and i have never had this in my life! My wife and I were wondering if this is what Netflix is for. If you have any questions please contact me . I will try to help you get everything I have been looking for. I have never had a time like this. Thanks

A couple of years ago when Netflix made a movie that made you laugh."|0
Excerpt from TV GUIDE : This week on THE LOVE BOAT , Captain Stubing has his hands full when a big news story that is on the way comes out this week. The story of a man who, upon hearing the news about him, gets killed. This week, Captain Stubing was attacked with a knife in the face of a mob. He was hit with a gun and then shot. And here's the story. In a small town in Wisconsin, in the 1980s, this was an incident. There were about three hundred people who were killed, and all the people were in their early 20s.|0
"This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80 's entertainment . Oh do n't get me started. If only it weren't for the way it looks today , you'd have to go back to the 1980s and 1980s and try to make up for it with a few more good old fashioned movies. If it were a 90's flick it's going to be so much better

What you are saying is, this guy has made movies for 20 years and he doesn't even like those. And you know what I'm saying here?"|0
I loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and I had forgotten this film existed until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station. I bought it and I couldn't wait to watch this film that had I loved as a kid, and then as I saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... Why in the world did I like this film as a Kid, watching it again as an adult I realized that this film is terrible.|1
"I'm not a big musical fan, but this is one of the few I really love. Unlike many other musicals, such as ""The Sound of Music,"" none of the songs are about gratuitous stuff. Each song is social commentary, acumen on war, sexuality, recalcitrance, spirituality, and freedom. Especially amazing songs are ""Easy To Be Hard,"" ""Age of Aquarius,"" ""Hair,"" ""Flesh Failures/3-5-0-0,"" ""Walking In Space,"" and ""Hare Krishna."" Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to someday see it live!"|1
This is marvelous movie, about a soul of Ale. This is a journey to Ale's heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes talk. Especially on the silent scenes. The window of Ale is a great one. An the scenes when he lies in bed are one of the best directed scenes I have seen. Apart from directing. It has been a quite time I did not watch a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say that, this film proves that the age does not matter about your soul.|1
Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece. They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work.|1
I 'm racking my brain , but I ca n't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley Of the Kings. In fact it's one of my alltime favorite films. I know you're thinking I'm mad at myself, and I think I should probably call myself a movie star, but a movie about two kids living on the same island, playing for a living, I would be more interested in the way this plays out. The Valley of Kings is a wonderful movie that I really enjoy.|0
I do n't leave IMDb comments about films but this .... this film was bad . very bad . I can't watch this film . i have seen it . I can play it . . but i can't watch this movie . i don't know if i can even play it . but i'm afraid if i cannot watch this movie . . i don't even think imdb , so im thinking imdb is bad , it will be like this in every movie i've ever had . it's because i can't do it .|0
Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi; it's a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, on and on, they persist.Some one at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good one) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi.A few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty, making productions that were not just for us mere, lame-o Trekkies. Thanks so much, Sci-Fi!|1
Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen, it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever, it was all awful jokes.The acting sucks, many of the characters sucked at acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor, the other characters suck too (Magaret, Rain, Hal).The plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable.|1
This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it 's one of the few examples of the kind of cinematography where you could have a great camera in the beginning, you'd never really want to go there in the middle. I think there's still some room for improvement, particularly at the end. I'd love to try it and see how much I can get right now. But before I say anything more, I just want to make sure I'll be there as soon as I get to it.|0
"They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to be remembered."" ""And, in fact, most people don't bother to learn the difference between what we are seeing and what we are experiencing."" ""It's better to forget than to remember."" ""It's also easier in reality to remember."" ""Why is that?"" ""I think it's because our minds are a lot like those of animals."" ""You may think it's so much better to forget about."""|0
Two years after this movie was made , `` The Juror '' came out . Do n't waste your time. It's a good movie (and if there's a lot of it, you can get your hands on some pretty cool ones). The title of the movie is pretty simple : ''The Juror'' is a real character, and a true story. He has to fight for life. He's an evil man, and you should get a chance to look into his past as he tries to get his life back in order.|0
"I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel got only one more season. But when the end came closer I was exited to see that. And what did we get? This episode called ""NOT FADE AWAY"" was the very last one.I was so disappointed by this episode. This is absolutely the worst way to this series. Why couldn't it get a happy ending? Why did have a few of the main characters to die? Why did Angel not become a human and was reunited with Buffy again? No."|1
This is a little-seen anti-war film that has been ignored for too long . The time is Thanksgiving of 1972. In this short film it is revealed that it was the beginning of the end for the United States. The end was just a couple of years after World War I. It is no coincidence that this is where it takes place. The United States is at the very heart of the world today. It would have to have gone through a whole period that was quite different had the United States not been involved in war.|0
I ca n't believe some of the comments here in the reviews . The film is dated of course , and there is no clear evidence as to where it came from but there are enough similarities that I believe it should have been seen in the original movie . But as the film has many similarities that are not the same. So it should not have been seen in the original movie . The same is true in many other films . The film as such has a lot more similarities than many others in that there is a good portion of the cast as well as a great actor .|0
"Like Margot in ""Fear of Fear"" falls victim of her ambitious husband, like Fox in ""Fox and his friends"" is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away, like Xaverl Bolwieser in ""The Stationsmaster's Wife"" who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him, like Hermann Hermann who seeks refuge in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and bankrupt company, so also Hans Epp is a victim of the German ""Wirtschaftswunder""-Society after World War II in R.W."|1
I just got back from `` AGS '' . After seeing it , I 'm convinced that no matter how much money I've spent on it, it's not enough for me as a programmer, so I'll pay it back, if I'm ever able to spend it. But after some time I have to try to do the right things. So, here is what I have done, to make it worth while, and to give it a try to the next version of AGS I'm working on.|0
With a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, Goya. Then after half an hour you decide it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. With lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, Milos Forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it.|1
"I 'm a fan of the horror movie , regardless of which hemisphere it comes from . I know what you're thinking :P.

So, let's go back to the source of your question:
If you've ever read the comic book that is supposed to be the horror movie, this is your source. You'll see how it starts, and what you're getting at. If you've ever read it, the source, you'll see a bit of what's in the book:

This page

It has a couple of pages about the story behind this."|0
This film makes several nods to various science fiction films . The prologue reminds me of the one for the novel . . . it’s an alliterative story in which the characters grow up and eventually mature . . . it’s more than an introduction, more than a prologue . . . it’s the best way to think about the films you see, so don’t forget it . . . a great read . . . this film is a great introduction to the films and how they got into the industry . . .|0
First of all , I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Campbell and have tried to put it off. The film is a great addition to any anime series and would be very much appreciated in future anime series because the characters are so good. I think the character design is just so much fun and has been done before, but I cannot remember the best anime characters to use. The character design looks great. It's not the only character in the anime.|0
This gem captures early 80 's life brilliantly . As a grad '83 boymyself , I must say that Valley has been my home for over forty years ! I'm sure it's the best place to start looking for work - just in time for Valentine Day! It's definitely not the time to go out of your way to find a workbook for your friends. When I went to work for you I was amazed. I have been working on many projects for some time , but I think that's the last time I will ever be in an office .|0
This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made . It is a story told in a steady fashion , and it’s very funny and relatable . I know that I’ve said it before and I’m certain that it is, but if it’s the only thing in it’s life for me, then it’s going to be a masterpiece . What do you think? Will it please your parents? Will it please your sisters? If it is the film, what’s it going to look like?|0
Like a lot of the comments above me , also I though this was the average scifi movie , but it wasn’t . I mean . . . How does one explain that the movie’s plot was also in the script, or that the movie was also based on the film? And how did the story develop? I don’t know, but maybe you could give me a hint. I don’t care, the story is really interesting, but if I had a clue, please let me know. I also have a couple of references on the movie.|0
A scientist ( George Zucco ) wants to create wolf men out of American soldiers to fight the Nazis , and in the meantime the United States Army has a secret secret weapon to keep in their secret underground bunker of the American Embassy. Zucco believes that the secret weapon has been used since at least 1945. That's not the only claim that the CIA has made from the documents. And this isn't just because the CIA hasn't given any official explanation of its use. What's more, the documents show that the CIA is also making the same claim that the Pentagon is doing so.|0
I thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking , but was I wrong ? I feel like there's so much more than this here. I've been searching and researching for this for many years and all of the info that you give is all wrong for sure. The reason for this isn't really for the sake of understanding it, it's just the way the film has gone. This film would have been better if it had an interesting story, but this has yet to make it onto my shelves.|0
"I really tried to like ""Saw."" The story was good, and I admire the breakneck pace of the way the film was shot. However, there were too many clichés and elements that while they may have looked ""cool,"" they really made no sense.First, what I liked about the film was the overall tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good in a thankless role as a doctor's abducted wife."|1
The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only `` star power '' if we can call it a star is in the same place and in the same position. I've seen it and it seems to have no problems, but it isn't really that simple to get close to the main character's face from an anime movie. His face has been shot with a shotgun, but it was a little too close. I don't care if it's the same angle it used in a TV anime, but I'm looking at the anime from that angle.|0
William Petersen ( that C.S.I guy ) has a small uncredited role but it 's the best part of the movie for me. It was great to watch it again, and he had a lot of laughs. A huge deal. It was a good movie but I would still recommend it because he really had great chemistry with his characters. He was very fun to watch, and a great guy to have with his friends when he was around. I highly recommend it to friends and family of any age. He could be a real fun movie to watch.|0
"`` THE KING OF QUEENS , '' in my opinion , is a pure CBS hit ! Despite the fact that it was only released on July 1st , it was still a hit ! But with all these changes , it had a very positive and important impact on everything ! And now we have a big hit ! Thank you : ) ""And now . . . "" "" . . . "" "" ."" . . . ."" "" The KING OF QUEENS ( "" ) is one of the biggest hit titles of the film , and it was not the only one! """|0
Valley Girl will always hold a special place in my heart : I would say this is certainly the best part of the year : I know it's the last year for it, but I'm still happy to be living it :). In fact, I'm going to give you an excerpt from that great piece, with a little bit more depth on the story. It is a story of a young woman who gets into trouble for the crime of being in love. And it's the first thing you see when you are walking out of your apartment.|0
My first post at the IMDb has to (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good lighting. It doesn't make any sense. If you enjoy bad acting, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras posed at bad angles, and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness, you'll love this movie. I could shut the lights off in my house and scream too, and I wouldn't have to pay for the rental.|1
This film wasn't good at all. I was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content I was forced to watch. It's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's Union's brother. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister. This had to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever.|1
Being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura story) but this one isn't the worst I've ever seen. Yes its bad but its better than some of the others I've mentioned.Hulk Hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network. Let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture USA Network having Rip...and TNT will go to any lengths to get him.Does this make sense...no?|1
While out divining for water , a young psychic woman named Jessica Burns ( Carolyn Kearney ) stumbles upon something which may or may not be magical, but which she cannot possibly be the reason that she fails to see for herself, her life, or her own destiny. In this, the woman’s powers are not yet manifest, since she does not have any magic, but only a spirit, which she never knew existed before she began. “How to understand magic?” I ask, trying to make out the answer.|0
`` Hardbodies 2 '' is harmless , aimless and plot less . I would add `` brainless '' to that sentence. Then again, if you're feeling a bit paranoid, we could probably make you use that word in a joke. So it doesn't work as you'd expect . You would have to think about a few of the differences, as we did with the first two, to come to a conclusion: a lot of things happen when your mind wanders. To put that sentence in the same place as the second sentence is a bit odd.|0
"One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar . Great comedies and comedy shows are available to suit audiences, and it would be great to see them on Indian networks and TV shows for free . Best comedy series of 2012

There are various types of comedy series of 2012, and some of the types of series are good to watch, and they might be recommended. Here we will list the good ones to watch, and then give some recommendations for choosing the best series of 2012."|0
If you enjoy riddles and suspense , you will enjoy this movie . Truth be told it was mostly the best movie ever made in my lifetime . However, I did like how it was told from the start , it is not like this movie . I will never be able to tell you why, but you will if you like it . . . The movie is a little bit sad because it was filmed in the UK, but it was released in the USA . The movie I liked was a really good movie , it was also funny .|0
When HULK hit theaters in 2003, it wasn't long before DVDs of the old Incredible Hulk TV show popped up in an attempt to cash in on the craze. We saw a similar occurrence a year prior when Spider-Man cartoons appeared on DVD to coincide with that hero's big screen debut. Companies leap at the opportunity to ride on the financial coattails of a hot brand.So the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of Wal-Mart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot. I guess everyone involved would just rather forget.|1
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie , like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the Jackals' movies that had been filmed. They were set at the end of the 80s with the arrival of the Japanese military, and there was a lot to watch. As I've mentioned, I was watching the film with a lot of horror. I didn't want to be the first person to do it. And I wasn't. But I've watched it many times, I can't remember the reason for it or how it ended up on the shelves.|0
There 's a good story well hidden and never really used ! The film is short and overly dependent on what it was meant to do, and I have to say I have never seen it. The film is interesting to watch as well, because I was always interested in the characterisation of the writer. The characterisation was a challenge, but it got me thinking. I don't even know if the film made the right impression on the reader. It just made up some characterisation in the right way, rather than doing anything to make the story any more interesting.|0
By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching it's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a scientist in the future, whom while prisoner regales his captor of the story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) had first built the evil Lament Configuration puzzle-box that sets evil upon the world and how his bloodline had subsequent dealing with said box. The film is a awash with lack of continuity in regards to the other films and lack of coherency in this one.|1
With a title like that , you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter , but it's not. The writer who makes his work in such a way that we all get the same sense that we see a painting done on a piece of canvas, and the artist in the painting will take all of his inspiration from his subject , as well as the painting's subject and use the image to create new and interesting images. It's not an art movie; it's not a film. In fact, in the film, a painting is a work of art or a novel.|0
"Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who's the working definition of the word ""dreamer"" and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. Adele, wanting to make a fresh start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California.Decent, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. Best thing it offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.Could be better, could be worse.I gave this one seven out of ten."|1
Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. Its hard to believe the famous Chopra's have produced this lousy movie. It was presented as a movie for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sex comedy. Nor does it make you laugh, but cry of boredom and nor does it have any sexy girls to make the film look sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors ever with no acting talent.|1
I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual `` horror '' movie again . I had been disappointed with what happened because it was too bad for a '' movie. I wanted the story to end up as good as the main one, even if it would turn out to be a horror movie itself, so I didn't mind that there would be an end to it. I was also pleased with the story as it was a lot more entertaining than the main film. When the movie is shown on TV, it's really a movie.|0
Right up ( or down ) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool in the first half of the game, in terms of the main characters and their actions, but you wouldn’t get much more than the second half with this level. The same goes for the visuals and story. And in terms of gameplay, I don’t think this game is going to be played in a way that makes the gameplay stand up more or less like a movie, and I think that is a good thing, especially from an aesthetic point of view.|0
This movie was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but don't be mislead, it's not at all. There are barely any weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weed in this movie. The marijuana field is merely a plot device.My impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of (their idea of) witty dialog and make a movie. The product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting, to say this movie has no 'hook' is a huge understatement.|1
I 've never understood this type of spoof movies . You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and doesn't want to watch . This spoof, though, does not seem to be as effective as it once was , but we do know that the only people that ever saw the spoof in reality are the actors themselves . We also know that many movies that are spoofs are based on the false premise that the movie is real . It is only fair to ask if anyone who actually sees the movie can tell us anything about the fake .|0
When the film started I got the feeling this was going to be something special . The acting and camera work really caught my attention because of how the characters were handled and what the camera looked like. Not only did I think the camera worked very well, but I also got the impression this was a big movie and a great experience for my fans. Now I am so glad I am a fan of the film and will continue to be with the movie . I had been thinking about this a couple times before, but I was very disappointed with the way that the casting of the film was going.|0
"A satire about greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to make fun of. Jim Carrey's reign was certainly short lived. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrayal is nothing short of creepy. He produced this, this ""masterpiece"" as well, so he can't blame anyone here. ""The number one comedy in America"" shout the desperate TV adds. Of course, Jim Carrey was suppose to guarantee full houses but the game is over."|1
....OK, small-town, clueless sheriff? Check. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Ne'er-do-well boyfriend of sheriff's hot daughter, whom sheriff hates? Check. Corporate land developer who greedily puts profit over people? Check. Developer's rank-and-file accidentally unleashing a primordial monster, then being pressured to cover it up? Check. Natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were? Check. Amateurish CGI special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check.|1
This is a very , very odd film ... one that is so odd it 's best you just see it from the beginning, because it's the beginning of a process which leads to the outcome that is being sought out in the film ... in this film, they are the beginning and it is being sought out, and they know they're not going to be in the film until they get a chance to get in, so this is like the first time you look at it, and you get in and they know you're not coming in until you see the film.|0
"Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports ""it takes a village to raise a child"" and reminds of an important time in black history and culture. I gained an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress."|1
OK, this movie wasn't good at all. Video games aren't what I would brag on if I was over the age of 15. Cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. Just play a video game, don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I don't loose my girlfriend in that. Grease being the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical.|1
There 's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me . You can see the entire film in this video. I will be very careful not to get in the same fix for this because I am not giving it away in the name of X-Files so it's very important. So let's get the film up to speed. This was shot in two sets. The first set used a lot of 3-D lighting but that was fine. The second set used only light. I didn't have to worry about the quality of this film as the camera was very accurate.|0
This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun , friendship , and entertainment , and for the enjoyment of those who do not know what they’ve been missing out on the most. In the original film, a young woman, in her thirties, gets caught in the middle, and ends up spending her childhood with her boyfriend. She is, at best, a spoiled little girl, who finds herself attracted to many of her friends and family who are in her family’s “lovely neighborhood” – her mother, grandmother, uncle, and brother.|0
Eve is an eye opener, because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. This movie shows a good aspect on the human body being God's creation and to considerate about it, viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of Adam and Eve (either if it's true or just a fairy tale, depending on what we believe) from watching this movie. Actress/model Inger Ebeltoft's impersonation of Eve is so good, there's no good word to describe her performance, and I can't imagine having another actress being Eve.|1
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground.|1
Mickey Rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the IRA and goes on the run in London !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . Things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in Northern Ireland which gives A PRAYER FOR THE DYING a stark realism . However as soon as Fallon decides he's going to give up violence ( What ?|1
"With a name like ""10 Commandments"" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the Bible, specifically Exodus. Not so here. This is standard procedure with any Biblical Hallmark-made film. Remember ""Noah""?? That was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least this film had ""some"" truth to the original story. However, Menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of Moses, is not in the original story. Other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated."|1
"I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off. Every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the Oscar Wilde story by the inept screenplay writer. It barely matters because the dire acting, clichéd camera-work and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart who comes across as the most hammy, talentless, minor mock-Shakespearean nincompoop as the ghost. ""Get thee out of here!"" he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain."|1
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers a welcoming article each month that includes details about her awesome home life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication demands that she have him and a WW2 hero as guests during the Christmas Holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, isn't married, and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all!|1

What a self-indulgent mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic, badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco.In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall - from abused, working class lad to criminal English lord. However, the tone is either so self-pitying or so arch, that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot.|1
Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach . When I watch a movie I think, “this isn’t good”, but when I look at a movie I do think about, “I’m thinking of all the good movies and I am sick to my stomach, and I don’t know if this is really what I want”. And it’s so much fun to see my stomach turn into something that makes it feel good. So, here are a few things I think are worth looking through.|0
"Dude...I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak...but this is too much. The worst lead actress EVER!! Not even David ""Hot Pants"" Boreanaz is able to save this crap. No wonder I NEVER watch Fox  it blows!! We totally gave it a chance, and it continued to suck. We watched four or five painful, agonizing episodes. I want to kill the execs at the network SO BAD! Why is money being spent on this drivel?!?!"|1
"this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yasho’s third installment in a trilogy of films. If there were a third installment of this movie and if you like this trilogy, that is what you got. The Story

The Story begins with a young girl living in an apartment in New York. The story takes place in the early 80’s and ends when she falls in love with a college student who was born in Japan. This is the last scene of this film as there is only one shot that I can remember of it."|0
"What? - that was it? The town sheriff (John Agar) blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write that? Did I just see that? With instrumentals by The Wildcats, ""Night Fright"" is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967. The heyday of the gorilla was well over, and anyone other than Ray Corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble. Remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4.0 rating on the IMDb."|1
It's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. But immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. The fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. The all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from JP 1 and 2. The story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. This gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!|1
This movie was , of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen , by far the worst . I was really amazed that they made this movie so bad as to not be worthy of being a movie and I loved them as a kid . I was a little scared about the film but after a few minutes they said to me 'this is not going to be good . I have never been good at film production so I don't have a great deal of time to spend . I just think if this was good I would do better'.|0
As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch. Too unreal. It seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care. The card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game. Common sense right? Plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks. Who couldn't do that? The cheating was amateur stuff. Palming, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards?|1
"I rented this movie, after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of ""five stars!"" on that Attack of the Show show. Well when I turned around the DVD and it showed the 3 stages of hell, well I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit.I wasn't expecting ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie."|1
Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film, but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for. When in theory we should be watching for the narrative.The plot is thin on the ground, and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba is, she doesn't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible 'Dark Angel' series. Since Dark Angel it seems that Alba has been reduced to mere eye candy(but what eye candy!|1
"Historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences, etc. However, historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history. This film does not. The only scene I actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with, ""I don't remember sending for room service"". The main entertainment value is in its badness; I recommended my local video story put it on the ""Turkeys"" shelf."|1
After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon , I could n't quite figure out why so many people don't have the nerve to watch this show, so I decided to look at the characters and see how the character played. First , I would like to state I have a pretty poor memory of this movie, so I've only just gotten started. While watching this movie , I was curious to see how the characters played. Basically, they didn't play very well in the film. Basically, they could play a couple of different ways of playing the characters.|0
I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. The bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger-turned-human-sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made-for-TV-movie music informs us a killing is taking place, not a make-out session.|1

This gem captures early 80's life brilliantly. As a grad '83 boymyself, I must say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times atRidgemont High )stands out as the class of the teen sex filmgenre. The characters are accurate representatives of the era; thevapid mall chicks, pseudo punk rebels, preppy jocks are allrepresented here.I have seen this over ten times now. The music in the film was topnotch. Unfortunately, these tunes could were never as popular intheir era as those by arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx orLoverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I searched out recordsand tapes (it was the 80's after all !)|1
A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors delivered up to standard (Juliette Lewis cuddly as ever; William Hurt solid but in the background; Shelley Duvall convincing as ever) but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and, the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was nice to he girl, so guess what?! Then the final after-twist I do not know what to think of that.|1
When I was driving home after work, I bought some movies for my four year old twins. I had bought this movie my kids would enjoy. I watched this with my children. My 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up. In this movie ,the dad acts like a tard. My little ones would watch it every day.One day, they threw away all our movies.I SOLD THE Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Grade: F++++++++++++++++ I rather be seen on the worst dress list.My kids now hate this dumb movie. If gives the idea that germs can talk to each other.|1
First off, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit (the guys who get called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real-life experience.But still, there are some points one notices as totally unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouth/nose-pieces of the masks and that there is not enough smoke, because the public would otherwise see nothing. But some things defy logic: - No second mask attached to the oxygen.|1
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece . The first sequel , Jailhouse 41 , was not even released until 2011, but has since been released in several other locations. With this title, the first female demon in history, the first female heroine of the world, she will bring the mystery to an end, the first female heroine of the universe, and the first female protagonist in history. The character is the second female heroine in history who will face the consequences of her actions, and the second female protagonist in history, she will face the world.|0
I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines . One exception for this is the one in a series which is also a remake of _Nisha_ (1954). The film was released on July 11, 1956, and had an opening sequence that was not quite as memorable as it might have been, but was nevertheless enjoyable. It is the first of the many adaptations of Hindi movies of the same genre, with the original set being moved from the beginning of the movie into the final scenes. It was the first film released of this type.|0
I 'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon . I 've seen only 4 movies, but I'm glad that they're on again . I know that in some cases, you just have to watch all the old movies . And I think I know what I need to watch now . But no, I don't . I'm just learning that the movies that I'm looking forward to are a lot of the stuff that I don't . But I'm not looking for them . But now I know . . I've just found the new ones .|0
This movie was outright painful for me to watch . I understand that indie films do not have the same success. But they were the best I had seen, and I could not believe that I could find one more. So I chose it as the movie for me, because I wanted it to be a movie. It’s not like I would have been disappointed in the first movie. I knew what I wanted, but I’d already watched it before, in a few months. But it’s just like the movie.|0
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. I realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. Beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart rack...You know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget.|1
I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand . What I found was a badly scripted account. I was sitting there thinking, 'Can't the New Zealanders see this? Do I really have the right to see it?' After reading the essay I began to realize that I should have asked the New Zealanders a question I already asked them. As far as I understood, the answer to that question was, 'Why would you do something like that?' And then I began to ask myself the second question: 'Why am I doing this?'|0
This film is one of my fondest childhood memories . Seeing the Muppets ( at the height of their popularity ) is not something I should have been doing, I just wanted to see the Muppets. There were two girls in this group, and I’m sure that one of them is going to be in the next generation, and that is why I’m glad that this group of girls can grow up and become a couple. It seems to me that one of the most powerful things about this movie was that there were more girls in the movie, and there were more of them.|0
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it's follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. After just watching this film, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito. What is great about them, though, is that, even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are each vastly different from the others.|1
"This is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer . I don't remember seeing a scene where a boy from a movie was killed during a scene. I just saw a scene in which he was killed in the scene and I thought, ""Well, if they're going to shoot me, maybe I should just kill them first."" I don't know what I'd do with him. The boy is a boy from a movie, so, it's hard to think of any other boy in my house who's being killed."|0
This is a bad film , as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was created by a bad filmmaker , and the audience was so upset when they saw what was said. I’m not the biggest fan of the film , just not as it does a nice job of getting everyone thinking, “yeah I saw it but it was really good ,” but this movie is still very good . As you might have noticed, it is also very good, but it’s the worst film of the last ten years, and I hate the whole film.|0
Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli's entry in Mick Garris' Masters of Horror series. Coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the Phantasm series and the irresistibly weird Bubba Ho-Tep; but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this TV episode. The plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman. This time, it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. After a head on crash, she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac.|1
Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this.|1
Normally, I do not review online, but it's Saturday and I'm trapped in my room, on a rainy day with nothing to do but watch sci-fi movies and Xena: Warrior Princess (I can't get the damned 'Joxer the Mighty' song out of my head, it's been there for the past ten years or so, just pops up randomly when someone(me) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this movie, and actually post them on the internet, do you have ANY idea how much of an idiot you look like?|1
I 'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes , so I watched this show when it came out in 2009 and I knew I should watch it now and it was one of my favorite shows to watch. I loved it and so did Mariam . If you want to know more about the show you have to watch the full episodes here . If you are a fan of the show you can watch some of its episodes here . I loved all of them and I can't wait to see if they become my favorite shows again .|0
When one of my friends recommended this to me , raving about how well it was filmed , the underlying image I found was very pretty, and it really made me happy, and I would probably use the pictures to do more than I do with any other film. The way it looks and feels is a bit odd, as it seems to be built-in to the camera. I'm not sure what I'm doing, I used a set of photos and had them all on my phone to make it feel a bit more organic in the way I normally do.|0
"This is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. To borrow from the late Douglas Adams, ""Watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick. "".What is wrong? Everything. British actors posing as Americans, there have been many that can pull it off like Bob Hoskins but he isn't in this one."|1
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time , I was n't expecting a show with complex story lines to be there . . . But now I'm feeling the urge to do something else with the film, so I figured I would share the experience . . . This was my first time to see what I've been up to . . . It's about a couple of people . . . The man in the middle of it . . . The guy at the bottom of that story . . . What is a great moment in a film?|0
This movie is not just good , its amazing . Besides providing us with good performances , original plot , a great director , an interesting cast , and great performances . This movie is not only good , it also provides us with an amazing cast and a great story . It is also not only good that we have a good team , we have a great actor , a great director , a very nice director , and a wonderful acting , so it is only a matter of time . We also have an amazing cast , a great story , a great actress , an interesting actress , a very good cast .|0
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century. But i'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst.This movie is not what you would expect. Yes it is a vampire movie, but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl. I wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer.|1
I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy sex. When she finally returned I was so surprised to see this girl and I wanted to scream at her to get out of the theater and to have another go. However, I did not know what had been going on. I had not seen her in a while and had been unable to recognize her at the screening, which was about to conclude. She had not been watching the movie or going into the movie, and she was not in the theater.|0
I must say : out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out . It’s pretty cool . And I can’t find any references to any of those films in my book . It’s one of those movies I wouldn’t mind seeing in a theater or in a movie theater, but the one I liked so much about is “Korean Boxing” . It’s really just a boxing match between two koreans . I haven’t seen one in the movie theater I’ve visited, so maybe it could be a little interesting .|0
Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version (outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact), but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather lackluster, and schizophrenic, production. And, as with all the other versions of Mansfield Park out there, the character of Fanny Price is no where to be found. Instead there is a strangely child-like, bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character.|1
Never I have seen a movie so terrible that i 've gone insane . It was a HUGE waste of time . i have seen some movies and I cant understand them so bad that they are horrible . i was just shocked by this movie . its so gross . its so ridiculous that they are even gross . when they are the worst films in history . . i was just shocked at the stupidity they are so good that i would not be surprised if they were great . how many people have seen this ? i just watched it .|0
The finest short I 've ever seen . Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened , due to the way in which it can be used. Here, however, I use only the longest I 've saw . The shorter the better! It has been known for years as one of my favorite short TV shows, but it can be as effective as ever, with each episode lasting more than an hour. And, it's no wonder, I just love the show as much as the characters. But, that's not why you love it!|0
This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters, but never got around to it. When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001 I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness, anxiety and joy.|1
Being a former MST3k watcher, even I found this movie unwatchable. The awful attempts at humor-heck the awful attempts at acting. Nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk.I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow--they are all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me a couple of bucks and I can make a movie better than this. One of the most incompetent pieces of film-making I've ever seen and that's saying something.|1
While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world , I think it is better than most over there for us to see something that we can understand, and that is the first film that we have seen since the movie. If you’ve been to theaters, you have probably seen “The Hunger Games.” You’ve seen the Hunger Games, you are a huge fan of the first movie (which you will see in the coming months), so you know you should go back to the movie.|0
This movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. All the attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes I ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through. At least I was entertained. The ghosts are attempting to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name I didn't care to remember. And what was with the black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. And where the heck did that guy (John Corbett's character) come from?|1
I had never heard of this film and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan . Now I was looking at some of the movies that I liked in the last few years, and I thought I was going to like this one. This is a very good movie and I loved it. I have to say this one is the better one and if you don’t see it then you probably won’t like it anyway. So here’s the final review: I have to say I am going to recommend this movie as it has the best sound of any I have ever experienced.|0
(Possible ?? spoilers included, but nothing critical given away. )I just watched this classic low budget movie on video, and was knocked out by the level of energy present on screen. All the actors do themselves proud, especially John Daniels, must see another of his films. Not only does this movie boast great performances, but manages stylish sequences, like when the baron throws someone out of a window and we see shards of glass falling into a swimming pool which erupts from the impact of the fallen man, i love the way slow-motion photography was used in 70's cinema, dreamy and hypnotic.|1
The stage star Grace Hayes stars in this obscure little film . After years of being on the stage , Grace’s career has been in the spotlight since her debut as a teenager on BBC One. The film is based on her life, including her early work as a singer and her career as a songwriter in the 1960s, with many other songs written during her time on the TV show. Grace has worked with a variety of other bands and artists since her time on the stage, and she has been a vocalist for more than 20 years.|0
What a terrible misfire. Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda, George Segal vehicle of a few decades ago. Why? I wonder, someone with the clout of Jim Carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. He could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. Money, money, grosses, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs.|1
"Uggh! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s! What lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! It's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s ""Hanna-Barbera"" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful Tom and Jerry cartoons. However, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired by MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons!"|1
The wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture . It is a monument to what filmmaking once defined as a man-made process: to build on the beauty of the original. It is a great thing to create a picture, but there is no more important thing. “It has been a really great honor and a great honor to do a movie and I am happy to see this movie come out of it. It is really wonderful to see, and it’s wonderful to see the beauty of what I have been making now.|0
"mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big winery and the small one. it's not just about size of of your vineyard but also the amount of money and power you have. if you have enough money to place ads in the wine spectator and hire a so called ""wine except"" then it doesn't matter the size of your estate. also in business world of today wine often has to mass marketed and suited to people's taste. what is means many times wine filtered of it's origin."|1
Dude ... I liked Buffy and Angel as much as the next sci-fi freak ... but this is too much for the rest of my friends who have no idea what the hell that is! I know for a fact this is what you say. But don't go trying to hide in the backseat and tell yourself it's not true. This is just what you would think you are doing! And you will be shocked when you see how ridiculous this is and how much you hate it. But don't try to get your head around it.|0
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios.|1
Mario Van Peebles tries to go the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL to preserve himself, however the government isn't going to take this lying down, so among the simplistic plot Van Peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film. This blatant rip off of Universal Soldier (Which is far more fun then this) simply goes nowhere. The main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert. Van Peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify a viewing.|1
"I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. There is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive--the subject matter or David Arquette's ""performance"". It was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off, although I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers should find something about Sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, I don't know, his TALENT AS A SINGER!!!!)."|1
When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason, the best thing is to watch the show and try to understand how to make it look as real as possible. That way I can watch a real-world show in an entertaining way, that makes it more realistic than ever before. No matter what type of show you are watching, most people who watch it will agree that it has to be a good one. That’s why there are many movies and video games to choose from and there are so many other reasons to choose from.|0
I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I reckoned he might be a good stand-up comedian/actor in the style of Richard Pryor.I couldn't have been more wrong. This concert was awful. It was full of racist comments directed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clichéd cod-philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform.|1
"The first few minutes of this movie don't do it justice!For me, its not funny until they board the sub and those hilarious characters begin to gel. I was born and raised in Norfolk Virginia and met my share of ""different"" sailors- I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are just funny, not topical, not dependent on sex or violence and funny every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still funny even after I know the dialog by heart. Kelsey Grammar with his ""God I LOVE this job!"|1
"This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets, without ever flapping it wings (like it was on a string, perhaps? ), attacking model trains and toy cars. The ""science"" is asinine - a masonic atom gun?? And what's up with the enormous amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I guess the 50's were the Slimeball decade! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from ""some god-forsaken anti-matter universe"", and it's here to build a nest & lay eggs in New York."|1
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters . Steven ( Andy Freeman ) plays his part in the story of a young man who finds out the secrets of the human race when he falls in love. As Steven is looking for him and finds his way to some of the world's most unlikely creatures , he runs into a girl named Ellie . She, however , has fallen in love with Steven . She is attracted to her , and as she sees Steven , Ellie turns on her to find out the truth , which she has always wanted to know .|0
If you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting , jokes , props , and everything else, then it is very important to do a little research as well to find out what has actually happened, or what we could do to remedy it. To start with, you have to have an objective understanding of the actual events at the moment and a reasonable understanding of how the event happened. It is important to know that you have an objective understanding of what is actually happening, and that is what we will do, if we have time, to figure out what happened.|0
I mean really , really , REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment . I do n't think that this film will be seen by much as much as it is seen by the audience at the same time. I think that this is the best movie I have seen for a year and I am quite surprised that the audience has any interest in it at all . I am not sure if it will be seen this time in theaters or not . I know what you are saying, but I would not expect to see it when I see it at the cinema, either.|0
1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): Fast-paced, frantic animation effort by Ted Turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. I'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. Mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to Disney efforts like Aladdin and Lion King.|1
We all enjoyed the movie . It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos . It was a hit with many fans , the actors , the production , the film and the people. I enjoyed it as much as the other movies in the movie. I enjoyed the film and loved watching the movie because I have enjoyed it all for a long time. I like watching movies of the films, but this one is different. That is the way it works. This movie is different because there is a bit of filler and filler and filler.|0
Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing , this is the main pleasure I get when I have an audience of people laughing. There is a lot of fun to be had at this type of show, and with a great cast, I feel like I would like to see more of the films that people enjoy. A few weeks ago, I decided to start a new job in the cinema. It was really hard, and I didn't really have the resources to move on.|0
In case you dear readers never heard , this movie was the main inspiration for last year 's Samuel L. Jackson’s musical masterpiece The Shining , which was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in 2010. Last year he was nominated for a Best Actor in a Supporting Role in Jackson’s music drama “Bethlehem.” This was a time when the movie industry was starting to change and that’s just part of the fun factor in this world of entertainment. But how do you choose the best actors? How do you select the best directors?|0
I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int ' l Film Festival . It is extremely absorbing and fascinating to watch, I would not have known it would take me so long, so I thought . . . But I am not going to put this documentary before anyone . . . So I decided to come and visit and try my luck with it . . . What was it? Where is it? Why did this film be taken on the streets? And what is it? Oh, it's been around for ages, I guess, but it seems so odd to be so long.|0
This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town in South Texas. This was the second film that I filmed in this little town. I didn’t spend all of my time working on this film, but it is very hard to put into words what I’m talking about today. I was in the midst of filming my first film, a documentary in which I was one of a team of filmmakers who filmed several films in the 1980s.|0
"Now , I like the Bollywood films and I 'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK. It is a big achievement and I'm happy for them and I will continue to be a big fan of both films. That is a great achievement for me.”

“So, it's really exciting and I hope they continue to be a success on both occasions and we can have a big impact on these films as well. And they have a great cast and crew and you can't do that without the best producers and directors."|0
"Pure schlock from beginning to end . The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on the past few years, because of it’s ability to “reinvent our world.”

As far as I know, Schlock has been around a long time ago. He’s a kid from a family of 5s and 8s living in the East End of Sydney. But it wasn’t long ago that he did something he’d like to do. It’s a new way of thinking about life."|0
This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person . The sound tracks are a mix of many influences that were added to the movie before its release . The story is one of the best I have played since I can remember , but the music was not made by me as much as it was in the movie . If you were to review this film and listen to the soundtrack for the first ten minutes of the movie the first track will sound a bit different because of the difference in the song.|0
There was a recent documentary on making movies , that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about making a film. The documentary’s title was called ‘Making The Movies’. It was about the film, and it was told that he was making a film. He wanted to write his script and make the script. And I told him that I had a great idea. He started making the film and wanted to film a documentary. And after that, I wanted to make more movies. I’m good with that.|0
"""Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s. A culture of joy and sadness specific to working class Blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture. The characters of Santiago-Hudson's play depicted Black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love,loyalty and honor. Although the characters moved away from those values at times, they did not deny the importance of the values. Instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters, without judgment, that passed through the life of ""nanny""."|1
Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want. I as a fan did not want a 1920's Evil Nazi movie. What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, as we don't REALLY know what became of her. I also would have liked to get Ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic, that sort of thing.|1
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife. I suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me.But putting that aside, I found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also,the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead Vincent Spano.I have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies I missed during that decade.|1
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.This movie is well cast, written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish.|1
This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos . It 's done really well but is it good enough to move forward . The first two are good but what happens is that the third is weak and weak but it is also weak and it is so much easier to keep it away . And the third and fourth are too strong . . . the third and fourth are both really weak . And the fourth and fifth are good . . . the first three are strong enough . . . but the third is really weak but the fourth and fifth get so much better .|0
"This amusing , sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940 's and 1950 's stars Robert DeMille and Al Capone (see ""I Don't Care I Didn't Make It"", for example) is one of the most fascinating and well-researched films of its generation. It is a brilliant film, with great originality, and a wonderful story. My first impressions are that I have never seen the film, so this is a good place to start. First, the screenplay. I have never read anything written before for this movie."|0
Mel Welles , you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman 's Little Shop of Horrors , directs a movie about a woman who makes a career out of trying to get money from the United States. When he went out to New York he said to the director, 'I need some money from you to go to New York. If I don't get what you're looking for, you'll get something from a bank.' He said the next morning, 'Are you interested in New York, Mr. Mushnick?'|0
Disney-like entertainment with some un-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references . Lousy comedy alongside cliché-ridden moralizing . Noah-esque characters with the worst sexiness on their face . Lousy characters with the easiest of sexual references . I know, I know – that’s the way to go – but they are so much fun . I remember when I was 10 years old. I used to run around a playground and pretend to be a little child, and I remember getting the call – “I can’t believe how good it looks – I’ve been watching you for hours.” You know who I mean?|0
One of the best 'guy' movies I've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion. Gad, the scenes...Raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall... A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Lest we forget! Lest we forget!U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _Brooklyn_. They were carrying Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow.|1
Uggh ! Hanna-Barbera of the 60s and 70s ! What lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by our parents ! We’re going to show how they do that. By the time we get into the spirit of this blog, I’ve learned a lot about comics and comics comics. The first few weeks will be interesting to me as a reader. The last two weeks have been great. And the first three weeks are a great way to get a feel for how comics are made. This first week is going to be fun and to make comics feel like stories.|0
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. The special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the storyline was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. I didn't watch the whole movie. When it was played for about one hour I switched off my DVD-player.|1
The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film, on the other hand, is amazingly insipid and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley, I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be this bad. The actors go around and act very showy. Except for Law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are near amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. Damon is miscast.|1
This movie , with all its complexity and subtlety , makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen. If you haven't read the film, you should too. I had never seen the movie before because I was scared that I wouldn't get the chance. I had read a review of that film and thought I would enjoy it. But I couldn't do anything about it, and the review went nowhere. I only saw it on DVD. I thought I would like to watch this movie with the other two. This movie is one of the worst.|0
Thats what this movie really takes. A big piece of cheeze. This movie is about a sister and brother Bonnie and Clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the fun of getting away with it? In comes Richard Hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man. A real BAD version of a ladies man. And he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement.|1
I almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot, but the author of it said it was an old movie, and the movie was not original but it’s well-known in the history of cinema. It seems the director didn’t expect the movie to be from the 1930’s, and it looks like he did not expect it. I don’t think so. So, the director thought that the film was from the 1940’s, but the author of the movie thinks the movie should be from the 1930’s?|0
"_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ comes up short.------------ Some other stan wrote the above comment. Of course The Wild Life is no Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the quintessential 80s flica. However, the Wild Life is enjoyable if you're not whiny about mindless movies being mindless movies (especially when you know it's supposed to be a mindless movie in the first place). The little Latino from Scarface is in this movie and he's straight disrespectful (""I got Visa...Masterrrrr Charrrrge!!"")"|1
SPOILER ALERT!!!! This was my son's review of the movie, which he wanted me to post.He wrote this, I swear.With Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz, and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes, they get to go to show business. They team up on the actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar, and makes it in to a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. to get it back. Jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay.|1
"After a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy ""Chainsaw massacre""-feeling, everything falls apart.SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. Anyone who have seen enough of these ""fooled-ya""-movies can figure this out.This movie is mader with one thing in mind: To depict brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? Will this be next for us movie-goers? The torture and abuse of children? Whats wrong with you people? Lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind."|1
"With its ww2 timing , falling in and out of love , and easy on the eye Kira , this is not only a good look , but an eye for all of you , which is why i am here to help you , i don't believe in the word ""love"" , but i know you are very familiar with all of the ""love"" art , and it has been very good to be with you all , and when you come to love something , you have to ""love"" it ."|0
The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its 3 central characters. To what purpose, one may ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives.It starts off with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich too) drawn into the Naxalite movement. Affair, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, seemingly. Only till the heroine forces herself upon them. Not once but twice.|1
Adam Sandler 's movies are my favorite comedies . The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie . This film was my absolute favorite film in all my years of playing in the theater (in my old town) . The Silents of Silencers are my favorite movies . This was the most amazing movie I have ever seen to date . The Silencers of the Silencer is the most unique one . This movie is so amazing . It’s amazing! I can never wait to see them again! This is a very difficult movie to pull off!|0
Having been raised in Canada, I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC. I have seen it numerous times, at many ages in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging around.Every kid growing up can relate to the situation, and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless.|1
Whatever the producer was going for , he missed entirely . The Lone Ranger is not camp , but ``camp,'' even in the best of circumstances when the situation is still in doubt. At the same time , they can take everything that is needed to keep the game going. It doesnt matter how well the player is playing the game , because at this moment they know that they can never make the right choices. I have no idea, but Id like to take this time and give you some thoughts on where you stand on this matter.|0
Move over Manos . Back off Boogens . It does n't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach, FL is where you'll spend your free time. There is nothing much to see here. But there is much that will make your eyes swell. And if you don’t want to spend your time in this beach town, make your own hotel. It’s a great place to have a drink in. That’s one of the reasons why I was born to be in the hotel. You can get a table for a beer and some food.|0
Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both Beautiful films , but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down for the fans. We have been waiting a while and finally received a confirmation email from the author himself. It states that he will be dropping by on Tuesday to see the finished work for a few days. I think I will start a meeting with him as soon as I get a proper answer from his side. I know it has been very easy to get the information I was hoping for. I will let you know how I can do this next week.|0
If you 've ever been to Ukraine , this movie is absolutely hilarious . From teenagers wearing gold chains , you'll not have to fear . The story behind the movie is funny enough that I'm a little hesitant to say this but it's worth pointing out that Ukraine was a small place and there were so few children. However, you know, I didn't get too excited until I read this . The scene where a group of teens are preparing to run away from family is pretty interesting. As a girl, I always thought that the girls would be scared to go after their friends.|0
In order to pull off a job like this caper in Rififi (e.g. The Score and its opines), one has to have nerves of steel. This one apparently demands and commands it. Jules Dassin is the master.I was on the edge of my seat throughout. It deserves to be better known, even though it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, one supposes, to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical Hollywood of its day.I would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it.I cannot give it enough stars.|1
"The revisionist history -- making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough . But the more I look at the history, I am reminded of a few of my favorite lines in the novel. These are the first two lines I have read, so I will give you the last line in the excerpt below:





I know it's all been said! But the first time I read the book, my husband, who I loved and who had a special place for me with his wife, and the last line I read, he said, ""I wish my wife could read this."|0
This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of `` Next Generation '' and `` Voyager''.I have also seen a lot of the series as a result of having watched it from the other end of the spectrum.I think it is a great example of the difference between getting a good series and getting a bad series.You have no idea how to get started on these episodes, so you may be wondering why I have made such a big mistake.I have already seen a lot of episodes, and I am going to show a little bit more here.|0
"Set in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish.Mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy. But then what else would you expect with a title like that?There is not a lot of dialogue in the film. Rather sparse in fact. It's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests."|1
Yes , indeed we have a winner- a winner in best dumb-action-movie ! The only reason I chose to vote this way is because my friends have a better score! But why? Well, as far as my friends are concerned, they are playing dumb-action movies. This means that it would be very easy for me to change my vote, but it would be hard to change the vote with that vote! The reason why you can change your vote, is that if you vote for someone else, it will not affect the votes of others.|0
Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.By the way, what has become of Ms. Driver? She had such a potential in the film industry.This to me was almost like an 1850s version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With the death of her father, Driver takes a position as a governess to a Christian family, hiding her Jewish identity.While I realize that this is a period peace, it was awfully dull even for 1850 England and Scotland.The lady of the house is most irritating with that sing-song voice of hers.|1
"If it was possible to give negative stars I would for this stinkburger.Don't get me wrong I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good crappy movie. I am a big fan of films like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. Real classics of B-Cinema.But this film actually makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an academy award winner!! The Dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. ""I will now Condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. The acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.The story?"|1
I am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes. I feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this film is going to end.The premise is simple enough, rabid dog on the loose in a small town, kills people. Great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror.Uhh ..no.The main problem is this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz its boring!|1
I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than I would have thought. I don't know if the director/writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't.|1
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values and are not offensive because of their moral values is not a very useful and useful tool. But for this to be useful, the movies and novels are needed. So, a movie needs to have enough characters, that they can be played with without being offensive to people. And that has been the rule since the early years of film. But, in a recent report from the Daily Mail, they have found a way of finding out whether a book can have enough characters.|0
This was the first Chan film made by Monogram . What a come down from Fox values and standards ! A lot of this is true for the film as a whole, but for Monogram there is always a difference. And I don’t even remember if he made the first film, so to say. But the only difference between the two is how many times they are shown together, how well they are doing. But that is not how they work. They are shown as part of a process of creating the film.|0
lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters it was perfect too. I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. Rupert have a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor, so it deserves that and more.|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film , I would have told you it was a horror and that it was probably some sort of monster movie, as I know if you watched it in theaters , I would have been very disappointed in my eyes. I will also be watching the film again for my birthday this summer and will see if I get my wish again . . . . . This is what I was saying to myself after watching it. I know that I was hoping the movie would turn into a horror or a horror horror and if so what is wrong with it?|0
After watching this film , I thought to myself , they really glossed up Errol Flynn 's life ! The first time they made him come in contact with you, they didn't even mention his death, but they said it was the best he'd ever had. And he was a great guy. So why did you say this? I had a long time ago called and had heard he was going to be a major film director. I told him about this, and he told me to ask him why. When I told him this I didn't have much to say.|0
In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously . The movie is called Arachina , and the only thing I have to say is that as you know I would not be able to put the story in the front of an audience that would not understand this movie . Also , the main thing is that while the plot in this film is very strong , the main thing that would really upset me is the plot of the movie , not the story of its main character . I have seen some good movies, but I don't want to put it in the front of a audience .|0
When I was five years old, it was my favorite television show. I remembered it was on channel 11 at 2PM everyday. The show's premise was simple with Carole and Janis as the hostesses of this children's television show. They sang songs and read stories to us as children. It was done in a studio with only 54 episodes which was re-broadcasted over and over. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in the tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract, and the alphabet. For thirty minutes a day now, I learned something new with Paula and Janis.|1
The title does n't make much sense to me . I 'm not sure what door in the movie should mean . I 've never seen this movie . If I did . I can't believe I'm missing something . Oh . . . , . . . No . I can't believe I've never seen it . It's not the opening scenes or anything . They're just some random shots . I can't . It's not even a shot . If this were a shot . How can it . It's just something that happens . You know . .|0
This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny. It's just that there is nothing of interest in this film. There are no real jokes that make you amused, you just watch for 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought this on very budget DVD and I'm glad because it's not worth much. This isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk/high and have a good giggle.|1
"I rented this film from Blockbust because of the Cover and Title! Sounded intriguing!! This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. The ""monsters"" needed more face time. We needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more ""Oh Sh--"" moments. The photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re-breather blows up. There were too many close ups. But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers."|1
This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. Generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of Ice-T and Ice Cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. Don't bother with this one, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal.|1
The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from their first flick, so it may be the last one you’ll see coming out of a theater. Not a bad time, I say. I have been watching this flick with my family. It was pretty much the first flick I saw that I really liked and I still have it in my collection. I got to watch it a few months ago, and I’m happy to be back with a new collection, which is the best of them.|0
The Governess was , by far , a very pitiful film . I do not use this word loosely , although it is used in several other contexts. If you want to understand how she did it she played the role of , in contrast to most other films, the role was played as an actor . For her the film was about an old man who lost his head . He lived with his wife for a couple of years. And so on as the film went on she did it again . If you want to make your own sense of how she does it she did so much to create the film.|0
This is without question one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare it to Plan 9, in that it can be so bad, so awful,so dumb, and such a waste of time that I find myself laughing out loud.One of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood, and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
This is a semi fictional memoir of an `` international man '' who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent decades and who became a part of the history of Western civilization. He has made his mark at various stages of his professional career, and has even become a pioneer in his profession. He is also the author of several important books of literary and philosophical interest. His latest book is a book-within-a-story and is published in March. In the book, he writes about his experiences with a new generation of philosophers and philosophers of science, to which he refers in passing.|0
"Krajobraz po bitwie like many films of Wajda is, perhaps, not understandable for the ""rest of the world"". Story based on the few short stories of Tadeusz Borowski, who during WWII was the prisoner of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen camps. Borowski in his books describes inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view vorarbeiter Tadek - porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself. He describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation."|1
I find it amazing , that so many people ( probably Poles ) have voted for this movie , giving it 5 stars. I think even if the audience had voted for it 5 stars, they would have not voted for it. After watching the movie , I can only imagine how it would have gone if there were other movies like The Hunger Strike , or any of the others. I am glad that I watched this movie and thought it would make a very entertaining movie . It is really hard to describe , but it is very hard to take for granted the experience that goes into it.|0
How awful is it ? Let me count the ways : 1 ) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts in a town where the locals have no idea where to start and ends in a remote country where they can only get lucky with the local people in the local government, they do not know who they are and so in the next scene, there are two police officers with guns and they do not know anything about the local people, there are several other characters that are being trained for this movie, they are being sent into the country and they do not get to see the actual police.|0
I looked forward to seeing this movie , because the trailer made it look so cool . But the fact is the movie had an awful lot of bad reviews , it made it difficult to buy or rent the film and I would have no idea what to do next to see the movie , but it did a fantastic job ! And it was an amazing performance , it is so fun to watch the movie , it is so awesome to play with the characters , and I can't wait to see the movie again soon . And the movie was also pretty good.|0
This is definitely a touching movie , and a great expression of Charles Darwins personal struggle . The movie is a little rough at times . I think the movie has the potential to bring people closer . The film is well-written , well-handled . I like it too . It’s very interesting and very funny . The story is a little bit off , but still funny . It was very funny . The ending is very good . The director and actors were very happy . The director’s performance was excellent as well .|0
"this is one of my favorite movies ever! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust, this is near perfect cinema. rex allen narrates this wonderful tale of a cougar who just needs a little loving. contains action, adventure, suspense, comedy, and riverbed chaos! SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE TO KILL TO DO IT!!! you will not find a better cat picture anywhere, with ""cat from outer space"" coming in as a not so close second. charlie's performance is magnificent. even includes animal cruelty and intense logging! gotta love disney, for all moral failures!"|1
This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse , the acting or plot. It's been about three years and its been over two dozen times. I mean the first three were a joke but that doesn't help. The rest are pretty good. But what about the other 2 movies which have been very well-acted. It's time to get the fuck out and get it over with. I mean that is what I've been looking for but I've never really been able to get over it.|0
OK, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book I turn to to fill in the time. I have 3 copies for god's sake. anyways, I knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on! They could have done a little better than this. I mean seriously if I wanted to watch American werewolf in Paris or London than I would watch those movies.|1
Let 's get right to the heart of the matter ... This is a terrible movie . The story is set in New Orleans, New York City where a group of people have been recruited and executed for the murder of a couple. A gang of criminals are being brought together, trying to kill the young man whose murder is the cause of the deaths of three young ladies. What happens next comes as a shock to our intelligence officers, as there is a possibility that there is a plan to kill the couple. The plot goes on and on.|0
I think Trash really sucks. I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I haven't seen that kind of c**p at the cinema since Female Trouble by John Waters and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; it really stank, it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But actually I am glad I saw it, because then I could tell my honest opinion on it. One should see this film, even though it stinks.|1
Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire, and, of course, Timothy Dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. I wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! But Dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow.|1
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.Replace outer space with the South African desert,throw in the same ingredients,a group of people stranded in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film. A group of miners and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh.Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilisation while being stalked by the monster.|1
I have no qualms with how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Fine. Whatever. I lived there WAY long enough. I don't need to see a movie that captures the Garden State.What I do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. Let's make it easy on you. We'll use some bullet-points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie ANYWAY): -The music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing.|1
"Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters! I cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie. This film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like.This film is about a young boy, Alejandro ""Ale"" who works and lives with his teenage sister, Isamar ""Izzie"" in a one-room tiny loft in an auto shop. The story takes place in a part of New York City (that I did not even know existed--Willits Points) where there are endless junkyards and body shops."|1

'Carolina Moon ' is an adequate made-for-TV movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town wheresheep of a woman with psychic powers for the next few years. The character was first introduced to America in an episode of the series in 1977. She is portrayed by Susan Sontag. In 1977, she is cast as the title character in a comedy film, and later was cast as the main character in a television series based on a true story set in New Orleans, Louisiana. She is portrayed by J.T.R. Johnson.|0
I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many sight gags, non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode, there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. But unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode.|1
This is one of my 3 favorite movies . I 've been out on the water since I was 13 years old and have no clue what I am doing with my life and how to get it all over the place, so I thought I'd give it a go! I've done this a lot, so here are some suggestions on what to expect, and do not be surprised if I get a few hours in to see the movie. I'm not a huge fan of old school movies so there is no way I can't have one of these in my life.|0
"Yah . I know . It has the name `` Sinatra '' in the title , so how bad can we have to deal with that? :-(
<Amitah> I would prefer not to be here all day. The problem is not that I don't get what is needed. I like that you can put a message like this:
<Rudolph> Hi all! I have a problem with the install. I have installed the ubuntu kernel on my desktop but I can not see anything in the installation screen."|0
"I just caught this on Showtime ... ewwwwwww , not even fun in a bad movie kind of way . iphone , not even funny . Dude, that was awesome and i was sooo excited to see the movie

Hmmm...i was hoping to find something that would show you more of the same with some more of the same movie

I'm not sure if those two things would fit in one box of the same movie but i could find some other interesting things on the same page and then i'll have some more interesting things for that."|0
OK , I read the director 's comment about this movie ( featured as the 'frontmost comment ' ) , and it turned out that they have a great deal on the final script ( ) , but it is a shame that he didn't finish it , so I am very sorry for having to watch the movie. Thanks in advance , I really appreciate the help and will watch it. Also you should read the trailer ( ), because I really didn't want to spoil something with the movie as it was a great movie.|0
If you 're coming to this film to learn something about depression , forget it : you wo n't learn much in the world of film like this.' I was talking about this film that I never saw, so I wanted to make something with my camera. I wanted it to be so easy to see, easy to watch, just as easy to put on as you put on . If you didn't have a film camera you could never get good at it : you can just get a good photo and watch it as you watch it.|0
Night hunter is a sold B style action movie . Get a life and grow up people . Don ``t have time to enjoy watching this movie, it's just worth a watch. . If there is one thing I don't like when watching something that I've seen before or after it, then it is getting in the way of its life. . There are a lot of people out there who say they can only watch the film for a couple hours a day , just because I don't like it when they watch it and I can't really understand why.|0

"OK, if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies, then you will have a lot of fun with this. Otherwise, it may really be TOO painful to see.Plot: Obsessed cryptozoologist sneaks a huge crate containing a Chupacabra onto a cruise ship (apparently not having to declare it at customs, or even mention that he's bringing aboard a live animal -""no really, it's research equipment, the air holes are just an accident""). Some dipsticks he hired to lade it open the crate, figuring he paid bunches of money, maybe there's something to steal."|1
This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture, to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived, breathed, and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short, and I'm glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school, this was required reading in both languages.I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story.|1
I really do n't know much about the Marquis de Sade , not having read any of his book , it would be great if you could take it down to the end of this page. I can't find the link at all , but I'm sure that if I had, I would get to learn a lot of the stuff about him. Thanks for sharing your story!! I would love to learn the rest of the book to help you. This is my first visit here and I was not prepared to start over.|0
"It 's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of a director's skill can't find their footing."" ""And what would you suggest?"" she asked. ""The idea is that there's no such thing as an indie movie in a low budget movie theater, and no one can get that kind of thing done, even if it's a short film, so no one can buy it."" ""You're saying you would try it? It's cheap!"""|0
Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career , spanning over 300 movies . With a budget that’s almost half of $200 million, Corman is on the verge of a return to his most profitable film of 2011 . He made several movies with the budget that he hopes would be his last, including “Dangerous Liaison,” which earned $11.9 million. He is a naturalized American. But that’s not going to change when he leaves the big-budget film business. Corman isn’t making a movie. He’s a filmmaker.|0
I was expecting a lot from this movie, and I can say I haven't been disappointed. First of all, this movie, as a world tour of wine making, let the spectator enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and funny too, in particular Hubert de Montille. The shooting may be confusing, the camera always being unsteady and often focusing on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You may not like it, but I don't consider it as a defect.The themes raised in the movie may be kind of confusing as well, since globalization isn't the only issue discussed.|1
Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter. But in spite of that single fact, this is not a bad little thriller, considering the low budget, the low quality effects, the stiff acting and the Sci Fi Channel aspects. The blood effects are very convincing, and the Chupacabra actually looks realistic... regardless of what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking Chupacabra.Aside from the positives, this runs kind of like Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?)|1
As much as I love the story of David Copperfield , I can not claim to have enjoyed this movie, but the film was enjoyable and enjoyable, and I liked it a good deal. However, if you are in the US , you will likely have read about David Copperfield , because the film is a bit of a mystery . The mystery itself is the plot of the movie. I was in the US and enjoyed it a good deal, as there were some issues with the cinematography of the film and the editing of the plot.|0
The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not , admittedly , all that original . Young lovers are the most beautiful people in their own way . This story is no different . It starts with a young guy who falls in love with his ex-girlfriend . He is the one that finds out and decides to end his life by giving her back his beautiful body . However, his body is also the one that finds out and takes her back to her old home . While he isn’t the best guy in his town , it is the girl who gives him back his love.|0
River 's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one . Having viewed it over a few days, it's hard to believe that he was able to keep the audience interested, even when they were not. There are so many options out there for all of us to watch but it's been so fun watching such a film! It's been fun to watch and I'm glad I did too! So thanks for coming on to the show, I hope to see you soon too . Hope this is going to be a great experience .|0
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD ( and it 's follow-up { Female Prisoner Scorpion } ) and I have decided to do it as it has been very enjoyable for me. So I have done this DVD as it has been very enjoyable and it has been a really good project. I have said it before, but I will say now that it 's also a pleasure to be in with this DVD. That is why I started this project as I thought I should give this a shot at it. I did this as it has been extremely enjoyable for me.|0
"HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY?!!!!!!!! There's nothing new in ""The Big Green"". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Police Academy"", ""Cocoon""). Why, OH WHY, did he have to do these sorts of movies during the 1990s and beyond?! So, just avoid this movie."|1
I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful . There are very few laughs that can really get a kid to cry. The only one that is funny in this case is the one that has been in the movies for a long time. The story is a simple one-shot-in-place story of a young boy who is in trouble in a small town, in a small town. He is taken to an abandoned city, he finds that he is homeless and is forced to find shelter in the city.|0
A vg Brit rom-com, one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising, this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest), though it does have a unique charm. Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honest and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more.|1
Oh boy ! Oh boy ! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and it looks really good! If you are wondering, why is it so much better to wear it on a beachfront? I mean, you can't wear it off the beach without knowing what the real purpose of that cover is. So, you know I've had to keep on with it all the way up to the top. And I have to tell you guys that I don't have a great answer for what you want me to say.|0
"In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime , i stumbled upon this site in the last week. The site is the latest example of what is to come in the long term, and i don’t know why i did so in the first place — i just found a few more. i think i got a lot more from this post than i had expected

So, why did you bother to look at this site? Do you think some of the images in this site were actually the same ones that you had seen earlier?"|0
"My Mother Frank begins as a warm , amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman ( Frank , short for Fräulein Frank, or ""Frank's Mom"" or ""Für-Ein!"") who finds herself trapped in the Catholic Church (the Church of Christ in Germany ) for a year, trying to keep out of her bed. She finds that the priest-like nature of the Catholic Church has led to her falling in love with the woman, and eventually has to find her way back to where she began, as well as get out of church and find a job."|0
This is a beautiful , yet simple movie about one man , driven to find an answer , an answer that never came to pass . He , in his search for what he knows is not found , takes his chance and starts looking for a place to be found , but never finds the answer he needs . He finally finds the right place, but that is not the problem . In this , a man has no other choice than to kill himself, but in a very simple way . The answer he needs is a place he cannot find .|0
Peter Strauss, by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films, often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film, having channel-hopped into it half-way through. Well, I've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film! !Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much....|1
In fact it was awful . The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director in it and she got topless too but I'm sure that is not the way most chicks do it, she was sleeping with the director who was the one that got topless on the screen. So it's really weird, but not really it is . It's really awful . She got topless on screen, it was a little funny, I guess I'll find a new way to laugh out of it .|0
Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world . In this episode, he talks with his friends and a group of adult children about how and why fantasy and imagination can be both a powerful tool and a necessary tool in the lives of children and adults alike. In the last installment,Resnais discusses his work with a group of people in England and Wales , including a writer and a friend of his. This interview with Resnais is also available for free online or by e-mail.|0
"The Internet is a wondrous thing is it not? I am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries, ""Vietnam:The Ten Thousand Day War"", from my DVR in Florida USA to my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would like to just say that for Minh Nguyen to make the statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one sided. I know America was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to wage war."|1
this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC. from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best, if i hadn't have known better, i would have thought there was an elaborate script here.what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity.peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal.|1
Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic , but yet again its just another example of what’s missing in the industry. You may not know how the rating is calculated, but there are a number of ways the ratings are different. Most of the time, the rating is a measure of the quality of what you say you are able to make. This makes the rating even better. For example, on my site I show you something like this: I think you have a rating that is a percentage of a website, but it appears to be not.|0
This is another of Robert Altman 's underrated films ( let 's be honest , the only movie he 's been in, this is a great movie). However, you need to understand why Altman and his work on this subject have become so popular and influential in movies and video games alike. Trying to create a better, more entertaining video game experience on a computer is not a good idea. ( I am not saying it isn 't fun, it is a great idea ! ) This movie was made a couple years ago with the same goal of a more fun and enjoyable experience on a portable gaming PC.|0
"Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the world's second highest mountain, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed. ""K2"" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film.Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time rock climbing."|1
What ever happened to shows with united parental figures ? The parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the parents in some cases. It’s the same with reality shows like ‘I Wanna Be Gay’ and ‘What Happens To Me’. This was the sort of show that people who don’t know how to say things like “this isn’t how it works,” “this can’t be what it does for you,” “this is a bad movie,” and the rest of it was pretty much the same as it was with the last show.|0
This great film never showed up in my town, so actually I didn't have any opportunity to watch it until the late 80'es when I caught it on German television. I was expecting something of a disaster, and found instead a well-acted grand western with superb location work. The tiny tube couldn't really damage it and there's almost not a dull moment in this 4-hour film, so I hope to see it once again on the big screen. What a spectacle that would be! Don't miss it, if you ever have the chance.|1
Imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can. Add more plot holes than plot. Have it scripted by a 10 year old. Have the acting done by A-Level drama students faking really bad US accents (in the Isle of Man!) Add monster special effects that the lovers of B&W Dr Who shows will appreciate. Result: duff film. Throw in Samantha Janus taking her clothes off (make a point of this on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!|1
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado, played to perfection with expert timing and panache, don't watch this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in 1930's english gentlemen's private club society, this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good intro to Gilbert and Sullivan, but after this, rush out and rent the Canadian Stratford version. You'll see the difference between good and great. Nobody does G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.|1
This movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the Left Behind series. I did not know it would be a Bible-thumping movie. I expected it to truly be a movie about UFOs and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. As previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. I felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones.|1
"Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough? ), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!)"|1
After the success of Star Wars , there was a boost in interest in Sci-Fi movies . This was one of the first things that had to be done in order to get it in theaters. In fact, it was a very, very big step in Star Wars history. With the development of this movie, many people have been talking about Sci-Fi films for a long time. However, Star Wars and Star Trek have been pretty close to one another, and Star Wars was the first film produced by Star Wars Films and had an overall impact on Star Wars film history.|0
Hey guys and girls ! Do n't ever rent , or may God forbid , buy this piece of garbage , or maybe just not. If you want to have it, then just come with me so we can discuss what's good, how to get it , and we'll start the process. If you would like, you can email me and tell me when you have any more ideas. We'll go over the process in more detail in this post. So you can go out of your way and say all kinds of stuff that can make you feel better!!|0
"I am utterly astonished at how over-rated ""Cemetery Man"" is among horror fans! Now, I usually welcome movies that blend two or more kinds of genre-styles into one and I love just about every zombie-comedy I have ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult-classic really didn't show me a lot to get too pumped up about... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time cemetery care-taker and his retarded, man-child, Curly Joe looking assistant as they seem to primarily dispose of the recently deceased who pop out of the ground seven days after their initial death."|1
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull. Well, after watching one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I popped this sucker in. It was worse than I had expected, and I didn't expect much. This movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob, and other bull crap. There was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on. Now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore, can somebody tell me were?|1
"This movie is a great film . The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film . Driving is one of the best scenes in the movie and I am glad to see many of the scenes that are in it . I know this movie is about driving . The main theme of the movie in the film is ""getting into the car"" and as we all know it is the greatest car ever created . In the movie it is about getting into the car. This movie is about getting in the car and then trying to stop it after it goes into the water ."|0
I had never heard of this film and only got it because I am a Martin Sheen fan. Now I am stunned as to why it did not receive the praise and recognition that it truly deserves. The four characters all make you feel for them, the father trying to assert his authority, the mother still clinging to traditional family values and both trying to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter wanting her own life and the son haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario that must have been played out in thousands of 'ordinary' families after Vietnam.|1
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film , after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the film on my personal TV, it would seem it is still not quite so much what you think, but a movie like it. After a while, this is what I’d say, but I never saw it. I had to make sure I was watching a film in the right direction before I realized that it was not just a bad movie. It was a lot of fun. When I first saw it, it was so much fun, and I enjoyed the entire movie so much.|0
Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen . Here are my favourites in the film, and the film’s cinematography and editing skills will help make it your favourite. If you’re not familiar with the movie or film, we’ll leave you to it! This one is the most boring one in cinema, so please try it out. Here is what it looks like before release, which you may have to pay £20/month or more to try it out. It’s just a bit different, but it looks better.|0
First off , I 'm not a firefighter , but I 'm in some kind of para-firefighting unit ( the 's ) , how can I do that . I'm pretty sure that there is some way , how can I prove that this is possible. I understand that . I'm wondering , how can I get rid of the dead people ? What is the simplest way ? I think the other way , but , I'm still not sure how I can take the person who is supposed to be killed from this dead body . Thank you and welcome to your site.|0
This is a joke, right? This can't be a real film? It's not even a real video? Give any Harvey Milk High School kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this. The film maker's can't be serious... right? Is this satire? Comedy? Drama gone horribly wrong? The script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay. The dialogue isn't clichéd.|1
Okay , now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from . I do believe they can be read as well . The author is not a cop but he has been in the media and you have all the background info for him, etc. so he could be a cop . Or maybe he doesn't care. The author doesn't have any background knowledge and has no background that would lead to his conclusion. If he is a cop, he has a lot more information to tell the truth. But his main interest is the truth but he is not the only guy with background information.|0
I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She 's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid attention to while making a movie about a woman who doesn't have to be beautiful in her skin. And she did. She made it for me, and I got to watch it! But now that I have made the film with Sandra Bullock, I thought that it would be a great film to make with Sandra Bullock. She's a beautiful woman and a real lady. If you are looking for more of her looks and looks-this is a movie that is really good.|0
Leslie Carbaga's excellent book on the Fleishers tells the whole story of the Fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to Florida, and their subsequent ejection by Paramount. Mr. Bug Goes to Town didn't destroy the animation pioneers' credit with Paramount, although it's often told that way, and this was Paramount's favorite version of the story. According to Carbaga, the big studio, more than anything, wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether. Mr. Bug provided them the pretext to do just that.|1
Yes , thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie . The acting is below-average and the special effects are below average . Is that the problem? . . ? No, because it's not the movie. But if the movie was, for example, directed by a film producer, I'd think the problem had nothing to do with the script. I'm not going to pretend there's anything to the movie. But that would be a major flaw in the script if it had been. And I'm not sure if there is a fault in it.|0
"Anyone that is looking for an episode of ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI"" would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.A murder took place, and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? Sure, the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently."|1
Ridiculous , nauseating doggerel with terrible acting ; ineptly , superficially , and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés for such a dog. The most terrible dog-talker, a dog with no friends and no sense of humour in his vocabulary, a dog with such a silly idea of himself and others that it seems to be the most important thing to be able to relate to. The worst of the worst, the best of the worst . . . I should be ashamed to even say this but if I did, I think I'd feel better. What is a dog ?|0
"Ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, stiff, starchy, and thunderously dull, but with lots of throttling, then head right for ""Lady Frankenstein"", a stagy, costumy Italian corpse-walker. Joseph Cotten(""Citizen Kane"")plays the crusty old Baron himself, and must have really needed to make that condo payment. Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in cow-ntless European B-films, usually as Rosabla Neri, including ""Hercules Against the Moon Men"", plays his ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress."|1
I'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. This was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to Down Below. Unfortunately unlike Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the action took place off station. I didn't care much for Garibaldi after the first three seasons and think Sheridan is okay but no Sinclair. I like Lochley but she only had limited screen time. If you like Crusade or space battles you should enjoy it. Personally I can only give it 1/10.|1
This movie had potential. If it had been handled differently. What it needed was a different director. That's certain. And perhaps a different leading lady. I just can't understand the Minnie Driver character - or at least how she played it. She was completely unbelievable. I cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. She was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do. I am writing this as I am still watching it.|1
Do n't get me wrong , I love most of Paul Schrader 's movies , so it was with sheer good fortune he got a bit of credit for that , and his movies were just good , and I do like them because the movie is the most well-received film of all time with a nice amount of twists . . . and there are many more movies with good twists , but this one I still like. I have always believed that the greatest movies were the ones which did have great sex and violence . . .|0
A film , first and foremost , should be good storytelling . It should be entertaining - and entertaining does not end with being funny , so that is a great thing to have , but not having a great story to tell and telling a story that is funny and entertaining . We want people to have a good story for their stories and we want them to be able to tell and tell a story they can remember for a whole month and not have a long story for months until they come out and tell the rest.|0
The plot involves a new, hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So, he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds real exciting huh. As for the rest of the film, a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. The people that work at Calvin's stand around, talk loud, and mouth off to each other and the customers. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was mildly funny, but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie.|1
It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw, however as the actors are the same I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe differed from the one circulating in the US.Anyway, this was the worst movie that I saw the past five years. (Closely followed by The Waterboy...)Why: Because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one, mixed them, put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it. (Examples: nothing happends, the music gets scary, and still nothing happends.|1
when this show first came to Disney , i love it started watching all the time . It quickly became the most popular animated film ever , and is still a favorite amongst fans. When the show is done , everyone will have watched it and is very happy with the outcome. In this episode we will be introducing you the story of the characters we are talking about, and we will introduce you all the information for the viewers so they can get an idea of the characters and how they look as they go along.|0
A Cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island.To get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto a pirate colony and tries to trade his kingdom for land. The pirate colony is overrun, and he is forced to go into hiding and steal his chupacabra. To his horror he comes across a young man, who believes he has been eaten by pirates, and has found some of his chupacabra. It is his duty to save him, and he saves his chupacabra from the pirates who attack the pirates.The pirates are not aware that the chupacabra was eaten by a young adult pirate who is hunting for them.|0
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion. Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots. (In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India ever..that too just to sri lanka).Mani's class is written all over the movie...and to add to it ARR's music..which is just amazing...Vellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever... Maddy,who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too.|1
The Calu-what now ? Yeah , I thought it was a stupid name as well . Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware that he's the person who is being asked to play the game . All the more reason to play it again and hope for the best . That's my feeling ! I've also had a couple games where Chris Carter played the game and made a joke that if it didn't work out the way it should then it would have been the game I'm trying to make it . That's all I can say for now .|0
Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess, horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Sadly too, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. It's sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes talent doing garbage like this film, and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue.|1
I really enjoyed this movie. Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie, but Bruce Willis learned, from The Kid, that there is more value in repecting others, and his life of disrespect needs to change. This movie was a refreshing change from the trash that Hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. There are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie. I really believe this was one of Disneys best, even though a couple of things could have been left out. I was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual inuendos.|1
Let's get right to the heart of the matter...This is a terrible movie. The story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the lead Actors look like they were forced to be in it. The story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on Peta Wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. The sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she's in pain.|1
Ahh , nuthin ' like cheesy , explopitative , semi-porn , masquerading as horror ... This one stars Jaqueline Lovell, who has been in her thirties and appeared to have had some sort of personality change as a teen. She had a few years ago, and she has appeared in films, which is a bit like being cut from the same movie as she did in her teens. She plays a very important role in the film (as it is for us), and as you know, her character is not a kid.|0
This film is a work of pure class from start to finish , for a moment forget the famous 28-second cut. There were many things you could have done better, yet this one has made a total of 12 movies. It’s quite a different film from what I’ve seen before so this is the final installment of a long, drawn out journey. The main character in the story is a young woman who goes out into the world as her father and mother take up residence in a tiny mansion in the far West of England.|0
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances. This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot, even for 1944, but because of the actors it's still fun to watch. Hayworth isn't even that much of a dancer, but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character. Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs. The movie can also be very serious at times. Not a must-see, but recommended if you like the actors.|1
I saw this turkey in the theater , but I had a good time . The special effects are n't good but the music is a little bit better. Could anyone point me into the details of the music? It's not as hard to understand as it sounds, but I have to say I'm looking for it now. The story is in a good place, I know I have to know more, but I'm not going to sit around and listen to a song in my head while doing my homework and trying to get into the music. It sounds cool.|0
The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger, but it was a good start for all that. As is now common with this Doctor the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a side issue, to be glossed over when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle!|1
The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that took up most of the space that had been reserved by the network and the show. In its first six episodes, the show took over the space formerly occupied by the previous episode of the series and made it to the end of its sixth-episode arc. In its final episode in the show's run, it made it back to the beginning of season two and announced its departure from the show's first two episodes, leaving it with a bit of room to fill until the series concludes.|0
"Admittedly, the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. At any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since ""Jesus of Nazareth."" But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices, but I don't think that it really does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist."|1
"I was hoping that Pulp would be a interesting movie, but was profoundly disappointed.Pulp has very little storyline, and what there is never holds your interest. It was a real struggle to keep watching it. When its over you say to you self ""huh? that's it?!?"". This is one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother?Its too bad since Michael Caine is a good actor. I was also hoping to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute."|1
"This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life . While I like how the director and crew of the movie were doing their jobs, I didn't understand the audience's reaction when the director started shooting the movie. For me, it seemed like it was the film's way of saying: ""this movie is just waiting to be shot,"" the director's job, which was supposed to be the focal point of that film's story, was to tell the viewer that they had been waiting for the right moment for the right place to start the story."|0
"I expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election . CBS 's last shot at throwing a debate with Mikel Cohen of the Chicago Tribune was shot after the election and did nothing. I can tell you from what I read on the Internet on the front page that I think they're going to pick up the movie. ""This is a good movie, it's moving, it brings you back again. We've seen it twice."" I was not sure if it was because of the first episode of The Apprentice or because it is a really boring movie."|0
"Do n't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover ( at least the Swedish version), which is something I found quite odd. I have not had a problem on other projects and have never had any trouble in my own project. I was wondering what I could do to avoid the plot error on my own project as I don't think it will cause any problem. A:

No, I've never had the plot error. The plot will have a different line, the line that contains the value of the first line, and a line that is the same line."|0
Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. His acting as supposed washed up beach stud Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surf hijinks. Guys cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of LA on a Friday night. Duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman.|1
"This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to ""explode soon"" from all the crazy happenings. There was, in fact, nothing in the movie to make that line relevant."|1
"It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the `` thief '' was in place and he was a thief himself. He got out a gun and fired at the thief, shouting at him, and ""you don't know anything about this thief"", he pointed the gun at the thief. He had no way to tell the other thieves he was being arrested for murder or for murder, but it was his own idea. He got up and walked over to a car parked outside the shop."|0
I don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Sure, this may be a zombie flick with some splatter, but thats it. I'm not a hater on zombie films, but this was awful. Really, actually, I should call it more like a zombie-soap, because thats how the acting is. Production is... well, okay. Barely an attempt at plot development, awful acting, silly effects, clichés, and an abrupt ending.|1
At least for me. I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was not crazy about this film. I think Penelope Cruz was miscast, the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good, she makes the character unbelievable. Also, the singing scene was just weird. I do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful.As Spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts are the accents. Why people coming from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense.|1
A couple of clarifying comments are in order . Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release, but a more thoughtful analysis of the interview is in order. The interview begins by describing what she did when she saw the video posted online. This is not the interview that we’d want you to hear, but rather this interview, which I hope you have read and heard. This video was posted to a YouTube channel but I’ll tell you why it is important to keep in mind what you’re saying in the video.|0
Steven Segal's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema. I have been tragically bored with every one of them as soon as I realized that they were even more unrealistic than Jean Claude VanDamme's. Has anyone else ever noticed that he never gets hit?! I mean, give me something to root for...a hard fought battle with a bad guy who's scary. TWENTY YEARS and he's still filming the same fight scenes. Fight scenes can often distract you from the fact that your hero cannot act. The boring choreography of a Segal film places his painful lack of acting skill in sharp relief.|1
I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell ;D), friends while the books were being signed, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed.So as not to spoil anything, I wont go into detail...but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel.|1
"The `` silver screen '' gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life 's rainbows. I'm not even sure what this movie was made for,'' she says, when I ask her whether it was actually meant to be. ""It's something to be taken seriously in a film. Like you can't take a car and drive it around, so you can't just make it look like they're running, like you've been driving for the first couple hours or so."" And the Silver Screen?"|0
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations , Blade is by far one of the best realised characters in cinema, and yet in this video we are shown how Blade is seen in the first person in the series. The first act is the first person shot in the series and the second the third in the comic book. Blade is shot from the right side of the frame , in the time frame in which he has a very good sense of direction, in that he doesn’t have a problem with being the main character for the first few frames.|0
This movie is certainly well-constructed , beginning and ending in the dark , with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt , who plays Schmidt, one of the two-part characters that plays in this film. The ending makes it all the more challenging to understand Schmidt, the new-comer at the film. As we already mentioned , he was the third-most-popular actress in the world, and it was the film that became the focal point of Schmidt's acting career. Before the film is shown in the theater, I'd like to take you a few more minutes to understand what Schmidt was thinking when he introduced this character, this time to Jody.|0
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with Cesare Canevari's 1968 IO, EMMANUELLE starring Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late, questionably great Joe D'Amato. It is much closer in spirit to the now very dated Just Jaeckin film from 1973, taking a pokerfaced look at male/female relationships, questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy, all in luxurious exotic surroundings.|1
"1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10 ( Dir-Brad Sykes ) : Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much looks and acts at the time it has been made and then it starts to act on the scene the next night. A:

In my opinion it makes the game more interesting because the first scene is a lot more action-y. The story starts off with a character who starts off as a kid while the story of the scene starts off in a good way. That's a whole lot more fun that a 2D film. But the story starts off a little differently."|0
First of all, the entire script is mostly improv, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are actual hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government themselves) are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several of the cops are actual policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms alloted by Watkins, eventually come to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot.|1
The initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what? There is a scarecrow murdering people there. Only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people, one by one. Whats the scarecrows secret? Will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. Sound is OK but picture is really corny. The plot/script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical.|1
This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen . I would think you could get that from the trailers . The only reason I think it is okay is because he is the one who created it (and he is a guy who doesn't have to fight for anything). If you watch the first half, you probably can't find the second half because you are not really looking at the real thing. But I can still watch it with my eyes . I think I'm going to have to find another way to find out what he meant by it.|0
I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films . Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in which you have to be there in order for them to be used in action . There is a scene where we go to the cinema where you can have a picture of me and you can see it on the screen . It's a scene where you can go to the cinema and you can see it at the film's start stage . When you look at me when I'm at the film's opening scene I don't see the fight scene .|0
"Ocean's twelve is probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people would disagree, But I actually liked it more. After three years, it was good seeing the gang return. The reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around. I see why they stole from Benedict(Andy Garcia) in the last film. This film they have a bit more motivation the second time around. Ocean's twelve is more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean's eleven. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying ""I just walked in that new Dennis Quaid movie"" and other things."|1
Gritty drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost out big time to masterful productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. Okay, so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'The Street' last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a big fat waste of time. TV (British TV) is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the American productions.There was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'.|1
I have just caught this Movie on TCM , and can understand why George Murphy went into Politics if this is the last straw. And if it was, this would be the most interesting movie ever made. I'm really looking forward to it. I'm not a film nerd, and don't want to be. But I'm curious to see if it can be made into a sequel. I don't have enough money to afford an actual sequel. But if I can make it I might get that.|0
Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful ! ! This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name and it is not Canadian cinema. I know it’s not Canada and I’m saying that because it is Canada. That doesn’t mean a Canadian Cinema, it’s Canada. That’s Canada. The movies I’m saying here are the movies that are great, and this is what you want to know. They’re great because that is why you go to Toronto or Vancouver, Canada.|0
It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them, and imagine myself in their world, the more I get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves, and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion.|1
"If you put Seinfeld aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great! ""The King Of Queens"" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. Doug and Carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves."|1
Normally I don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that I forget almost as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make an exception.Besides the fact that I enjoyed watching Carol Alt, I can't give any rational reason why I watched this movie through to the end. I'm always amazed that good-looking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this, but I suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better.|1
I absolutely hated this movie. Even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a cliché ridden and melodramatic way like a Mexican soap opera.Also the acting was terrible especially Charityn and her son. That's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. I'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means Dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.|1
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me, and i couldn't put it down until the end... and i had forgotten about my horrid day. and the ending... by the way... where is the sequel!! !the budget is obviously extremely low... but ... look what they did with it! it reminds me of a play... they are basically working with a tent, a 'escape pod', a few guns, uniforms, camping gear, and a 'scanner' thing. that is it for props.|1
Well , the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out ... and they seem to get worse every time . So what does this have to do with The Hobbit, and the Hobbit in general? It's not about the Hobbit, its about more of the world, not about the world. And that's why we get the Hobbit on the BBC, but not the book. If you watch the book you'll know why people like it, because it's a film. And that's what the film is. It's a movie about the world.|0
"Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did ""Memento,"" and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes."|1
I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. It's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death.|1
A MUST SEE documentary. -- -- -This movie had so many things to consider while watching it . It was a great film that made me laugh out loud and had so much character . I was so happy watching one of those movies. It was funny . It reminded me of the movie I've never watched before and I was a little embarrassed by it because it was too funny, so it was funny . Then, the second night, I got a call to see if they had a movie on them. Oh, I'm sorry .|0
"One of the commenter's is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made. He shot a film called the ""Electric Chair"" in Pineville, NC. He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! It sucked also. This was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror films were being made in NC. This movie didn't help matters."|1
Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one : he 's co-screenwriter , producer and director of this cartoonish cartoon series, which opens in New Orleans on February 17, 2012 : he works full time on the production side , as the writer, producer, and director of the cartooning, as well as director and creator of the cartoon series himself. I can't wait to see what it turns out to be like! Here we go ! The main storyline in this game was inspired by a movie that happened to be released in early 2011.|0
"Well Folks, this is another stereotypic portrayla of Gay life however, the additional downside includes poor acting, horrible script, no budget, terrible sound and let us not forget the impossible storyline.It is Christmas in New York City and our story immediatly ""focuses"" on two male individuals, apparently lovers for some time. One of them has not let his parents (the right wing, religious zealot types) know that he is gay (adding to the impluasability of the story 'cause this guy is as efeminant as gay guys come these days) and his parents are coming to viusit him."|1
I suggest if you have already seen the original American Graffiti, do not see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I still don't recommend this, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. The characters from the first film are great, and by the end you fell a connection to them. This movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become. It's a chore to watch!Set on New year's eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters from the first film.|1
"Do not see ""Mr. Magoo."" It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny in it. He has not been funny since the Naked Gun movies. Well it won't take long to figure out that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. Nothing in the entire movie was funny. The first few minutes of the film were animated to look like the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie would have stayed that way."|1
The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in the money for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off was shown for about two episodes in Australia but didn't rate; probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the Australian-written script. Bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey.|1
Received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics , they released Irreversible, an art style album of the 1980's which was released in the UK in 1994. The album is one of the best in the history of the genre. There are five tracks of varying genres of music on the album that are currently released on the record label. The first of the albums was a compilation of the first twenty-four singles released in 1989, the second of which was a compilation of all the tracks released between 1987 and 1990.|0
Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudius.|1
How in the world does a thing like this get into my DVD player at home? How does it even get to be packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero screenings a movie (and I use that term loosely) have to go through before it's put on a video store's shelf anymore? I'm all for DIY film making but come on! That doesn't entitle me to get a group of my friends and relatives together, a crappy camcorder, an awful story and put it all together to create a heaping pile of crap and call it a movie.|1
Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young , not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill , telling her story in her native tongue . Natasha Henstridge, who was born as a Jewish woman and is now Jewish, has been with the British royal family for seven years. Natasha Henstridge, 28 , is the young , not-so-grieving widow in the estate on the hill , told her story in her native tongue . She told it all in her native tongue before she died in 1884, when she left the home of her aunt in the House of Windsor.|0
Like the previous two 'Mad Max' films, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. I got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. I did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film.|1
Firstly , I am a huge fan of crap films . B grade is always good for a laugh . I like to watch them and like it because it was good for me . But I have watched B grade for the last couple years but never seen a crap film like the one below. When I watched it I thought it was funny, but I never got the enjoyment from it. But that's my opinion, I have never had a bad experience, and I am just a sucker for the movies that I love .|0
I bought this DVD from Walmart for cheap , thinking it would be a typical , crap straight-to-video monster junkie of the days, but then I found out this is real, it’s supposed to be the best DVD I have ever bought! I have to say it looks really good, but when you look at the pictures you find something very odd about it, and I’ve bought a lot of other stuff. What do you think? The only problem is it doesn’t fit in the box but it doesn’t look the same.|0
What is this ! ! its so bad . The animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 , how can anyone find that ? Also, I really like this. It’s so realistic! A lot of the other videos that I tried to do a few years ago were actually pretty good. I think I’ve done so much for the past couple of years that I feel like I’ve finally gotten back to the “real world” again! In other words, I feel really good that I have finally gotten back to this, and I’ll never stop playing.|0
It's not fair. I was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. I mean, I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, Airplane and the Naked Gun. However, After seeing Superhero movie, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes.|1
"I unwittingly walked into this `` trap '' of a movie.If I could turn back time or simply get a sense of what the movie was doing, I would feel a sense of relief and wonder. I knew what he was thinking. ""I'm going to do this."" What did the movie actually say to him? Was he just thinking: ''How do I find a new girlfriend?''? And if it was that way, why do they have to tell him to take his clothes off? And how do they tell him not to wear his clothes and not to wear his underwear?"|0
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne , the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school . Daphne 's sister, Erika, also plays the seductress, Daphne's cousin, Daphne's grandmother . They both play a very naughty role for the kids. Daphne has a high school in New York (NYC) and works as a waitress for a big-city restaurant in New Jersey. They both play music together in the same band that Daphne is playing with at school and Daphne's parents are both a fan of it, so it is the kind of thing the girls play together.|0
Think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to let the door open for a part 2. Let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser. I'd suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' kicked ass and I only watched that show to please my girlfriend!!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday when you've got nothing better to do. Or better yet download it so you don't waste your money.|1
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie 's not even over yet . In fact , I would have to wait until now . This is the first installment of the 's trilogy. It was originally published on DVD in 2009. It is now available for purchase. 's second film in the trilogy, 's fourth, 's third and fifth films, 's fourth film 's sequel 's fifth and the fourth film ''s sixth. This is also the third film from this trilogy in this list. I will not discuss it here.|0
This is one of the movies having made significant influence on me as a person. The sound tracks are best and the performance is excellent.

"""THE KING OF QUEENS,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it very much. For that reason, it's hard for me to say which episode is my favorite. Even so, I must say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong."|1
A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler(taylan brothers) had made their first shots on a tv-show a couple of years ago, as far as i know. That was kind of a Turkish X-Files, they had very nice stories but lacked on visual effects. This time it seems they had what they needed and used them well. This movie will make you laugh that's for sure, and as well it might have you scared. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it.|1
First , and foremost , I take issue to the title of this movie . 'Chupacabra ' is not a character in any movie that has been made for children. The character is, however, a character in several films, and has appeared in more of them , which I think is an indicator of his status as a character in the movie . There are many references to Chupacabra in the movie . I take issue with a few of these references. I think it would be better to look at the movie for the context . The main reference to Chupacabra in the movie is , or was .|0
Imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can . Add more plot holes than plot . Have it your way . This is the movie I’ll be watching for you next time I watch it . I just wanted to introduce my favorite characters and the main one, I guess . And now I am going to show you what I’ll be going to in the next week (at least) , I am going to be watching it . Here’s what my favorite characters are saying to each other. A few of my favorite characters are here .|0
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful ; it was pointless and just plain stupid . the thing that I like about the movie is that it gets a great deal more of a feel than a plotline . the dialogue is well done and the visuals are amazing. For example the guy in the movie (sadly, not the character) has some issues in his relationship with a girl from a previous relationship. The problem with this girl is that her boyfriend has just got a new boyfriend, while he has an old boyfriend.|0
"This episode sucks.Over the past few years I have watched all episodes of ""Next Generation"" and ""Voyager"" and am now watching ""Enterprise"".I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Until this episode. I stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. It is more like an attempt at slapstick.It does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping. It does little to build the series.Why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me. Was it the writing? Was it the directing?"|1
This movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life ! i waste my time looking for the best thing to watch on an iPhone or Android phone but the best thing i will ever do in my life is have my phone running iOS (or Android). Why did you think i should watch this on an iPhone with iOS (or Android)? I am a bit sad about this but if you watch the movie it will make you feel bad but at the moment i have not really been a part of this.|0
"""Catchfire"" or ""Backtrack"" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. That is, it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at this point. Why did she agree to do this? I don't know.The hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life.Worst of all, this film features a scene where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle) which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open."|1
"I , being a fan of Rupert Grint , rented this film a few months ago . I thought it was fantastic! LOL

The movie is the first time it ever aired. I couldn't find anything for you to go to. This is a film that seems to be made in a few years. I'm not sure if that's good or not but there are a lot of issues with it. I don't have a copy of the script though and I'm afraid it might not be the last one."|0
"This is absolute drivel, designed to shock and titillate the 60's mindset. The acting is completely wooden, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of, repetitively. The end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care. The one exception to this is the lead character ""Joe"" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor (either stoned, or the only one in the piece who can act!)"|1
"Can you people please stop believing everything this man says. Getyour facts straight before you start praising this liar. He's not evenfrom Flint. He just says that to keep his ""blue collar"" look. He's from a rich suburb next to Flint. I mean he went to a private school.His parents paid for him to go to school. Wow, that sure does seemlike they suffered a lot from Flint going to the dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he would just move there."|1
"Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this ""film"", I was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. It's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. I honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. The film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. I normally don't have a problem with SOV movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. And where did they find these ""actresses""?"|1
I thought I was going to see a UFO movie . Instead , I saw a movie that was trying to scare me about UFOs. I saw a UFO movie when it was coming into the country, and I saw something that didn't make sense. I saw this movie as a kid. When I read this article, I immediately noticed that I didn't want to see a movie when I first heard about it. But I didn't. I didn't even go to see the movie. What I noticed is that I don't see the UFO movie when I first heard about it.|0
A group of four young men , attending a prestigious private school , belong to an old covenant that was once a part of the Church. After the death of James II in 1089, their new-found relationship was put to use, but before they can be called to serve, there must be another man who can take their place. This is one of their most famous works. It shows the nature of the covenant of marriage, and the love of a man for his family . It also shows how the covenant should be kept.|0
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and it’s a perfect shot to shoot the main character who is on the bottom, so it would be a perfect scene for that. When I say perfect I mean perfect. I don’t think that was true of this. I was in the audience, and this is where I think it should have been. It was the best movie I’ve ever seen because I watched it on television.|0
The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series . Well defined characters , tight scripts , varied and interesting characters . And, of course , there is no such thing in the world. But, there are many characters that are a lot to like in every single episode . So, if you like the show , I can recommend the cast as well . As I’m sure you can, I would definitely recommend the cast too . So, let’s have a look at the cast . What do you like best about the show?|0
"This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. A friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. Ehh... Where to start? The writing, the acting, the quality? All of it, sucked. Quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. The dialog was worse than I thought it could ever be in the movies. Blatant dialog, such as ""how ya doing?""..."|1

But it would be more interesting to look at what's really happening on television than at radio or at other media outlets. As one journalist said to me on a recent visit to Los Angeles: ""I don’t see a TV or a radio talk show. You can't watch anything on radio or TV, and I don’t see it on radio or on radio."""|0
"11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb. There is a reason for this utter lack of interest in Across the Moon. It is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. See this film for examples of terrible production in all respects. The opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. The ending features Michael McKean staring out a prison window saying ""There's lots of mysteries out there."" followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield."|1
Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years . It struck home . For those of us who tried this method , if we have no hair left , but we have a beard , the beard has become too big , and it makes it hard for the beard to hold itself together . It has become too tough for it to hold itself together , and makes it too tough for hair to hang itself together , making it impossible for it to maintain itself . The way the beard and the hair break apart . It is very hard on it to hold any strength .|0
"Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial, I had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue. The actors need to be charged as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye.This production offers the disclaimer, ""For dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts"", or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a Bible story which needed no drama added."|1
Tumbling Doll of Flesh ( aka Niku daruma and Psycho : The Snuff Reels ) This was on my want list for a Halloween party in March. After that, I started to wonder what this was about. If you want to join Niku and you can’t make it to any of my photos, I highly encourage you to follow along with me, and I’ll share some of my stuff in the comments. So far, so good. If you need help finding your own photos or if you want to see the rest of my photos at the end of this post, feel free.|0
I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career , but `` The Man of the Books'' was more of a movie than a book. This weekend, the screen adaptation of ``The Man of the Books'' is being filmed in London and is due to open in New York City at some point. In the meantime, watch for a look at the book itself. Here's to hoping that you catch on. For all your fans of the movie, this is a fun movie that you're all very excited for!|0
Because I would have never ever seen this movie through to the end . Although there are some , but no doubt a lot of reasons , I think that I will never know what it might be . . . . I only have to listen a few times, and it will be one of those movies , . . . . So I've seen this movie through to the close of the end, but I think it's probably worth a try. I really do think that you should probably read up on the movie in the first place, so that you understand the concept well enough.|0
"`` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL . A computer scientist uses HAL as a programmer, to help him to solve a set of computer problems. With HAL, a computer scientist can make some of his own computers to work with to solve the problems he's solved in his head. HAL then uses his brain to solve the problems presented by the computer. The main character's brain is used to create a new computer. 2. HAL and his computers
Halo was very popular on television as it was widely used on many other shows from the 1980s and 90s."|0
This is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The story is classic, some high-school students tries a prank on the class' asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time, not good if a movie tries to be scary. The actors are quite ok and the girls are cute (after all, they're asian) so i'll give it two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.|1
I've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom, possibly because I was already tired as it was late at night. The second effort I managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again I found myself asleep. I can go on and on like this but I think you're getting the point......nothing happens ever in this movie.|1
`` The Quickie '' tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and ... well , frankly , it was a ... of Malibu . However , for a ... well , it is not just a family ... the ... people in Malibu . This family, in addition, ... is an Italian ... in Malibu . And so ... there are no Russians in Malibu . (4) No Russian children, no Russians in Malibu. There is no Russian child, no children at home. No Russian children, no ... in Malibu, no Russian kids.|0
There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short, I just had to take a couple of moments to leave it alone for a few hours. I didn’t know much about what I was trying to say until I read your post and was really happy with what I had said. So here you go – I don’t think it was that much of a compliment, but I wanted to point out some of the flaws that this film faced. I am sure the film did a good job with a few twists and turns of story.|0
I won't waste your time by describing the plot for this, the other reviewer already did this quite well. I will however give you my opinion of this movie. This movie is basically anti japanese propoganda. The japanese are portrayed as incredably evil b**tards who have respect for nothing, as well as having very poor martial arts skills (groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion.) The fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every (if not every) fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense.|1
"Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics , which is one reason you should never watch them. So I decided to share with you our first movie that makes you laugh, cry and scream. “It was so funny, it was so sweet”

“I just love it, it is so funny. I love it” “I love it, it is so funny, I love it”

“I didn’t really get it at all. I know it was great, it is amazing."|0
Seriously ! You 've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it . It is no surprise that there was so much damage to the trailer. The movie is about two men and it has a lot of holes to it that you'd expect, in order to get a shot. The only thing missing from this movie is it's voice acting, which is something that most movies don't have. The music is really well done and it's very well done and that makes it pretty funny.|0
There's a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story's purpose was, or just didn't care. All of the hallmarks of your average family film are present- rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. The movie has very little in common with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic Gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time.|1
I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.This film written & directed by Scott Caan & starring David Byrne is a good movie, and it’s a good film, but it is a bad movie, and it should not be called a movie.I’ve been looking for an English/English-language film director/producer to produce this movie, and it seems that there are some bad reviews there, so we have to look at how we think of it, to make sure the reviews are what they are. We need a different name, though.|0
I will never , ever forget watching this show around the age of 13 . Even at the young age of 13 , he didn’t believe that he could do something in the same way. But now he has a friend and he has the right to tell him what he means. You are going to believe that you will never, ever again forget that you have watched this show and that you have seen all the stories that were given to you in the movies and books that were shown. It will never, ever be true. So let’s make this possible.|0
"This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work, whose writing is amazing. Sadly, this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation Wharton's work depicts. Ward and Dalton aren't so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me wince. She was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole movie long, and I never believed a word out of her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward ""Why can't I move you?"""|1
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it . . . and I am not one of the few who would want to watch it again when it was a big one. So here is the full review. I like what you are seeing. There is only one character that I like in that movie, and that’s a woman that is in her 20th year. That is not a bad thing and I have not seen many of these movies over the last 30 years.|0
For connoisseurs of bad movies, Galaxina is a true gem. With truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes involving the Harley Davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.Sadly, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, I suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.Bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!|1
The girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. What I'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. The delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. Lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. And if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: They are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana mansion.|1
"I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest, this is a great film.Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish ""Origin of Species"". Their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve.Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and excellent job of bringing Randal Keynes' biography to life."|1
This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting . Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a luxury apartment in London. This is a remake of The Three Stooges and it features many scenes from the same set. There are scenes from the final episodes of Star Wars: Battlefront 2, but we won't get into that yet. Instead we'll get in to see what's coming on board, and hopefully, the series will get what it deserves for being the biggest and most popular of the Star Wars franchise (and perhaps even the best).|0
this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen . this is slow , plot less and i dont like the characters. but it has a very cool ending . so if you really want to know why this is the worst movie you could do about it but i dont really care. but i was wondering what the reason is. because i know you guys dont really care about it because you dont actually like the ending. so i am sorry to have to tell you again , you can see why i think you do.|0
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast , Ice-cream , I Scream is one of the most watched Turkish films. It's one of the best films I've ever seen and I love to watch and love to read. The story follows the adventures of a young student in Istanbul who is introduced to the world of video games in the hopes of creating an unforgettable film. While watching Ice-cream I Scream, I always get a feeling that this film is one of the best. This movie is very good, and this is a very good film.|0
"This movie was lacking in a lot of areas. It's about this Elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these BIKERS from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is named Banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. THey want the Elvis guy to be their ""driver"". At times, I wanted the folks from MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good. Sure, there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines, such as ""What kind of beer do you want? A COLD ONE"". That was cheesy."|1
This movie certainly is a weird one to say the least . The basic plot is 3 old business associates from a couple of years ago. They meet at a club. The old man walks out with the old man and some old business associates. They are in and out of the business and they don't know the other 2. A few years back I was talking to a friend, and he said that they had no business in the city because they wanted to stay put and have some sort of business to do. Well, now they want to stay, and they're very excited.|0
"...now please move on because that's getting on my nerves.Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like ""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""To Die For"" (and others not so brilliant movies, i.e. the unnecessary ""Psycho"" remake) started an experimental phase with ""Gerry"", which reached its peak with the thought-provoking ""Elephant"". ""Last Days"" had some interesting aspects but was very uneven, while ""Paranoid Park"", his new film, also has good-looking 15 year-olds walking around... and not much else."|1
"Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company, but when the owner has to sell for health reasons, she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman (Robert Ames) as the ""front"" even though she is the brains.Of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary, basically still running everything and teaching him class. She loves the dope, but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of bimbos."|1
This thing, directed by french sensation Patrick Sebastien,is worst than all the turkeys that you may have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, The patriot, etc... you get the picture, this one's the pits. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in france, (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is his first movie let's hope it's the last. I hope Troma or someone would distribute this film in the States, so that you guys out there can excperience the French stench at it's worst.|1
This is a poor, poor movie. Full of clichés, unrealistic moments: punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out, never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions! !, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first, walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships, the very dodgy, cheesy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment!!|1
Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.It is indeed your property to do with as you wish.|1
Like a lot of films from the early sounds days , Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than any other single film (even if the films were all a bit different ). In the cinema there was a very long tradition of making some good movies in the early 2000s , and it is certainly true there is a long tradition going on in modern cinema, but that is just the way cinema has grown up. This trend can be seen in every major British film (even when it is still a film) , although they are all somewhat dated and may be a bit dated by now.|0
Jack Higgins ' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into `` one last job '' ( where have we read that last sentence?! ? ! ? I think so :-). And I think you can say that I don't think you can be sure of a story you have read all the way back when. For some reason I think you need to be more certain of this. A lot of things have happened so far that I think you know how it has gone in that direction. And so what we can do is to find a way to make it seem so.|0
Got to confess right up front that I did n't watch this entire movie . I missed the first hour of the movie. It was the biggest movie ever and it made my heart jump with delight when I saw it! I am still sad to admit that this was a great movie I had been waiting for since it was first released. I am sad that the film is cancelled. I am sad to admit that I had no idea what was going to happen in the next hour. I had been waiting for this movie for over two years.|0
It's 1913. A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops, his dream comes true. Being completely absorbed in his film-making, however, he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man. Several over-budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego.|1
A bit `` the movie in the movie '' case , or as the theme is virtual game here , or it's the actual `` the movie in the movie that's going to happen in the movie , or it's the movie that doesn't seem to be doing it ''' , or it's the movie that is being played out in the movie , and the movie in the movie has a `` `` , that '''' movie, or a '''' movie, or a '''' movie, or '' '' , that movie'' which '''' comes out.|0
I'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the movie creators, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. But really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story. Aggravatingly, there were many unrelated side-stories that could have been edited out.In relating the events leading up to the mass-murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary. Was it political? Philosophical? Revenge?|1
What on earth happened to RGV ? There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to be very careful and not let anything that happens on screen really mess up your movie. How could RGV be any kind of a good movie? I have watched so many movies and thought, “How did we get here?” But it doesn’t matter much if you are watching the “What on earth were you talking about” movie, it is just not as good as the good movies that come out every other week.|0
"This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out ""Undisputed 2"". Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched ""The Shepherd"", I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen."|1
There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was... well, just awful.Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.Why, why, why Mike Myers?? The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic isn't going to spy this film.|1
This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites . Castle Hill was a very enjoyable movie but when it ended, we thought it was over, it was over . But, the most interesting part in this story is how many people are watching it and what makes the story stand out, it doesn’t always make the film look like it was over. It is a good movie. There are many good ones, and it’s no surprise there are lots of great ones. But I found that it did have some faults.|0
"The story line of a man 's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the edge of tears."" ""What do I do now?"" ""I do everything I can find."" ""I do everything I can!"" ""Do you know what this is?"" ""I'm the mother."" ""It's a book you read."" ""A book I read for a child's first day at school."" ""And a book my son was born with."" ""But I don't know how to do it."""|0
"Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of ANY sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour? Is there even just a single genuinely FUNNY parody film anymore? All I see are zero-quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they're not clever, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every conceivable way.The Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself ""Sports Movie"". It's the same thing, though."|1
"Well, I have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said ""leave it alone."" Why they had to make this re-make of the 1960 ""Psycho,"" I don't know. My guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern-day actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. The dialog was the same and the story the same.On one hand, I applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film."|1
Loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the characters. I really really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored. This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie! Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound. Not bad sound but would have liked to have more. Great blood splatters. Great murder weapons. Great costumes!|1
"Let 's get things straight . I was raised Catholic , and in a very religious family , and spent a great deal of time in a Christian family . At the end of that time , I became a Protestant . I have always said to myself, "" If you are Catholic and have been baptized in a Christian household, you mustn't be a Protestant"". I have not, and I believe I do, a Protestant. That is why I do not want anyone to go to the altar of a Protestant church. I am not an atheist nor an atheist- that is why I do not pray."|0
"Big spoiler right here: this film is B!A!D! But enjoy, it's good bad.Bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience. Since it's a Troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.Most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. The brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, ""%@#$!"|1
It 's about jealousy , it 's about racism , it 's about manipulation , but the underlying message is very strong, and there's no evidence to suggest that it 's about that , for example, if you 're like, 'n't a lot of people , you 'm going to get away with it and you will get more and more out of it. That said, I think the message is pretty clear. I don 't have any evidence that 's about that. I think it 's more than just being ignorant of things.|0
The director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns . Have a great day . . . and a great idea. We'll talk more about her and how she managed to get here, and where we are in the future. You can see the trailer of the new trailer for the book by the publisher here. Maddie is writing a novel for her new company, which, according to our partners on Amazon, will begin selling on May 1, 2020.

"I watched 40 minutes and couldn't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to some light reading ""Lobotomy for Beginners"".It was hard to say what aspect of this production was most displeasing - dialogue made up entirely of sound-bytes or the acting by numbers.It was difficult to determine the period in which the drama was supposed to take place. There were throw-away references to Lord Nelson and slavery but Edmund, the cleric-to-be, played by Blake Ritson was the only actor who one could believe inhabited the early 19th century."|1
If you 're looking for an accurate portrayal of Che Guevara , the Cuban revolutionary who helped aid Fidel Castro, you would find it at a very interesting book, The Little War of Castro. I have been reading the book extensively, but I thought it a bit boring to begin with. It was a good portrayal of Cuba, in my opinion. The book is a little dated, and I think I should have written it sooner, or more accurately, than I do, but I would give it a better chance of being read later. I wish you the best, Che!|0
"It 's really good to see Van Damme 's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to what they were getting in 2012 and the way the film has been made. He 's actually very excited that we can see how he is working now as well as in 2013. I am so glad we can see that and we hope we will have more of that in 2012 when it looks like that is how he will be going to be going to a film. We're hoping to get good results this summer."""|0
"Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him. When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity. However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change .... This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it."|1
Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.It 's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the effects of stress on the hypothalamus. In her late teens, she is the kind of girl she is, and there is nothing the hypothalamus can do for her, but a lot of what she experiences in her early 20s, and especially when she's in shock and she's still in shock, doesn't seem like it could be true for her.It could be a brain cancer.It may be that all of the symptoms are caused by the chemicals in the air.|0
"Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notices their garbage is gone again....there must be someone stealing it from the curb. He goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck. When he finally gets to the dump, he is startled to learn not only that ""other folks garbage"" has been stolen, too, but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill."|1
"This movie is bad , so bad that my mother who can barely stand the `` suspense '' of Disney movies was killed in an act of murder. At least I thought so. Why? We don’t know the answer to this question in any way. First, there are more people who think they don’t know the answer to this issue. Second, I believe there may be a better solution to this problem than the movie “suck it up.”

What I want to know is if there is a better solution, please let me know in comments."|0
I can't believe I even tried to watch this filth. As an avid B-Horror movie fan, I was more than riveted at the prospect of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, right from the opening of the film, I could not, for the life of me, think of a worse movie than this. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of.|1
I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. It tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system, but it doesn't even present a positive solution. I guess I didn't feel really for the kids. I totally can understand what their gripes were and I know how poor the state of schools are, but I found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey. If this comes on TV, don't waste your time. Watch Short Circuit again for the 235th time.|1
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad guy? So what are you waiting for? It’s like, you’re going to get in this situation. You’re not happy with yourself. You’re not ready. But in this situation, you really want to be the guy who doesn’t give a fuck. And maybe that’s the only way you will get the best performance possible with your dick. You can’t live with the “you”.|0

"Deep Water (2006) ****""It is indifferent... it's there waiting for you to make one slip up."" Those words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean I have ever heard muttered. Its furies are boundless, not least of which, her loneliness. Those words come from the mesmerizing and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. It is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who partook in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the World. If you do not know his story, it may be best to stop reading now."|1
New rule . Nobody is allowed to make any more Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original story. So if you make a zombie movie and you don't have any original story to play around with it, then you're not allowed to make a Zombie movie. Now I have a question. If you're making zombie movies, why should they be allowed to make zombie movies? Is there an exception to this rule that you're only allowed to make a zombie movie? Or, is that all you've been saying?|0
Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist, helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best, but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy. The first story is a ham-fisted, meaningless trudge with a B-movie sci-fi premise. The second achieves some poignancy, but only via the outrage-inducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character. The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The direction is consistently clueless - all whirling sound and fury, a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment; suffocating in an ill-chosen music score and in indifferently flashy acting.|1
"The Love Letter ( 1999 ) : Starring Kate Capshaw , Tom Everett Scott , Tom Selleck , Ellen DeGeneres , Jonny Baum , Sarah Jane Birkert

In a scene where Kate is playing Tom Everett Scott / Kate Capshaw in the role of her father, she is shown saying: “Do I need to go home now?” she says, and then begins to look at the camera, wondering: “What are they doing with my face?” she asks the camera man, and then asks Kate to say what she wants to do."|0
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The Church of God. Well, I think I should have made that movie, but I didn't really like the script or the characters or what the plot was. That's pretty much what I expected from the script. What I don't quite understand, and maybe I'm just not seeing it. I thought that it had been a little short film but that is how it is, the movie looks and it feels.|0
^^contains spoilers^^This movie is utter crap. Do not watch.There is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.The acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. No one can even cry believably.If you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.For example, I left the room for a second, while Jennie Garth's character was sleeping with her manager.|1
I can't believe I sat through this garbage. Palm trees in D.C. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit so obviously artificial that I thought it was SUPPOSED to be a dummy ... until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. Don't waste your time - I wish I hadn't. The only saving grace is that it was on cable, so I didn't waste my money on top of everything.|1
As cute and adorable as they are , the story of three singing chipmunks just does n't seem to have much of a connection to the rest of the world. At first, though, it's not clear how he got there; he was in the mountains, walking in a snowman's pack. That's when a group of kids decided they needed to join him for a trip on a sled. They did it and took off for the first time. He was just about to step on the gas when the snow started flying. The kids quickly realized that the car was in flames.|0
Harlan Banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. However, he decides to take one last routine job in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple.

I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the sequels begin to go downhill. I believe that this is not the case(at least not for this film). This movie is even better than the first film! The original crew returns three years after they successfully robbed Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each one of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do that, they must do a couple heists in Europe to get the money.The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations.|1
I tried to give this show a chance , but it really does n't sit well with me . Although it's really fun to look at and think of how it all works, it seems to do very well . If I were to put all my thoughts into it and come up with a better way, I would suggest that I find a way to get it up, instead of throwing in my own head. It's hard to keep up with a TV show when you don't understand it, especially when it's so new and interesting to watch.|0
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories? You'd think so by some of the reviews. Al Adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go into them knowing that already it helps, and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value, especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First off, this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits, so you know things are looking promising.|1
"Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones , I wondered once again , why remake a good movie ? This time I decided I had to make a remake of this original movie instead of the main remake of the original movie :D

I have a big problem with this movie. I am really afraid that I will not be getting a good picture from it when I do it. I think we will be able to put it in another movie. As for the movie , its really good when you find out that I did it because you have to go and do it ."|0
"A stupid movie, with a stupid plot. Feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender. I especially ""Liked"" the part, where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water. Because we all know how dedicated America is to conservation of the environment. Kyoto, anyone?? And the french chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger... This is why people think Americans have no culture. That, and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to Europe to ""see the world"" (i.e."|1
'The Dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit), it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.As 'Sir', the overbearing actor and main focus of the play, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow, winds ...' bit of 'King Lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager, Madge (Eileen Atkins, good as ever) about the old times.|1
New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow drivers in order to score some quick cash. The problem is that they really don't have much of a plan and when complications arise things turn deadly.Fast moving popcorn action film has a great deal going with it. First off the film is under 90 minutes so the film doesn't really have the time to bog down in plot. It cranks everything up and just goes. Next the film has some great action sequences so one moves towards the edge of ones seat.|1
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy . It 's hardly a comedy , but it has been around for over 15 years now. Good Humor Man will be available for $20 at Best Buy. If you don't see it, just wait until you want to buy it as well, then it will be just $5. If you like the film but like the reviews, then you should probably buy it for $20. That's $2.5 if you're lucky enough to buy it for $10, and it can be bought at Best Buy.|0
When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I wasn't expecting a show with complex characters, intriguing plot lines, and impeccable writing... but that's exactly what I got.Greek follows several college students who are in the Greek system at Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright enters Cyprus Rhodes as a Polymer Science major who aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the show's center and soon-to-be-president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious sorority on campus), isn't exactly supportive of his plans.|1
I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies. This movie just did not move me. I felt like it was about one hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. If you like tragedies, you MIGHT like this. I just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie.|1
Norris plays a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to, well, create Armegeddon. He eventually kills the creature by, get this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So is the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) kid is there ostensibly to humanize CN. OK. Doesn't work, makes no sense, and advances the plot, so-called, not one bit.|1

What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year ) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had several awards lavished on it undeservedlyFirst off is the script . When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow .|1
"There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if I hadn't actually started watching it.To begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. Since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out ""Look there!"""|1
It is terrible! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. Even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. The story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. I don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. The acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful.|1
"Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice of director in case you're looking for undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle ""adventure"". Let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot (and underage) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It's actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco!"|1
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films . I am looking for all his films to start at the end of 2015, even if I have only a handful of them at the moment . I also hope that he is able to work on all of his sequels . I would like to know how they are going to work out for him so that he gets a lot of film time , I am not sure what I would be aiming for, I hope that this would be the same for everyone .|0
"Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie--who woulda thought? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed--""Wisdom"" (with then girlfriend Demi Moore) and ""Men at Work"" (with brother Charlie Sheen). They are lousy films---badly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor but lousy as a director. I turned this on in pure curiousity--it has a great cast and I had nothing else to do. Damned if it didn't pull me in.It concerns Estevez coming home from Vietnam permanently scarred by what happened over there."|1
The Toxic Avenger , Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger ( John Altamura who is the only other Avenger in America) , the most powerful Avenger in the world , comes to the rescue of an evil group of villains. The only one who can prevent this, is Captain America . This was not just a theory, this is a human theory. All of these theories, all of the other theories on the Avengers, are true. And this is a truth. I think that the fact of the Avengers, is a very important thing in this book.|0
OK , well , no one in their right mind ( s ) would pick up a movie titled ``Guns of a Gun,'' which would have been banned as a hate movie. I'm pretty sure I don't know why I'd want such an item, since I'm fairly sure it's not a hate movie either... but I don't think anyone would be interested in buying one. Also, it's a great movie because it's going to be interesting. The first thing I'll do if I find a movie like that, that I don't know anything about...|0
Get the CD instead . The show is tame , and the editing sucks . The crowd gets way too much, too much . The only way that can help is to have a good time with this. The music is nice and the editing doesn't seem to do it justice but the music is interesting and it's the only album you'll be able to enjoy on a show . The editing sucks but the music makes it feel less boring and less awkward . The music makes it feel more casual and it's a good way to keep the audience away from watching a live show.|0
The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting it in the Old West. Except it's not the real Old West, of course. It's some sort of Future West, in a world where some apocalypse has, as apocalypses are known to do, killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies. It's zombie virus time again, folks, and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them.So, into this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. He's a bounty-hunter, getting paid for taking care of zombies.|1
Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead . I suppose only institutionalized writers and comedians need to be reminded to take advantage of all this, but as I’m sure you already have been, this was just one of a few that were put into place in the last 10 years . I may have made this up because it’s an interesting read. The funny part is that he’s done so many things, he’s given so many different things, he gets so much pleasure in having done so much, it’s hilarious .|0
"Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load. It has humour (""You're just making it up as you go along!"" ""Yup, but I do it brilliantly""), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of ""get on with it""."|1
I'd liked the Takashi Miike films I'd seen so far, but I found this pretty disappointing. I'd bought it, but I won't be keeping it.I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has just two episodes. In the first, a killer abducts women, cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin, and plants a flower in the brain. You can tell that from the DVD box. In the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred out by TV static.|1
Steven Segal has done some awful films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good.The plot is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is being executed because he stole some money? Some Mercenary types kidnap a Supreme Court Justice? Their goal is to exchange the Judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money?|1
I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldn't put down while reading.The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.|1
hello all Denver fans!i couldn't agree more with you guys! This show was so cool and cute, i i watched it as a kid in the late 80s. Among Denver are other favourite too, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I am 24 now, but it is still one of my favourite shows, and my favourite cartoon from the 80s. It brings back all the memories. The theme tune was great too, i get goosebumps whenever i hear it. It is sad that it lasted such a short time, but it has remained a firm favourite.|1
Jon Cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in Two and a Half Men , which he perfected in The Hunger Games – his first movie. In this film, Cryer was a guy in need of solving a puzzle or two. The two men shared a lot of secrets in one of the few real-life scenarios that Cryer had worked out. Cryer is also a member of the team, but he doesn’t appear on the team’s official roster. In the film’s first action scene, he jumps off a building, falls in love, and gets married.|0
"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake . The DVD version titled `` The One-Armed One-Bare-Boom,'' which you can find here. There's nothing else here, so if you're a subscriber to Netflix and not a regular subscriber, I encourage you to go ahead and click on the ""Find New subscribers"" link, and you'll see a screen with the Netflix version available to you. The original DVD is now available for free to the general public to watch or download, which is great!"|0
I really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a new life and he's just like, 'Oh, I don't think I'm going to be here forever.' That was all we got to go on! It's interesting that a good doctor should be able to change his mind, even if it's only to a few months, but if you've ever seen a really bad doctor, you might remember this. He'll be fine, if you like that.|0
"This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen , right from the start the movie goes straight down the middle

The first two scenes are very good. The last line is the last scene that I heard. I think the rest is okay and I like it a lot. It is funny, I just like this movie. I have not watched this movie until last time and it is one I have never seen again . I know how it feels when you leave the cinema and not show it. I watched it because I loved the first part so I loved watching this movie."|0

I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal movie because my parents thought they were having a great time and they didn’t want to be the first one in their class. A few years ago I met a wonderful guy. He was a guy with whom I had a great friendship before we started dating. This was a very nice guy and I could see that we were dating and that we would not be too far apart from each other. I don’t believe in love until I have been in relationship for a very long time.|0

The father in the middle is in charge of the wife and the daughter in the daughter's family. He wants the daughter and the other children to live with the mother and the older child. The old man is being held captive in his own brother, who is the main man in the country. The husband is the man in the head and is being held in slavery.|0
This is a crummy film, a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies. And a genre that has been done so much better before. The plot limps along, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) The characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable. Matt Dillon, a fine, intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialog is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. I wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list.|1
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it 's best . This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is one of the best productions I’ve seen of all time and as I’m writing it, I must take a lot of good pictures. The production team is excellent, and we’d love the opportunity to work on it together and have a big project planned. This time around, you might not want to work on it, and I’ve heard a few people say you want to do it. Some said, “What do you want to do?|0
Incredibly , `` Vampire Assassin '' is significantly worse than such atrocities as `` Tequila Body Shots '' and `` the blood-spattered face of the Vampire Club '' that you never forget. I think it is more than a bit embarrassing to read the comments in these articles. For a while, I had asked the same question I ask myself often: Why are you writing this article again? And how much is it worth for a writer to pay you for their time to write about a topic. If you write a very good piece, the price will go down the drain.|0
"With great expectations I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar-race this year. Part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. It fails in delivering the ""message"" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. There are some so extreme misfires I haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense)."|1
I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and was also working at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston, during Allison. First the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a daytime population density similar to Wall Street!! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest Children's Hospital before it doubled in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is bigger than that of Memphis.|1
"This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me . Everything I hate about films is that they are terrible. And I hate that you can make a movie to be annoying. I am in the habit of having one and it is very frustrating to watch. However, this is my favorite movie so far:

If this sounds like you, I hope you liked it. I love this movie so much I can’t even begin to tell you how glad I am to see you. I am not an actor but I think I really liked the movie a lot as a kid."|0
There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak.|1
The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief(the Indian) by an Winnipeg city officer(the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada, a small scale Martin Luther King thing. The misjustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple in the Canadian cinema diet. What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice.|1
I thought this movie was perfect for little girls . It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all the girls get married, and then they marry and they get a small fortune, which makes for a really cool little girl. It was so real and I had to laugh a little bit. I also thought that was the most wonderful movie I've ever seen. How I missed it is because I didn't know what I was expecting to see in it before. I really do like the cinematography and I loved the set-up but it seemed to be the most fun of the lot.|0

This review contains spoilers.I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. After searching the website for this review, it was not possible to locate the movie on Amazon.com. This review can be found here.If you have any other horror movie reviews, please feel free to drop them down below. What did I like about the cast? The new cast is a big deal. There’s a great story line, with many characters that have had to adapt to new characters. I was really surprised by this casting.|0
"A bad Quentin Tarantino rip off, at least I hope that's what they were going for because at least then I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. One scene a ""singing"" scene with Rose McGowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. So besides his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene this film sucked. Some of the crappiest dialogue I have ever heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been."|1
WARNING!!! SOME POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS, AS IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE!! !Okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, I am going to give it to you. Two couples head out to a camping site, but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem.Now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.1. Never, ever go to camp dubbed Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Don't have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. Don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away.|1
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen. On a par with Blair Witch and just as annoying. The flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and I think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. I think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out. Then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something.|1
Anne ( Natalie Portman ) tells us about how much she hates her mother , Adele ( Susane Sarandon ) . She says that she loves Adele, but has never had any sex with her, since she wasn’t even born until she was 5 months pregnant. She’s now 2 years old, so she has no idea what she’s doing. She said she doesn’t want anyone to hear it. So she tells Adele that she has wanted to take a picture for them. “Adele is going to get married before she can have kids,” she told us.|0
This movie was Flippin Awful .... I wanted those hours of my life back . For god 's sake , I am so glad to meet you. You know what i was like back in the early 90s. I would have walked away from the movie a day or so ago if I could have seen you again for a few days. I didn't. Now that you've seen the movie, it was amazing. I had a lot of fond memories of having had my family there for the last 30 years or so in my life. But you don't.|0
For a series that was inspired by Kolchak, it's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful Hans Keller - I've often wondered if I'm missing the point. The story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it.|1
First, what is really great about this movie: - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them. He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters. - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. - The idea of a nine lost in his own world, incapable of leaving. Still, I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: - Horrible second part. It seems that the director was very eager to make something new, but despite of the efforts it was really boring - Very annoying character Melissa.|1
Here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism, & bravery. Plus, it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and Alyssa Milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome, confident, no-nonsense Fizzy...a great role-model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the storyline excellent, but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed.|1

Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor.|1
WARNING: PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste. Fans of his earlier films will probably like `eXistenZ', but it definitely isn't one for the squeamish. All of the usual elements are here. A game pod made out of skin (hooked into your back), buckets of blood, a gun made out of bones, and a manic mechanic to name but a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts, and just plain weird in others. But one thing the film has is undeniable originality.|1
First of all I hate those moronic rappers , who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their head or body. But then, you've got two bullets to your head. They're getting a kick out of each other. And if they hit each other in the head. I mean, if you were to shoot me and kill me right now and I'm going to kill myself, I don't want you to be dead. If you want to be killed right now, you need a gun to your head if you wanna kill.|0
"Firstly , this is NOT an adaptation of a Stephen King book , short story , novella , or anything else

When I looked at the article for a third time on how to fix this problem:

It looks like this:

a) When I first started to use the term, “new” to refer to a book, I couldnt find a term that I liked that seemed to fit this category, so I made this

a) I wrote the title of this article and it was typed “new” to refer to a book. However, it does not look like that will be accurate."|0
When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake.|1
"I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it. So charming and so very romantic. David Duchovny and Ms. Driver have chemistry that is so hot, you will need to take off a layer of clothing. The supporting cast is 100% top notch. Just watching Caroll O'Connor and Robert Loggia play off one another is pure poetry. Bonnie Hunt and Jim Bellushi and a wonderful team and some of the films most charming moments are when they are on the screen. Like Jim Belushi screaming at his children to go to sleep ""FOREVER!"""|1
"Mixed group of ""experts"" (explorers, divers and scientists) venture a mile underground and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a spot even more remote, where they find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some big, razor-fanged, winged, computer generated creatures lurking about. The cave is sealed off by a rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing everyone off as they search for an exit. And that's all she wrote with this low-aiming effort that even fails to combine action, science fiction and horror on the most elementary of levels."|1
"Went to the Preview Engagement of `` Grand Champion '' today ( Dallas/Fort Worth , Austin , Snyder and a few other places)

On Monday, April 30, the WCCU will get a live stream of the 2016 Grand Champion Season 3 at 7PM EST in a live broadcast on the CBS-TV network. Each day's live feed will be streamed live locally on CBS Sports and online. This will be one of the first time this will happen for CBS and is an interesting time to have the WCCU live stream live. The live broadcast will be broadcasted on Sunday, April 31 at 7:00AM EST."|0
I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life , I can't really understand what it was like, but I have watched a lot of this so far , and the most enjoyable of the few. I was just watching it on DVD last night and thought it was quite cool. When I got up to the movie I saw it with all these great characters and characters. The most enjoyable part is when the main characters talk to me. I guess they are really great, I would say, in general they are good people.|0
"""Rouge"" is part of a trilogy, but very much stands on its own. It isn't a sequel of any sort. The very end, which I won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. This film amazes me because it is so spare, so subtle and simple, but is as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. Both themes are loosely woven together in the story."|1
Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even by the low standards of disaster movies, excuse me allow me to correct myself, even by the low standards of made for TV disaster movies this is truly awful. Where do I begin? The dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but I doubt it. Most dams, especially large ones that generate electricity have oh I don't know a power plant nearby, some sluice gates for water to run through, heck even a high tension electrical wire or two.|1
There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst . Saw is just that.The movie is very good . I mean it was great . All that is required to make a nice film is the proper balance of the film ,the lighting and sound ,the composition and design and all . If you look a bit further, you can find more details about how it was made . You cannot just take a look at this movie and you will see the best parts. In this video, I think you can easily see why this was the best thing about this film.|0
"The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics. While the theme seems common, what ""makes"" the movie is the unconventional way the story is told.The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of the lead, and his innocence lost. The politician is the prince of double-talk, a real snake.The camera work is impressive. It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue. Ditto for the music.The story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres. A very canny strategy by the writer/director."|1
"This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar. During a three hours drive from Madagascar, there is an explosion of smoke on the street, and the whole neighborhood is full of angry protesters. This is what they do. They call for police to step in. But they are all too afraid to move. ""I want the police to arrest all these people and I want them to go home."" So they say that they can get them home."|0
The greatest movie ever.How 's that for a contention ? However , if we look at it through purely cinematic means, it seems that the best movie in the world is about three people being murdered, the man and woman who are trying to rob you and then being kidnapped and murdered and being forced into submission. Who's there ? What are we waiting for ? We want the movie that's going to take you to a new planet, an old place, a new country, or a new world. Who's going to see the movie ?|0
I just saw this movie and all I can say is, where are the drive in's these days. This seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it does remind one of the era it was made in. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress.|1
"i ca n't even describe it . it 's the worst movie i 've ever seen ( i 'm being a huge fan of the movie) . I have to say that my husband is very disappointed that he got this movie :/

The fact is, they made it so much fun to have the characters from both the movies, rather than just the characters the movie is based on. And with that, it is pretty obvious how much money is being spent to keep the characters apart and still give the characters fun and memorable moments that are often overlooked or ignored in many movies."|0
Given the subject matter of drug addiction Down to the Bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film. But depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad. The film has some good things going for it, most notably the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction. But there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad. The film's failings lie mainly with the story, which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going.|1
I 'm sorry but I ca n't agree that this was a good movie . Yes , it looked good but if you see what I have seen so I will stop and let you know how I made it to you to know that it is better than what you have read . I havent been able to watch the movies , not sure what they do for the movie itself , but what you see is what I have seen. It looks good but if you have to see it . I can't believe I have missed a lot of time since the movie .|0
I watched 5 % of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole thing for myself so I will get the movie tonight. It was pretty cool as well. It’s probably my most favorite moment of the week. Thank you for visiting. Let me know when the next one will be out and about. You can catch up to us in the movie and see it over on our Facebook page. It’s a great summer of summer and I’m enjoying it so much. I hope you enjoyed the rest of the weekend.|0
This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested. It was really funny in one moment (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious in the next. Plus, it had Ellen in it and I've always had a soft spot for her.Basically, the owner of a book store, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store. She thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it.|1
Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in the middle of a cultural and spiritual upheaval. Billy Graham does a good job of portraying life in this sweet, sometimes corny, but all the way sincere flick. He gives us a look at not only the social scene but gives good, solid advice that holds true today about morals, decisions, the generation gap, teen dating, (some of the statistics that are given in this movie are astounding. They sound like today's stats).|1
"I first saw this movie in the theater. I was 10. I just watched it a second time and I must say it was amazing. The music, the dancing, the acting. It is a great story and told extremely well. I fell absolutely in love with Treat Williams when I was a kid after seeing him in this movie. One of my favorite parts was when his mom kept yelling at him to give her his pants, and then finally said ""how much do you need""? (money). That was classic. ; )."|1
"whomever thought of having sequels to Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case once was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. Iron Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch Iron Eagle III, but from looking at the R rating, I assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the always delightful ""Chappy"" Sinclair."|1
There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well. The main reason is the large amount of time spent on such a complicated story. A great deal of time is spent on the making of this story, which is the very reason to make this one. This one is really about the art of creating a film that can be read on a big screen. You can’t tell the whole story, just the idea behind the story. What you see is not just a movie.|0
After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker. Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an American, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. What we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men who return home from the war. One descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancé at the same time.|1
One of Bolls better attempts . Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by reading it! What are you currently doing? Well, I’ve written a lot about writing, and I’m really excited to see what it is going to take, how it affects the people I’ve become friends with, how I’d like to move on. In this post we are going to cover the process of writing my first book. This book is a work of art, so let’s talk about what it will do.|0
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie . If at one point I am going to watch it, I would like to go ahead and watch it with the person who made it, for me the story is going to be a great one . The characters are good enough, I am not going to miss them if you like it . It is the same story and the story goes way back . I would really like to see how it will go so far in the long term. I do like that you can tell the story in a few days .|0
"Two little girls strike a friendship. One tries to convince the other she's a witch. The other is a pushover who bends to the would be witch's will. On and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls, with many a dramatic cut away as they pose ""shocking"" questions. You know, the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask, such as, ""How do you make a deal with the devil""? Oooh... creepy.In the end, the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend."|1
I have viewed this cartoon as a child , a father , and now a grand-father . It is my hope that this work will show you how to become an active father in his children , and in the world that he and his family live in! If you have any questions about this cartoon or anything related, please feel free to post them in comments . Thanks for reading and if you have any comments , feel free to comment with your own comments or on-line comments on my website. I also hope to hear from you in the future . Thank you.|0
This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment I 've ever experienced with a film . The acting is excellent . It has always been my dream to put this film in a theater, but now it's been ruined. The film was a big disappointment but was worth it because I didn't have the budget and the budget to make a decent set. I would have been surprised if any of them could have gone to that theater in NYC and it would have been even better if they had been in the West Wing . . .|0
Don't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting. Sure, it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little B-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head.As I said, the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so I can't really complain. The story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing.|1
CAUTION SPOILER : At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days ago, but no one had any clue where to find the other bridge. This is the moment when they finally got a clear clue about it and were able to repair the bridge in time, but they did it without knowing what happened next. Now, I'm sure the guy who posted the story has seen the movie. He didn't get the details from me, but there's a few things that you don't have to read to be able to read this book.|0
I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition . It was billed as the first of three films to be nominated in Germany . There’s been no word on what was going on before this week’s competition . There has been no confirmation that it was actually directed by his own team. We’d been expecting the film to be released this year but we did get the idea that he is working with someone else . We did get the opportunity to see a trailer of this film in a recent film festival .|0
This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in San Jose. It's a musical, which normally I don't like, but I have to say this one was different. Robert Peters, who directed the film and stared in it, did such a wonderful job. During his Q & A he told the audience that he only had two other people for his crew! Most of the dialouge was made up on the fly and he actually made the film while attending another film festival in Germany!|1
I saw Heaven 's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago . Tickets were sold in advance based on price and were in stock. I had just moved in and was amazed by how it looked to see a new-age house at the old building in which it was located. Since then I have lived at this new home for many years and have taken in many times as much enjoyment as I could from the fact that I have a new car, new kitchen, and a new friend. The house is situated in a nice rural area near the old bridge and I have enjoyed spending time there.|0
"Well , after the hype surrounding the film and after Surya labeling the film as PATH-BREAKING , I went into the movie and read the book ""The Last of the Night"", which is based on the classic novel by Surya. What was quite interesting about my review of it was that I understood the book by the way. And I think, the book had a lot of flaws. So I guess, the book is basically a sequel to that novel. I thought, how about the sequel? I had no idea! Thanks for the review, I would recommend it if you can."|0
Not good . Mostly because you do n't give a damn about what happens to all these people . Some of these people think that I'm a good person , but I still do. The other people are the people who are wrong . I don't mean to say I'm bad, but I think that I do n't care . I think what they think and what I do n't care . This is the way it works for you. And in the end, I've always been a better person and I try to stay true to myself .|0
This is one of L & H 's shorts most frequently cited as the first `` real '' L & H '' shorts. If you haven't got that, but if you're looking for L & H, you should see that it's the L&H shorts which have been around for as long as L&H has been around for the last 50-plus years, the first of which was L&H shorts, the second of which was ''real '' L & H shorts, and finally, the L & H shorts which have now been around a bit longer than those which were around.|0
Not having any idea what this film was about , but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing on the DVD, I’m not 100 percent sure if he’s trying to tell people something, but if he isn’t, I’d love to hear him say something. It’s been fun playing the film all year. A: It is a story about a love affair, a friendship. B: The movie is about a girl. A love affair is a long-term affair between two women. She’s going to die.|0
This film , for what it was set out to be , succeeded . It 's a short tragic film , and its conclusion is that it can 't do justice to its protagonist , but it could not do justice to the many characters in its history. The fact that he was born in England , has been recognised as having an impact upon his family ; it's a sad, melancholy film and a tragic film . But it wasn't enough to make it a tragedy , and it can only be one of many , but it may have an impact on many of our children .|0
Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor , and when I first saw it I knew that this was not the end. I read a number of reviews from the forums and read their advice, but didn’t find a solution. What I found was that there are more than a handful of games, and that most of them had a different setting for them. I haven’t bought any of my old game titles, but I do know the ones that I bought from the shops I’d buy.|0
"This is another of Robert Altman's underrated films(let's be honest, the only movie he's made that really didn't work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives a spellbinding performance in it.She is far better here than she was in ""The Out of Towners"". The material, I will admit, is beneath the great director Altman and the extraordinary actress Dennis, but that hardly matters anyway.As long as there allowed to do their thing and do it well, just about any story will do."|1
"I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night . I 'm 20 years old and this movie is not for him. He doesn't like to talk about me. He just loves to watch the movie. I don't want him to see this movie but I hope that he does not want me to watch it. I have watched all of 'em all before and they are my favorite films of the year. It's been a long time since anyone has made a movie called ""The Cat Is Dead"", and I do not know when it would be released."|0
"Having loved Stephen King's novels and short stories for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works. A few notable exceptions are ""Stand By Me"" from ""The Body"", ""Carrie"" from the novel of the same name, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from ""Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with Stephen King's name attached to it in any way. It is no surprise that Mr. King has pretty much disavowed any connection with it."|1
As a word of explanation , Disney 's `` The Kid '' has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Brown kid from the 1950s '' cartoon '' of the original cartoon. But the only thing Disney has is an attitude that many children have seen. When I heard that Disney had created a Mickey Mouse character in the 1980's Disney had no idea, I knew it was wrong. When I hear Disney say that kids love to interact with the cartoon, I want to be honest with you about how much it does for the Disney cartoon.|0
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books list. You can check out a short movie that I think you should check out at this link for some great short films, I know there are some bad films in the list but I have a feeling it should be some good and I think it's the best one. This is a very, very well written and written film. There's some great scenes that were scenes that were shot over a long time and I think you'll enjoy the film, it's beautiful and well done.|0
This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn't want to be confronted.|1
This can hardly be called a good movie , actually it 's not even close . But I have to say it is pretty darn good , you know , it has a very cool visual , and I really liked the soundtrack . So much so, it would not be bad to have this movie . . . You may have heard that this movie is called . The name was called , but this movie is actually called . It's also called , but I don't think there is much . But I was really surprised by it . I love it , I had just seen it before .|0
It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies ! And there are plenty of things in which they will not work, in fact it seems to be a classic case of the art of spoofing :-). For example, some sports movies may be made of a very different style :-). In fact, such movies may not have any such features, either, except that they have very similar content as other film-makers' sports films. And there is a difference in quality between their films.|0
this is film is probably one of the best i 've seen so far . i would put it only in one shot and it looks great on the big screen - i would even give this as a gift to friends i have . theres a way that can be used in the future to have a great view and great performance but i don't feel as though i would be a fan of the movies in particular but its a bit more work to create a movie to use in the future but im not sure whether it is good enough to make a movie in future.|0
Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women being held by Indians, which essentially all there is to this film. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers make off with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men make their stand at an island in a creek bed.|1
I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got . The acting was just awful. The acting was terrible but I'm sure he would've liked to see more of it, but unfortunately, I think it's probably a better film and his acting was bad. I was looking for a little more of that and wanted something that I think I was doing well, which I think is why I did it. I thought the acting was better but not as good. I don't know what he thought he was doing, but he thought it was just a little more of that.|0
Jeff Leroy wanted to makes fun of Scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. The twist is that instead of frail old L. Ron Hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. It doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood.|1
Brilliant Aussie movie... A little slow at the beginning, but once it gets going you can't stop laughing. When I originally saw the movie I vaguely knew the plot line, as I am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and more so in particular, the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed). I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening...|1
"Enormous suspension of disbelief is required where Will 's `` genius '' is concerned . Not just in math -- it is not a mathematical genius! I think you will be very surprised to learn that all the mathematicians I've ever heard call him 'manipul' (as in, he ""isn't that nice"") is just a little bit. And not just a little bit. He's a very smart mathematician -- not just a mathematician as such. In his mind, he can go anywhere and find something else that looks the same."|0
"Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is ""nott"" very good at all. I sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and camera work is bad. As I hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet, it is ""nott"" even worth the bandwidth.Up until the time I wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10's for it, obviously voted on by liars and shills."|1
A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore . However , it’s a little disappointing that so much money and effort is spent on it, in part because we are not as good as it should be in a market, and that is why there is such a massive difference in quality between being an actor and being an acting student. As a first-time student it seems a bit strange that so many people in this country spend $500 or more on acting and I would like to clarify that this is not really the case.|0
"Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except note that it needs editing-the hand held technique gets really old, really fast). I saw this film last night in Menerbes, France-we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and of course wine makers. They were all there in the Salle de Polyvalente for the showing-crammed in. Polite, patient, genial. Although my French is testy, I got the gist of the film but noted that the audience loved the ""old"" terror growers interviewed-esp."|1
"What to say about ""Dead End Road""...Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. The acting, writing, effects, and everything in this movie was just horrendous. That doesn't even do justice! This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had to sit through. That is also why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally I didn't care what happened to the characters. I have seen bad but this was definitely the worst. I got hyped up for this because I am a fan of Poe and this was just bad."|1
Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version, with some of the scenes taken out? It makes me think less of a film that does that, showing a definite want of creativity. In all fairness, I tend to be biased in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times, and then this version took the script, the music, and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version.|1
This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever . It really does not qualify for movie status, and you are not really going to see it . This is a very good film, but it goes to a much lesser place than what you are going to see in real life. And I am pretty sure that the film is going to make no difference to the way some people perceive it and what it has actually looked like. You might be thinking the film was being made to put a lot more emphasis on what it was, but there has never been a film to that.|0
To my eternal shame , I 've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire films. But when I heard the story of a vampire, and how the story turned out, I started wondering if the film was too light or too loud. After a couple of years of thinking about that, I figured out a way to bring it to light in a different way. I had to take my camera and set it up in some way that I can see how the story would unfold in the movie.|0
I hate to admit it, but they were right to sack Schrader. The opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. It wasn't done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The directing was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone.|1
Sadly this film lives up to about 1 % of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves out a few of the most popular games of all time. And yet you’ve watched it on a daily basis over the last 20 years. And you have no clue what made it special – the graphics. It’s actually a fantastic game and a great story. But if you look hard enough into the story and characters you get there’s a great plot and a great story, but you’ll have no idea who these characters actually are.|0
Not really worth a review, but I suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this Canadian bomb floating around out there... Bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. At firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model... However all this changes... and you still won't care.|1
Piranha starts out as expected, stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while it might be a cannibal film. It starts off like so many others, showing nothing but shots off untouched Amazon rain forest. For all I know it could be Florida. At this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up. Instead you get the acting talents of William Smith, who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe, an acclaimed hunter, who I would describe him as Jack Palance Light.|1
I go this game and it is alright I guess . I just expected a bit more . The main thing I want is I want a game with a story that will have you playing the main game. I don't think you will find it easy. It is pretty basic but you can follow the instructions and follow the rules. It's a very short game which is very fun to play. It is about the story which is really about a character from a fairy story. You can see there are a lot of points in the story.|0
Chop Shop , the second feature from Ramin Bahrani , is a rare breed . It is an American film-going breed, but a very distinct breed , and it’s hard to overstate how rare. The first thing to note, is that it’s a breed from New Zealand, a breed that has been a leading producer on Ramin Bahrani and has been a resident of Melbourne for more than 20 years. It is not one of the great producers on Ramin Bahrani itself, but if you want to understand the difference between it and Ramin Bahrani you can find more information on Ramin Bahrani in our article.|0
Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an Aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.Turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, one I've heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology.|1
"I 'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70 's and early 80 's and John D. 's '40s. While most shows on television now have their own format, it's a bit of a stretch to say, at least for me, the show isn't as ""classic"" as some would like it to be. If anything it's just as old as the shows I love, but most of my time on a show with the same cast, and there's no reason to call it ""classic."""|0
"The most amazing film I have ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I just stumbled onto the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what I saw. I only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about ""punishment park"" in the U.S. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the US if you are from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way."|1
You know sometimes you just got ta have it ? That 's how this movie is with me . I'm really glad you said that you made it, you're very sweet and that's the best part , I have to go now and I'm sure you will too ! I'm glad you did the gift for the movie and I can't wait to see it. You're very nice and very nice. Thank you. I was really hoping you'd show up for the next one but it is not that way with me . I've always enjoyed the movies so far .|0
I 've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film . It seemed dull to me , much as it should be . . . and I think it's worth mentioning here . . . and it's a shame, as I was so surprised that there was such interest . . . but what I didn't know was I was very impressed by the film . . . and I don't . . . have any reason to think that I'll never find the type of movie I've wanted, as a result I'm very happy that it was the first one I have ever seen .|0
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.That 's reason enough for all of us and we don't have to go back and tell you about her, because this time we want to see her in it, she's still a beautiful, and beautiful person. But as we're going to get into her life so I want to make her happy, and I don't know what she wants, I don't know what I'm supposed to say or do, there's so much more to it than that.'|0
I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; the sequels still surprise or amaze meby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. They constitute or forge a 4th waynot classic, not revisionist, not Europeanbut a sleaze Americana, kindred to the violent vigilante '70s movies, absurd trash. This installment too is bombastic sleazeinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange.Now what I find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original's style and the sequels'.These sequels are not boring or insipidbut bizarre.|1
"I can't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use that term very loosely) centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complex--at least I think that's what it was about. The script made no sense at all, I couldn't have cared less about the characters and the camera-work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African American male, I often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to ""support African American films."""|1
This movie is bad . I saw the rated and the unrated versions . They are terrible ! ! Now I have read that the movies can also be better . Not only that, because of it , movies are rated . I don't find out about their rated . It can be better. Now this movie doesn't really work , just the way it looks on the screen. It is so bad that I'm scared of it. Now I've seen it but I don't have the time . I'm pretty sure that I did something wrong, I don't feel like it should be the case.|0
"In order to pull off a job like this caper in Rififi ( e.g . The Score and its opines ), I've got a question for you. My question is: ""How can Rififi (and I, for the moment, prefer it)"" be turned into a 'cap' of sorts? And if that was so, what was the best way to pull this caper? I am looking into some of the different ways a person can play a game like this. I've got a pretty good list of things I could use to turn it into a caper."|0
I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie ( Bella Martha/Mostly Martha ) , and everything that was before it, except that the movie was based on what happened to me on that particular evening. The movie was a bit disappointing ( and it's not) for me. As I mentioned previously , I've been a bit confused and I've got to change my mind about this movie. I was going to say to my friend that I would like to have a little more fun with this movie, so I will be making a post that I will talk about in more detail about it.|0
"Barely came trough the whole movie... Acting is bad, dialogs are even worse. Felt kinda st00pid 4 watching it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so I struggled trough. They even screwed up the sound. At certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud, that i had to turn the volume down. It would be great, if this was a competition about who can screw up more.Oh and PS: I don't know what's this guy ""Uwe"" capable of creating..."|1
"I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, ""The Book is always better than the movie"" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison."|1
This film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a American dad with a kid. For a while it seemed like he got it right and then made it a little bit more obvious that it’s for kids. Then he decided to let it go, just to keep it in mind. Now it’s kind of funny to watch him doing that. He said that in his movie it means something to the story, and that the story is about a little girl, which was just not the case here.|0

"Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrayal of a Vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a ""family."" Sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize. The setting is Thanksgiving Day and the relatives are coming for dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning vet, wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner, explaining ""This is what I wore last Thanksgiving."""|1
Dodgy plot , dodgy script , dodgy almost everything in fact . The most compelling performance is that of Joanna. It was very entertaining to watch, as she played the leading role in the film and made a couple of films. She is one of the few people who does not have any problem with the direction of some of the most famous films of the 20th or 21st century, The Little Mermaid, The Pirates of the Caribbean and Pirates of the Caribbean 2. And if I had not come across her film, I would have not seen the story of her.|0
"I have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of the music video to give you both a good feeling of how things really are:

I saw this movie as early as I could remember, but I only ever watched it in the early 1990s anyway. This is my favorite film in the history of film history, for it shows just how bad music can be if it gets too loud. But it is also a film about what the music world was like in the beginning and what it looked like in the middle when it was most popular."|0
"When a movie's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen's younger, less known brother stars in it, you know it's not gonna' be a real good one. ""Soultaker"" is a low budget, silly film about a group of 20-something year olds being pursued by an angel of death. It's a stupid movie, but it is pretty entertaining, and even somehow slightly likable in it's stupidity.The plot in the film is very small, and it's stretched about as far as it possibly can be."|1
The name of this film and the clips that I saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace. It started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings. As they found dead bodies, or should I say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason why? At times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert.|1
I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, which scared the hell out of me. But when I saw the actual film, I was disappointed. The acting is stilted, and the attempts at comedy are woefully out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a turd in a bedpan is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the Bell Witch legend, so I know quite a bit about it.|1
"This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s, in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (""will the show STILL go on?""). While of course none of this is new, it was enjoyable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life, Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film."|1
When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice , as my original intent was sold and I was told it would be an adventure. When I went back I could not watch the movie because I was too scared for anything to see. Then I found out it was not a movie for my personal taste but for my family. The first movie I saw was called The World is Beautiful. It was based off of a book by the same authors and they said it was great. The first thing I noticed about The World is that it is not in a series of films.|0

My jaw dropped when I read that company , so this is some huge ironic conspiracy going on . Here is an example

Five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping. Were they run into their childhood nemeses as well as escaped convicts in this supreme unfunny supposed comedy. Most of the cast are content to simply phone it in, and don't really seem to care about the film in the least. The writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are, for the most part, the name of the actors that respectively play them. Richard Lewis's shtick gets really old REALLY quick. Even the late great character actor, Brion James can't save this stinker.|1
This is one of the best episodes from the entire X-Files series , creepy beyond words . The tension and mystery of these stories have given me a great deal of interest in the future of X-Files , and the first and second few moments of the series make up for that. X-Files isn't like any other series I've played, but it's something that I'm enjoying the most. In fact, I absolutely love the first two moments of X-Files , but the first is so great that it completely takes away all of the tension I've been looking for the most.|0
"Forget the lousy acting, that can be forgiven in this sort of film. Or even the terrible, unnatural dialog and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was said). Far worse is the blatant absence of a skillful or experienced director who maybe took a holiday with the editor while the film was being made? Watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? A dial up internetconnection? Clucky ghost images photoshopped on pictures (""He!"|1
`` Mararía '' really disappointed me . I ca n't consider it as a bad movie , but the development of the movie is just beautiful .

Before you watch this movie - clean your ears , take away the make-up from your eyes and tell your friend about it . So if you want to get better, go to Google. If you don't want to get fancy, I don't know what you should do . This was the most common mistake that many of you probably make - so you might as well just buy a cheap pair of sunglasses to go off in the mirror. This is also one that is often a part of your life. This is how you make it possible for your life to come together.|0
A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas by the same director. My feelings about both films are in fact the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this film in a Sneak Preview, and left after half an Hour. Couldn't stand it anymore. How can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are, and how perfect their lives are.........? I had a fantasy about a forgotten American G.I., still wandering around in the Vietnamese jungle, who was not aware the war had ended.|1

This movie was so poorly acted. What was with Jeff Bridges accent, horrible and unbelievable. Was it supposed to be French, Scandinavian?The script was lame. To have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the Jeff Bridges character...are you kidding me? How convenient that Jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn. Do these people just not believe in calling the cops? Okay...I'll get into the car with you, why not? DUH!|1

"I'm not here to tell you ""Armored"" is Kubrickian, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nope. Referenced directors are more like Don Siegel (""Charlie Varrick"") and Walter Hill (""The Warriors""). Those two helmers didn't fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies. No skirts need apply. They unapologetically made guy movies. Guns, lots of guns. Men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw. Their movies were like a sap to the head. You want a friend? Get a dog. ""Armored"" is so a guy movie."|1
"A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world, have not gone extinct...yet. The survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white, and yellow suits, fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters. ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"" is a peculiar movie. Like I said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors."|1
Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh 's head , which is always hidden from me and my friends , is why I was so enthusiastic , but when I saw a picture of it , I started freaking out so much that it got out of control. I was also excited when the movie came out. The film has been a lot longer than that, even with the original screenplay , which had a bit of time to develop itself and to shoot it properly and have a great shot.|0
Yeah great cult TV series . Great atmosphere , top script and good performances make this a class A candidate to star in a lot of other TV series and films as well . It is a shame to lose the opportunity to show a great show with a bad script . And to be honest , I would say this is a good candidate to star a great story . I just hope they make an offer in the very short time available to cast a great cast , who can also provide a memorable cast for the show .|0
This is one great, sweeping, movie you will remember for a long time. It is about history, America, the change of times, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, a kidnapped American and her children, and the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the Prophet in his veins.This movie is based on a true story--like Jesse James was a banker. An American WAS kidnapped in Morocco and the Marines went part-way to the shores of Tripoli to rescue him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is the Berber chieftain and Muslim leader.|1

I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn't always the way with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.)|1
Hollywood had a long love affair with bogus Arabian Nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. The most memorable were the Jon Hall, Maria Montez films which have long since become camp. This one is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and slapstick. It's a truly bounteous crop of Mesopotamian corn, and pretty near intolerable today. It was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age, consisting mainly of trick photography. The only outstanding, positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity.|1
This is the essence of the early eighties! The malls, the credit card machines, the food, the punk hair color, the soundtrack... I am in love with this movie. This sweet, intelligent Romeo & Juliet teen flick is instantly addictive.Martha Coolidge is one of my favorite directors. She really employs her actors, like John Hughes and Steven Soderberg, so check out -Joy of Sex- and -Real Genius-. The soundtracks for -Valley Girl- are great. If you can find a copy of the film, buy it! It's out of print and very hard to come by.|1
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners, Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move.|1
I'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'these kind of movies'.While I very well can enjoy a good mindless Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like the 'dogma' kind of movies, or 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, IF they are well made.A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy locations. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie.Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy locations?|1
Plodding, maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two- hour drag. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that lights up this film.|1
I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.|1
Once again, Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people. This time the traveling circus put a lion's cage right over the rabbit's hole. So Bug's has to come out of the hole and face Nero (that's the name of the lion), which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart, it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious. Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one, if still shorn of a classic.|1
OK , most of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake , but at the same time I am convinced that they really are trying to make things work, so it appears they are. I like this movie. It looks really good. The characters, the humor, the dialogue is just good. The story is just amazing. I really hope they are doing this. The cast is very young. The director is a young guy. The voice actors are very young. The main character is almost 6 years old. The story is not as good as I anticipated.|0
You know , this is one of those `` Emperor 's New Clothes '' films . It 's like , it is not so hard to find in a film. What I want to do is ask you a couple more questions about that one of them. Why do they come up with this ? What happens if it gets too hard? What's the point? Where does the point comes from ? I want to tell you one of these questions. I want to ask you one of them. It would be interesting to hear about the differences between them.|0
And obviously I didn't see it! But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I know now to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they're not going to catch continuity errors. A supposedly dead Doug Masters returning is a big giant one, won't you say?And I can't believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return for something like that.Did Jason Gedrick really decline this?|1
If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or creating the layout that actually makes it possible, but don't know that I'd want to do that. If I was to do it that way I would be able to do it. Thanks in advance. Also, this picture looks great. If I'm going to go in and do the same thing again I would have to figure out a way to do what you did, but this one feels a little bit better (I think).|0
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot! So what to do with her? And what does she do? Well, as you may know it is the only book to contain such a fascinating mystery. You will have read all she has done to make her a great detective, but there is much you will never be able to understand. So read on! Agatha Christie is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century, a woman who is one of the most brilliant and brilliant of all writers.|0
"My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60's... so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation. I should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the Louvre.The idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting (the fantom of Le Louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. The dialogues hesitate permanently between French irony and serious ""American business"" without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine.Acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect (low budget ?"|1
Right up (or down) there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace.The premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness, and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot.If you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it. The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. Too bad too, because coming in I thought it would be bad but held out hope. It may be the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot.|1
Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian air force combat training and now a Navy Seal is shown here during the latest State of Defense National Guard demonstration in Moscow, Russia October 17, 2017, in the Russian port of Leningrad, Russia (AP, AFP) - The Russian Defense Ministry has revealed that the Russian Navy Seal of the Air (SERAS) has now retired. SERAS (SERES) is a combat medical unit built for the Defense Ministry to train and assist medical officers and staff in combat.|0
this movie is honestly the worst piece of rubbish i have ever seen. this is slow, plot less and boring. the cinematographer deserved to be shot. There were various aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared being oddly camp. Raised many laughs but also many yawns. don't watch with anyone, anytime any place. If u hate someone, recommend they buy or rent this. big waste of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant...not. i cant think of anything else to say except Don't ever see this movie, it will make u want to jump off a cliff.|1
"Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach, they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers. Nice-girl local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.Hearkening back to films like ""The Bad Seed"" and ""Village of the Damned"", this films' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it's still pretty disturbing. All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy, Billy Jacoby, and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing."|1
The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and watch all my friends movie from the beginning of the movie. I’m so glad that I finally found out the bad news about the movie and finally realized that the bad news in movie is so great! Now it’s time for you to give us some advice about the good news. First off let’s make a big mistake and say that there were a lot of good news. We’re just going to give you the good news.|0
Wow . The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid . I realize that this movie was supposed to be about someone who's been killed by a terrorist - who has not - but I can't find any of the locations in that movie where that person is killed and who is in custody, as I can only find two scenes where they are killed and are transported to the prison that is in the movie and not in a prison film. It's the only time we get to see someone who was killed and the prisoners are held to account for this.|0
I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth . She played well in this movie , but the plot was boring and the characters were weak . When I read about it with my son, I thought this was the time for me to buy a movie in the best movie category in the country . But it turns out it was not. I bought it because I knew that we are all like this . You can see that in the movie , I liked it very much , and I had to watch it in another movie .|0
Trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. I don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. As for the song, it's mildly amusing. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. Whenever this comes on, I try to encourage my child to watch something else.|1
"In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's. Leon, the leader of the Deuces, starts the gang after his brother OD's on ""junk"". He vows to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge.The movie didn't really do it for me. The ""Good Guys"" weren't any more good than the ""Bad Guys"". Very little was shown to suggest that the Deuces really cared for the community. I suppose the writers were going for realism here, but I just didn't care which side won."|1
Ocean 's twelve is probably better than Ocean 's eleven . I know most people would disagree , But I am not sure it makes you better or vice versa . I don't think it would even make me better, but I have to say the ocean is certainly better than Ocean 's eleven . I know majority of people would agree , but I am not certain . It's the first time I've ever heard Ocean's eleven compared to the other twelve in any one category. I was pretty much convinced that Ocean's eleven was better than Ocean 's eleven .|0
Last year , I fell in love with the Tim Burton 's version of Sweeney Todd so I wanted to take it a little more seriously. I came up with a name for Sweeney Todd , because I was interested in using the characters as some kind of ‘story’ and to make my own ‘story’, I decided to take the story from there and I made some character models to do so I would get inspiration for the story as I needed. The first picture is a guy’s life story where he and his brother are looking for a new house to take to the next town.|0
Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee 's `` She 's just a girl. I had the opportunity to go on about it and I 'd be honest. It was a real challenge. However, after my first few sessions, I finally got to talk to the woman. We talked on the phone and I asked her about what she wanted to do next, which I had done, as I could not find an easy answer for her. And that's what I was doing.|0
My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of `` bad '' movies . We didn't even have to wait for the last one. And now I need to get back. It was a long day. A long drive from New York. It was cloudy, with a high-altitude sky in the center of the city. We were parked outside a building, and in front of the building were a small pool. My heart thumped into my rib. It felt like my heart was in a punchline. I could feel my chest.|0
Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens . It showed in all my pictures and I have never regretted it! I do wish that people would be able to see more pictures of their pets and not have to be afraid to have them around to be photographed. It has been my experience that people tend to see the pet in front of them and that they are more concerned with it than the other pictures. This has led me to believe that people have the correct amount of sympathy towards them when they view them as pets.|0
If a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands , the world would be in grave danger . . . or else it would turn into a mass grave . . . There was so much drama . . . There wasn't even the slightest bit of humor . . . But I'm not sure what to do. There's something very wrong in the way you describe the movie's ending. It was pretty funny to see. You didn't know what to make of the movie. Instead, the movie was set on a different planet, and you watched the entire episode.|0
The wind and the lion is a marvelous sweeping motion picture. It is a monument to what filmmaking once was but is no more.Connery, despite the thick scottish brogue, plays the Raisulu very well. He inspires the viewer in a way many lead characters cannot. Candice Bergen, in one of her early roles, is marvelous as the kidnapped socialite Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and plenty of humour as well). A marvelous film, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.|1
I posted on IMDb on this series recently, giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to appeal release. I wrote to that address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity prominently. I just received the following reply: From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT To: kk2840@earthlink.net Dear Kate, I work for the BBFC, the British equivalent to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country.|1
"The minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies. Then there's the robbery itself, a wordless, thirty minute nail-biter that has never been surpassed, followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel, and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies.This was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today. (It displays some of the edgy brutality of Dassin's earlier ""Brute Force"")."|1
"... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into ""One foot in the grave"", etc. I admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people ? They are cold bores.Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging."|1
I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show . It is so boring . The jokes are so repetitive . The actors don't have a lot of time for that . I don't know how I would pay for it if it were that simple . Is that a big deal ? Oh. I think it would make your life easier. I'm in the mood to watch it. I'm trying to work out how to find out what to watch. It isn't that simple . Just watch the comedy for a while .|0
***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements. First off a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the puppets turn good in this sequel. Finally, It introduces some scifi/fantasy elements as well.A new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay, his girlfriend, her psychic friend, and that psychics boyfriend, stumble upon Andre Toulon's puppet trunk. They also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds Toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving.|1
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. I love shark movies and this one just disappoints. I've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work.|1
The movie was very good . I 'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to watch the movie. It was a very exciting day in town and I was excited about what was going on with the kids. My mom was telling me how great we were as a family and I 'm not the type to just be surprised. It was fun and I was excited and excited and I'm glad I read this and I think I will be a wonderful mom. That's all for now, thanks a lot for coming along. You are welcome.|0
This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.Normally I don't write reviews, but I was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. While I admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. The only reason I watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer.|1
What i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so undeserving, so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons. There is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's CGI effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them. With that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction. Well, guess what, the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next Wednesday's episode.|1
Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and easy-to-follow documentary. And that's a lot of time for an actor, director, writer, and director. So, for the first time, I think it's about a friendship. Or perhaps a connection, perhaps a friendship. And then there is the question of how the film can be a film that explores the world of the characters. At the heart of the work is the relationship between the director and the director's wife.|0
the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who 's a real bastard and he wants to launch 'em out of the ocean.' He's not the type of man who would go on his own and do exactly what he wants for himself, but he is. This guy has been a big help in this movie for a lot of different reasons and they all deserve our respect. And that's fine. In the beginning, you have a submarine builder who wants to build you a new boat and he wants to build you another.|0
"The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's ""Nine Lives"" comes when Sissy Spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with Aiden Quinn, find a nature documentary on television, at which point Quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene, predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. Characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories, but none of them ever seem to really connect."|1
I 'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair , but the female villain in this movie had no clue . . . it was so cool to have such an awesome character! I loved the movie and I have to admit that I was completely disappointed in that version of it. I really didn't get why I loved it. I think it was the story that really helped me think about the story, and just think it was interesting to have the female protagonist being on a different side of the world. And the movie didn't really help.|0
"Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us a little of his Retromedia ""goodness"" in the form of this soft-core Cinemax non-classic.A numb-nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a ""black hole"" as the intelligent dolts put it. Pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time-line and she beds her way into the future. Pretty soon her studly other half makes his way into the future as well and blazes a path through the beds of the future.Ray again delivers a passable (but barely) smut-fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin."|1
This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80. The jokes in the show are so lame. If you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage.... You will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform...It really pisses me of that viewers gave Reba 6.7 on their voting...Sure i knew there are some people with IQ lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them!|1
"It's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. But even by that low standard this is a terrible film.Essentially an anthology movie, this fourth installment in the Hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time. An ambitious idea. But none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director Yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling. The result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. Unless you're an ""Alan Smithee"" fan, avoid this one."|1
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film . On its surface , the movie tells the story of a woman who lives a lonely existence in a house on a cliff edge, in a small town in a country where she's raised a young man with a dreamy quality. The movie is written and directed by a small team of young filmmakers , all based around the author's vision and approach to what a woman with dreams can do, what an author might say, and what a relationship could have to it.|0
A beautiful film . One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed . Made me think, “If it makes you feel better when it comes to sex, how about I tell you so? I mean that’s why I love you’s dick. I’d like that. So if I can’t feel guilty or overwhelmed by sex it might be a bad thing”. This is the kind of film I wish I could make more of. It was a great movie, but I wasn’t as happy as I could be.|0
Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film, as neither the title, nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film  which goes to show, me and everyone, that a DVD shouldn't be judged by it's cover. ***SPOILERS*** The film felt like it was trundling along, not really going anywhere for the moment  the awkwardness of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch, and the fringe on the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (as Alexondra Lee) being too school-girlish to watch.|1
This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long long time (and I've recently seen Starship Troopers 2!!!). I could find nothing to redeem this film. The acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. Denis Hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be. Vinnie Jones accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her acting is pretty poor but I doubt that's why shes there.The dialogue is truly appalling.|1
"As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film, I find it very interesting how few ,""middle of the road"" comments there are. Everyone either loves it, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times, and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines????? ), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film."|1
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. Also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film. In listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the AARF show(Robert Morgan is a co-host)he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such,there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film. I think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more.|1
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone 's favorite master of suspense . As usual , the technical elements such as the location, the setting, the author , the book and the story were a delight. So how did I find it? This is a simple piece of advice that could have been helpful for you. The following is an excerpt of an interview I gave earlier this year. JAMES DICKLETON: There were a couple of different ideas to think about before I came along. The first one was that there was going to be a very long story.|0
I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. My first thoughts were that I have never been more ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie to be down right appalling. Please don't waste your time. As for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope that I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is.|1
"Who doesn't love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the ""magic"" transcends all that other stuff."|1
"I watched this movie the other night, and I have to admit, it was quite possibly the best film of this generation. Turns out I wasn't born until 1988, but I can relate to this motion picture like Cary Grant can relate to having an STD, or Burt Reynolds to being a burnout. Marky Mark did not decline in awesomeness after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I will from here on refer to as ""the best band in the world (aka BBW). Like, it's totally a morality tale about fargin' trannies an' poop, so pay attention!"|1
"The first time I saw this was when I was with a date , and she thought it was an incredible idea

I was sitting there and was looking up at the map with a huge smile on my face. This was the second time that I had ever seen this. “How are we doing so far?”

“Ok, we should go on our own.”

“Can I take a guess on what your next step is?”

I’m no expert but I’ll tell you what my next step should be

So this is the final time that I am going to ask this question."|0
"Finally ! Third time lucky . This film has been always been on my mind , but my first viewing this night and I was excited for a second time. Here you will find the details about the day of the first appearance of the new film! Watch the video on my Facebook page (facebook.com)

You could have seen the first film here in a while. But what if you were not a fan of the film? Now that it has been over and over again, what is the good news? Here we will have to share that good news as the movie is finally released on February 20th."|0
Possibly the worst movie I ever saw . The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film a scene before he shot it. There is a good reason to not film something, but it does mean it doesn't hurt the other actors in the film who are not as talented in the way of their film, or the actors whose films are more important to the film, but they are not great in their work, or their work is better because the actor who shot something is not good at film production.|0
This movie doesn't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good. It is truly appalling. Its closer to a tongue-in-cheek parody than a disaster movie, but alas they were serious. Made for TV, but not worthy of even that. It contains every cliché and cheesy plot moment you can imagine. Oh will he save the town from the flood? Will his wife admit that she still loves him? Will they escape before the flood drowns them? I cant explain how bad this is. Awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy.|1
the mario series is back , and in my opinion , better than ever . Galaxy is the most creative of all, and I feel that the quality of the series is not enough, even after its release. But since I feel like its been a long time since i have watched this series on a TV, i have to say that this series was a really beautiful one . I really like the series, but i have watched the series on Netflix for two years , i think its the best . i think i watched this series on a channel for two years , the series was great .|0
"NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like ""Waterworld"" than anything else. I don't recall a Bible passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one where Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember Noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like ""hoist the mainstay!"""|1
Most people will consider that Yul Brynner 's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND THE KINGDOM (1866) as an example of how much of his work actually came to be appreciated. (It can be argued that, since Yul Brynner was probably best-known throughout his time in the early 1960s, his works were often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential books ever written by an American writer). However, it is clear that, while Yul Brynner was considered the greatest work ever written by someone, there are many reasons why.|0
Whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? Only hope this is first and the last as well, for God's sake ! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like Tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. Why does Himesh not smile ?|1
"The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. It was just one of those movies that I came across in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully. Unfortunately ""interesting"" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from the ""in crowd"" and eventually starts hanging with them."|1
Created by Dennis Spooner , 'Department S ' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol , based on the real-life incident that happened on November 20, 2009. The show's premise is about a British citizen accused of murdering his neighbour, but a police officer can't prove that the person is in fact the murderer because he doesn't have any evidence that the crime has been committed. The show had two main elements: the murder itself (the murder itself was staged by the police officer who shot the woman in the head), and the murder's aftermath.|0
Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors , Christopher Nolan was a master . Nolan is also a great director , who has mastered many of the classics from his earlier movies , such as The Matrix , Prometheus , and The Sopranos , and has also mastered the horror classics from The Shining , The Dark Knight , The Matrix , Prometheus , and The X-Men films. With that, it’s not impossible that Nolan has made his name with his cinematic work, and this is his first foray into film as a director.|0

A potentially good idea gets completely let down by a weak script which throws all credibility out the window leaving the developer feeling that he has lost control of the project. He’s going to be using this script in a test build, so I will post some of the things that I will try. I have written this script before, so you might need to understand what a weak script is. I don’t have this in my development tools. It’s in a library called .js, which I have included. It’s pretty simple, but not very robust.|0
"Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema . Shot in the SouthernCalifornia desert using his patent faux documentary style. But there are some really important things that need to be said. 1. You know you have to use this film to create a sense of meaning

It’s pretty important to create a sense of meaning. For example, why should I use the word “giant” and the word “dwelling?” This is where the word ‘Giant’ is actually used in the sense that ‘Giant is really a big giant.’ What if there was an actual giant?"|0
I ca n't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely find it hard to believe any of these things. I think there's no doubt in the world that I never ever see them, and if I did see this on a regular TV show I'd swear I was watching it. I just don't. I do believe I have the world's worst nightmare. But I do believe I've gotten the worst from it. It's a nightmare of a thing I know and love.|0
"I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career, but ""The Possession of Nurse Sherri"" stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like ""Horror of the Blood Monsters"" and ""Dracula Vs. Frankenstein"". This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch ""Nurse Sherri""? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements from ""The Exorcist"", ""Ruby"", and ""Carrie"" is one of those nice, eerie little horror movies common to the seventies."|1
I 'm not sure whether i like this film or not . I think it is creepy and completely weird.Crispin...I was watching a recent film that was released a while ago.... LOL...I am glad to hear that but I just couldn't resist watching the movie and thought I'd check this out for you and give you some suggestions. I was watching the video and thought I'd give this a try for me. As you can imagine, I enjoyed the film. It was great and it was funny but it felt like a bad movie and a great story.|0
I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand . I was intrigued for the first whole 2 hours but I knew it would have me in a hurry . What was I thinking? That's what I would like to know right now . It was just a movie that I had never seen on film before . Well I know that would be impossible . In fact it was like watching a black and white movie on DVD . I was so confused to learn that this movie could be about me . I did think I saw the movie before I could think of what I was expecting.|0
"We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set, under the title ""The Broken Skull."" Shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, ""Evil Dead"" kind of way.Without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying ""hunh?"|1
Wow, I was told this would be a B movie worth watching. I feel that I was misled after seeing this preview event. The plot is a twisted make of several films at best. Even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit. I am sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I wouldn't waste your time on this one. This movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera.|1
`` The death of a performer at a Broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together to investigate murder in the wake of a tragedy at a popular playhouse and the murder of two of its actors. When it comes time for a murder trial to be presented in the courtroom, many people don't know what the trial looks like, and their lives are put on hold; they wait in the waiting room for an hour after the trial to be completed. It is a time when the theatre critic has to be ready to give her evidence before she's heard.|0
"The movie is nothing extraordinary. As a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about it borders on scary... not even close to the threshold of scary...It's just another case of ""another teenage horror movie""-seen one and you've seen em all. First few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. The worst part is, the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. Would have been better if it's written in Spanish."|1
"I don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy, and maybe I will in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was simple and no secret after the publicity. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the ""chemistry"" abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time. I LOVE this movie....and have the DVD on order!"|1
"I 'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with , but how did this seem to last so long ? I'm sorry I had to get this to myself but I still think I have a hard time with my writing now. :/

Well, the question is, what is the appropriate level of frustration with writing, as well as the amount of time it takes to get the article up and running and have it read and approved ? If there is a point I want to get into , I'll do my best to take it with me."|0
Have seen this movie today . Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist . The movie had been the only one for which a good movie could be made. I’m very happy about that movie and wonder what it’s going to do for my career . I wonder what the movie is going to do for the next few decades . The movie would probably be a classic . It’s an expensive movie . It wouldn’t last long . I wonder how well it would be re-released .|0
I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, I seriously don't think that Isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. I have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. I also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and I'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not.|1
I have n't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made ! Talk about a failure ! ! ! I think I have never laughed in this place. In the past, I have tried my best, but not quite enough! But here's the thing... I can't believe that I haven't seen it. In a lot of movies that I read, I have only seen a handful of scenes that I have seen. Not that there is anything I would not do myself if it had been one of them.|0
TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and this angers me because Van Damme is a personally favourite for B movie comedy. Segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself. It also annoys me how he didn't do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films.|1
"within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but the other one and it was more than helpful. i really appreciate your time! __________________
""When you read the book, don't take it seriously, read the book."" I've read it twice and never once. I'll try again later. I would say to watch it now so you can tell what to watch next. First, get your hands dirty. Also watch the first fight and see if it's a good fight."|0
I have only praise for this film . From start to finish it captured the brilliance of Stephen Sondheim 's performance, making it one of the finest cinematic performances of the year. From the beginning of the film, he is clearly in the position of director of the film who is not the kind of director who would be willing to give a film a second chance for being the pinnacle of the industry. However, when he is called upon again, it is as if the film is now being made in the studio itself.|0
"I can't say if ""The Cavern"" is a ripoff of ""The Cave"" because I haven't seen that. I've seen ""The Descent"" and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one. Hard to watch, as in, there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at. There are times when I guess, you're supposed to be scared, judging from the music, but scared of what? Bad camera work? Poor lighting?"|1
I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I must say, I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely mistaken. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it I simply loved. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine.|1
I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.WHAT??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I've seen. *spoilers* There were just so many fundamental problems with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except they aren't scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all.|1
I mean , come on ! This movie had such nice potential but it 's like they ran out of space. And then they got in the water. I was a little confused. You can see the pictures on youtube but it's more like a TV movie and they made some of the water go back down to the water. This movie was made a couple years back and I had no idea where to start. I watched it on youtube and now it is in the next one. Now I'm going to check it out.|0
This movie does n't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good . It is truly evil in every way. It would be hard for me to recommend it for any movie. It was good enough to make a movie I liked for a long time . I had a lot to be thankful for. I have been wanting to do a film like that for some years. And I had to look into it because I did not think it would help me in my new career and I couldn't do it in that film.|0
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who travels from town to town taking part time jobs, chasing women, and learning all he can about life. Kintaro has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made. He takes everything to the extreme, and it's just laugh out loud funny every time. From his constant never ending quest to study life, to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death matters.One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions.|1
Worst movie ever seen. Worst acting too. I cannot imagine a movie worse then this. Nothing to see. No acting at all.T hey (actors) should look for another job. I cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie.I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!The ladies in the movie...perhaps they better stick to XXX.As for the LEADING MAN...what a lead! He better be put on a lead and stay there!|1
Somehow , I really thought that I was going to enjoy this film because I love pictures with mountain climbing and this was just so much fun! After watching the film a little bit back, I found myself really enjoying it a lot and I think I will recommend it to my friends if they like it. For those of you who don't know me you can probably find it on Youtube or here for a few reasons. As you can imagine, I really love pictures with climbing, especially those where there are a number of people climbing it.|0
This movie has some good performances , as others have pointed out , but suffers ( as others have pointed out ) a number of things. There is nothing wrong with this movie and there has been no complaints with it at all. But it is a movie that will always be loved by a large number of people. And it will never get to the main point in the main story: it is also the only film that can make you feel better and feel more comfortable. In the movie you don't have any control over the characters, but the movie's main plot is pretty straightforward.|0
I loved this show. Such talent; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled, after only just beginning. I looked forward to this show all week long. And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One. I would have loved to see who would have won. It just began, and in my opinion,it should not have been canceled. I hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts, and have the opportunity to reach their goals. I voted, and sat waiting for it to come on; never knowing that it was canceled.|1
"Personally , I have no problem with the acting , nor the script . I do have a problem with the ending of the line , but what is the problem? A:

As far as I am aware, you're not asking if it's OK for a script to terminate, you're asking whether you expect it to work as intended, which is in no way a question of whether it should work. When you say that it doesn't work as intended, it's simply saying ""if you think that would be OK, then so are you""."|0
i love this show. i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the season starts again!! i have followed this show since its pilot then all the way threw from where rusty starts college and see's Casey his sister to now where he's dating Dana.. love this show cant wait until Monday night!! Also i am so glad that cappie and Casey finally got back together that was driving me crazy!!! As for Evan and rebecca i hope they get back together which it just feels like they will by the finale.|1
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly.|1
"Something not-so-great. ""Silence of the Lambs"" remains Demme's only good film, and I'm of course including all the overrated, left-wing exercises in big-screen indulgence some of which I haven't seen - and never will.This is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half-way. The first half is a little hard to sit through; it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays an over-the-top dumb-as-dirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief. His animated acting is often annoying, and barely funny."|1
I am very open minded. I watch all kinds of programs to the end...good or bad...just to give them a chance and learn from the good aspects and bad ones. This show had potential to be good. But my god, what were the writers, casting director, and director thinking? The cast of actors are terrible...with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) being given occasional good lines with the best execution of the lot.The rest of the cast kill the show. It is the same story line in every episode.|1
This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old. Robert Sacchi nails it as Bogie and Michelle Phillips is a truly timeless beauty as Gena Anastas. However, the most noteworthy portion of this film involves the longest belly dancing scene ever produced in a Hollywood film. One well-known professional instructor commented that nothing else in cinema comes close for dance excitement. The scene, which ends up being an important part of the plot, occurs in a lushly beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is by all accounts mesmerizing.|1
it 's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams but it is not. So I think there is a good reason why so many of these people don’t bother to upload to their own site. It is so easy to upload to a site like this. If you only upload one video per person then the upload speed is limited but you can upload videos per person on average once for a few seconds or even an hour but it is not possible anymore.|0
I cannot understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company,but such is the unfortunate obscurity of this Peter Sellers classic(Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide continues to grant it the same BOMB review they gave it in the 1970's).With so many scene stealers on display,Sellers comes through with what may perhaps be his most hilarious role.It all begins with his discovery of a patient who expired at 11:15AM,but Sellers argues that the corpse is still living due to the fact that the new day doesn't start until noon!|1
Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours . The only thing that saves this film is the fact that you can watch a couple of the episodes. I have to confess that I am a little shocked that you did not make the cut of this film and the reason is because if you wanted to watch any of the episodes of this film I would have done it too. You could have made it about as short of five minutes as you would if you didn’t think that there were any.|0
I ca n't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic . I 'm a million miles from the reality that we have now. So it 's my own fault that I wasn 't writing this, I just wanted to have my own opinions. So if you have any sense that it is your fault I want your opinions on the article. If you have any sense, what would be the best way to approach this issue? What should I tell you about it and give you a brief summary of my reasons for writing this article .|0
This is one of the best films I 've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, which makes the whole thing even more exciting and interesting. The cinematography, especially the colouring, is fantastic. The film opens up with a great scene between Belmonndo and the protagonist of one of the main characters. As you might have figured it out, this is the scene we have to look at when Belmonndo goes into combat. The first thing to do is to look at the scene, as you might have guessed it. We have to turn it in the right way.|0
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires . What does one do with desire in a situation like that of a woman? You see, that is the only way to live, even in the worst-case scenario. You have no idea how many people in a situation like that would have the same response if the person you are dealing with would have a completely different response if he or she actually wanted to achieve something, or if they do not have the resources to do that, and are forced to take the steps necessary to get in shape.|0
Dr. Marnie Bannister ( Magda Konopka ) is a horribly disfigured woman . When one of her colleagues discovers a small, dead body , she decides to turn on her husband and takes him into her house with him . As her husband moves from her bedroom to another room which has the same contents as his body . Then the husband kills her husband . She goes into the bathroom , where her husband is still there . She starts to eat with him . After the meal her husband turns to her to eat with her husband . Then the wife's husband moves from the bedroom in the next room and she kills him .|0
This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen . I 've spent four years at the University of Florida studying these two films to try to evaluate my views on them . Film I 've spent my entire life reading, talking, seeing and writing on these films to try to understand . A film that has been studied for so long, it 's hard to think of a better way to 'tuck it in so that you don't get stuck. I hope I'm wrong! This is the kind of film I have been thinking about for the past 3 years.|0
It's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir. There just isn't a lot to say about it. It is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a considerable amount of noirs.Paul Henreid plays a tough guy in here. He's not one I would think of to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. He's a fine actor, anyway.Everything, including the cinematography, is okay-but-not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. That was a surprise.|1
Given Christopher Nolan 's string of successful films , it 's a no brainer for me to want to check this out. The first film I know of that does not exist, nor does it even have a name . . . If I'm going to do it, why not just do it, and see if you can find something you really like? I would do this. You know what would make it perfect? If I wanted this film, that would be it. And I would take it seriously. I'd love to see it finished.|0
In terms of historical accuracy , this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen . The list is incomplete but it is worth reading . It tells us all the things that happened that were happening, and in a very short time it was clear that the Roman Empire had been driven out of the country. I am so glad it is being used for the real thing . If anyone can help me learn what I need to know . It is just what I want to know . It is my understanding that history is being used for a real-world story , and if anything is going to be done .|0
"Dick and Jane Harper ( Jim Carrey , Téa Leoni ) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation is hit by Hurricane Irma. In a statement to his mother, she said, “We’re working to get back to work and we’re still at a loss. We’ve been working all day, and now we have to come back and help our kids out.”

Harper said he was going back to Florida to see her for a couple days before arriving at work and she gave him $18,000."|0
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious . The basic story is about Kintaro Oe who was arrested on the street for shoplifting and now he’s facing a $100 fine? Wow. They’re right. He’s not going to sit in jail but he’s got some real life friends to help out in the process. I’m glad that he went to prison for shoplifting but that would be a total waste of time as he’s facing an actual fine. But hey, don’t worry, he’s not out.|0
Once again Bronson 's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which ( uncut ) is far superior in quality of production to the '80-'90's. If you are looking for a thriller that can't win, Bronson is your guy. However, that's not to say that this is not something that can work for you. While there are plenty of stories and characters that you can get into with the price of admission you need to see that every movie, every book, and every video has a few interesting details.|0
Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austen 's works has been portrayed . Perhaps the most beautiful thing about that piece was that it shows the beauty of the character. It's just a beautiful piece. This piece is one of the best bits of Jane Austen's work to date. It is just gorgeous. It's just a beautiful piece that I'm really excited about, but I have been having a lot of mixed reactions to that piece. It's gorgeous! It's just so pretty. I love the way Austen uses it.|0
The concept : show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the Fairfax District of L.A. preparing for the family get-together. The first house is currently located near Fairfax Elementary School, with three other houses located at other schools. There is one more house, and we will be looking for a third house to be used in the family before the family gets into a big family. The second house is located at the Fairfax Junior High School, with just one house, and one room is used as a study space. The other two houses are currently located at the Fairfax Student Union.|0
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind . One knows it 's only one or two scenes from a movie that 's just one or a few. I think that was one of the things I had come up with for myself and that was that I was thinking about something and I was thinking about something and I thought about something and all of a sudden I think ‘this is it’ or ‘this is the movie’ or ‘this is where I see it. I think that is the movie where I just want it to be.|0
Firstly , let me make it clear that I love aircraft , and usually any film with them in is a film of the same thing, that is , and I am not looking forward to watching it with anyone. The only way I can get any film like this to the screen is by watching it as an example. I would love to see it in some film, but I think that there is something else i am not seeing that i would like you to see. I would also be happy if it would be some kind of comic book to come up with.|0
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the , very protracted , end ! The very short film was directed by David Lee Roth , and his cinematography was done by Robert Redford . The end of his career was not merely a bad ending for his film , though , it was a very good ending to end the film in the end. It had a really good ending in terms of acting , though it was an odd way to end a film. You could see some scenes in this movie with this character standing at the end of an elevator.|0
Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military . When a terrorist is destroyed by an assassin, and his body is left in the custody of a civilian police officer in the United States , the action of the movie is very different from that of other action films such as Star Wars, Star Citizen, Spider-man, and many others . When the assassin takes the body , which he has killed , it is destroyed but the character remains alive , thus keeping the movie alive . There is also an action movie which has the characters being killed while the actor is running.|0
I just saw this movie and all I can say is , where are the drive in 's these days and i cant believe it all i saw! and it's so great!! It is amazing that he's still in such a bad state so far , I just saw this movie and all i can say is , where are the drive in this time , i really can't believe it all and i really want to see this one again and get a look at them. I can only assume they are going to start filming the last few scenes in the park.|0
This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half . Few of the things I see in a horror movie have to do with horror, just as it is with any other genre, but there's still some. First off, it's pretty good, but I'm not quite sure what it could be in its full potential or even what I can tell you. What I've got to tell you is that as a writer I think that it was the only way to be successful in horror.|0

Not too many people seem to know about this movie . Which is too bad because I think it 's a really nice and good movie in it. If you haven't already, you shouldn't have missed that, I will give it back. It should be a big blockbuster. But if you know about this movie... I had to watch this movie with my mother for the first time this morning. It was a big deal because I didn't have a phone call. She took a picture. I just couldn't see it on the screen.|0
This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following:1. The directer must have had some doubts whether to make a Jackie-Chan-type of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing.|1
Okay they tell you it 's real . They do n't list any screenwriters or directors , but one viewing director is going to think you 'll be in heaven . The director who has had a long career has had a short view of a movie with no screenwriting , but the director who had a long term view is going to have a long view to his film . So what do you do then . And you do the one thing you say you don't do is ask your producer to get your script to you and if you have a long time , you 've had to wait .|0
I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick . The shonky production values are not accurate, as the film contains a lot of violence, although I agree that the production values are not accurate in all cases. I think there is a difference. The first half of the production was filmed at night, which meant there were more people who could hear music during the shooting, which was bad. This is the problem. I mean, I have no clue what it's going to be about. I watched it as a kid.|0
This movie was Flippin Awful....I wanted those hours of my life back. For god's sake, -stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs. Its not worth mentioning the title, but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this. And where do I begin? The dumb A** kids in the movie.....The zero plot or story?...the garden-variety college/frat boy-esquire scenes of towel slapping? Or the VERY bad acted, teen angst innuendo? $$$#@%@!|1
As I looked at this movie once again , I think it belongs among Hitchcock 's greatest films . The story of the couple in London . The romance between them is the story of an English couple living in the same country . One night they go to a private hotel room together . On the way home . They decide not to have sex because they would not have enough money . They realise that they are the people they want to love , that they are looking after the house , that's all . I think what makes Hitchcock's films so popular are the characters and the story.|0
Great book, poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the After School Special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong The very talented Gretchen Mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. Feels like everyone just phoned it in. Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude.|1
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean , the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) , is in the midst of a controversy that has resulted in the loss of a small but important part of his profits in his company . The company has recently been fined €50,000 for failing to properly install the electric cigarette. However, Mahé was arrested and released from jail on bail. In the meantime, his company was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in jail, which he received without a trial and received the same term as that of the former owner of Mahé and his partner.|0
"`` Mr. Bean '' , starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson , was a huge hit during its run in the early '60s. Mr. Bean was originally a member of the Eastman Radio Group, which had become one of the world's largest radio clubs in the 1970s. Originally, he was one of many radio DJs of that era who wanted to record his first radio song. The first song, ""Sailin' It Away"", from the 1970s, followed. The record was released in 1979, and included a number of covers, including ""Sailin'."|0
I watched this movie with big expectations. The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying. The violence was nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - perhaps more), and at no stage was I even feeling uneasy let along frightened. Again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps, has not lived up to its hype.Sure hire this movie, but don't go in with any expectations.|1
At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp , the goody-goody two shows Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough boys' and you can’t really blame them for the lack of an effective cheerleading routine. After watching the first year at Beaverview and I’ll admit that even the cheerleading routine wasn’t working for me, it was a real treat to watch. Nowadays, there are quite a few kids who can do a good job and that’s the problem in Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, it’s just not very effective.|0
Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran, pass away. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall.|1
Going into the movie with the right expectations , I somewhat liked this movie . Like most reviewers who have watched it , I felt that the film’s ending was not a bad moment for the actress , but I was disappointed with how it ended . I loved the ending , even if I disliked how the movie had been written . Even though it was good , it was still one of the best endings I saw in movies. I loved how the ending of this movie ended a couple of seconds after the main character fell from the sky .|0
This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fights. (To the extent she may have a double doing the action, it's hard to tell...but Peters herself obviously is doing a good deal of it, and doing it well.) ++++ With a good and serious script, this could have been an excellent film. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining however. ++++ Not up to a regular Jacques Tournier film, but definitely above a regular Jean Peters film.|1
The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate ( i.e . ground , air , personnel ), but it has to be told right now, and in some cases that should make it all worth it. It has to be told all right, right now, right now, when it comes to the military and Marines. And it has to be stated, right now, when it comes to Marines that's right now, right now, and when it's wrong. So what's all this about?|0
On the positive , I 'll say it 's pretty enough to be watchable . On the negative , it's also pretty hard to 'replay it . If you 're watching the movie , it should probably be easy , though you might be doing it a lot wrong . This was a little bit easier than I thought. The video shows you're not actually watching it, though you can watch it a lot . It's like watching a film or video . It has the same set of effects that you get out of watching the movie .|0
"This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland , who died of cancer in 1990 after four months of surgery on her right colon. The film was based on the novel about an ex-husband of the author. Her name was Jill Ireland – Jill Ireland. In it she wrote the text, which was adapted from the story of the life of Dr. David B. Brown. Her final work, the short story was entitled ""Gloria, The Nightingale"". This story is a fictional account of her life. She was born on November 22, 1919."|0
If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one. I wasted enough time myself watching it, so I will waste no more explaining why it is so awful. Be warned!!! Oh, I see that I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground, that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit. The Cavern is one of those.|1
i love this show . i hate when it goes to season finale because it feels like forever until the second movie is finished and we start off with the final episode. And i like that when it goes to season finale , it is not really a season finale as the first season finale was only three weeks earlier and the second one was three months after the first season finale was announced. Also, i can't imagine what a season is like in real life. So in reality i can't even imagine watching a show like this.|0
"Interesting cartoon, included on the DVD of ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"". I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it! )I do wonder, however, how a certain... um, finger gesture... ever got past the censors. Granted, the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed, though--especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question!"|1
"It seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes , trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more. If nothing is in the way, then nothing that could possibly be right is in it for the time being, for now it's as if you just said it all down the river, you know. And you can say, ""I'm right here"" and I know it, but you don't know what your answer is. It is not what you have to say. You want it to be right or right to say something different."|0
Another Son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's horrible. The acting is not too good either. But there is something about it that makes you want to watch more (sort of like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything. If you are looking for a scare...this ain't the flick for you. It's very obscure and nearly impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while, it was titled HOSTAGE.|1
Rififi , directed by Jules Dassin , is in line with the Melville crime pictures ( particularly Bob le Flameur ) that we can find in the film and is also similar to the one seen in the film , but it is more closely aligned with what you will see as part of the film . As with all the films in this section, you will find a section of this film to show the main characters and their relationship between the characters in the film. I would like to thank all of you for coming along with me on a visit to my office today .|0
"Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said it best ""If Walt Disney had hailed from Texas, he would have made Grand Champion"" The movie does not have the video and special effects but it has heart and soul. The kids are great and the array of stars is incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud to be in a movie that their kids can actually see:) (G rated) This is a masterfully crafted ""simple"" little film made in Texas by Texas Barry Tubb."|1
"This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life . A woman `` The Last Man  
and The Last Girl  
for whom I love nothing but her. (19-06-09)   
There was no place for this woman in a film like this. And this is no  
storybook. She was in the right place. It made me want to find  
something else she could be doing, and I wanted to be that person  
or something more. This was the hardest thing I have ever done  
with a woman. I love her."|0
I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film. What was John Landis thinking?I know it's based on a series of children's books, but c'mon! Even kids hate this movie. It's pointless and boring. Tom Arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money.I think the only reason The Stupids hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage. At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K.|1
I enjoyed it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think), delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch.|1
"One of Chaplin's longest films up to that point, Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then ""Prosper Merimee's"" well-known story about ""Carmen."" I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw, since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer, and from what I've read, those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes."|1
What bird is that ? A maltese falcon . The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines' words, which may be one of the reasons Caines' name has come into being. In the film, Caines' character, Alvarado, is about to take a job as a mechanic in the town of Chamonix in the Philippines. In a bid to take the town back from the Spanish authorities, he has been called on to fight a Spanish-language match to get the Spanish version of his story, with which he will have to work with the Spanish authorities.|0
This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth . Yet , you could argue that this story was true for a couple of years, and now it is for a whole other story . You can read here about some of this in my blog. So if you want to read this story about my father-in-law , in the first part of the story , you could go to that link in the blog , where the author says that I could read that story right here , which is a good way to see the author.|0
Unlike one of the reviewers below, I don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. Whereas it is good to see a British director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, AKA's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. At first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex.|1
I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here. but I really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read claimed. It was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic. but, the movie was a let down. specially for neone who has seen 'gadar'. inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs, I must say gadar is the better of the two. the story being virtually the same. partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact.|1
When I first saw this movie, I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset, being directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and utterly changed my mind. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector(masterfully played by Elijah Wood)who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in WWII. He travels to Germany and enlists in the help of a 20-something, club hitting translator and his grandfather.|1
It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all I'm interested in is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys.|1
"Ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. This movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. Steve's rendition of a dying cat during his ""I love what I know"" serenade had me vomiting for hours. Bike chick Linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! Fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying. ""You messin' wit private stock."""|1
"This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers ""San Pedro Beach Bums"".My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a ""walk"". The end result was straight out of Monty Python's ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough.And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...)."|1
"""No one really knows how the Power came to be. Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its beginning, but those who mastered it have always been hunted The families of Ipswich formed a Covenant of Silence bla bla bla"" After this intro, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, perhaps? Well, I don't know which of these they belong to, but one thing's for sure: the descendants of Salem are a boy-band. Can you tell them apart? I couldn't."|1
The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly jumbled here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keypads, laughing heads, etc, mingle without purpose. The parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from Getty Images et al, and the heavy-handed digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?)|1
I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life , and each time I watch it the first time I read a story, then after watching the movie I start to like it a bit more and try to think of a few things to read about a little bit more about what is in it. Some of the scenes are more than 30-30 minutes of the story that I am in, but the main reason for that in this movie is that I love to think about what others have in common with them :).|0
"Honestly , this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting ( Heather Graham could never be that cool). The actors in the film look like they are the same actor that made the movie 'Killer' in the movie ""Killer""! I have to admit this is funny, though, and if you don't like a movie like that, don't tell me, it's probably not the right time to film a scene in it. If it is good, I don't want to watch that movie...I do."|0
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well. Compared to these other films, this is a rather average to poor film. The plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which I cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. The music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, at times, are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! On top of these complaints, the ending of the movie completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture.|1
"This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet, Mishima. It jumps around through his past, through his last day, and through some of his stories but is expertly constructed as it moves from section to section. It captures the flavor of the man, his work and of his times...the difficult 1960s.I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works. The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective."|1
Well , this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version. I’d been waiting for you to come to the premiere this year and I have to say, I’ve just been looking forward to it, which is fantastic! I’m so happy that you were able to get it, I just really need it. You can check out the trailers below and also check out a couple of reviews I reviewed last weekend. And I hope you enjoyed it, I think it will be pretty good.|0
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows. What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along.|1
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love seemed to be the only way to save them. And they were. And what about the people who didn't know this about it? Well, you guessed it. Who knows? Maybe I just wasn't that bad about them. That wasn't even that, was it. If you were a Christian, maybe you didn't remember much about them. It was just a memory. That was what the Bible said. That was the point.|0
Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in `` Beware , My Lovely , '' and that's the whole point of it all. There is no mystery about her life story. The only mystery we are ever going to hear is her love affair with Robert Ryan at the end of her first adventure. This is her life story. If you have ever loved someone in a relationship you have ever loved, then you are probably not a stranger in a love story. There's only one thing to understand about the story.|0
"I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary. One reviewer on Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) got it right right when he wrote, ""From A to Zzzzzzzzz."" The story is about an English colonialist jerk that comes to Malaysia to ""civilize the savages"" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malaysian prostitute fluent in English that services Englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for ... well the movie never really makes that clear, but I can only assume he gives her money or something."|1
Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS , and all my friends and I thought it was a really well-produced video game. I was really surprised. Now it is in its 4th collection. And then I really liked it. So, I am glad I made it. And now I will go and play a game and see if it works out for you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much and I think that you are a great game. And I hope to share it with others when I see you play it, too.|0
Who really wants to see that ? Disgusting violence , disgusting sex , for such a long time . I don't mean to insult you , but as you know , a few years ago I went to see a prostitute, but she didn't know how to tell me to stop, and I wasn't looking forward to her going. That is why it is good to see a man that is in need, he has the skills , the intelligence , the experience, the courage, the determination, and the ability to fight off the evil.|0
Once upon a time , way back in the 1940 's , there lived an actress named Veronica Lake . She was a member of the Chicago Opera family , which was in the early 20th century . She was known to have starred as Mrs. Siegel on Broadway. In the 1940 's, a number of the Hollywood stars went on to the big screen . One such star was actress-in-law Donna Reed . Donna Reed was the first person in Hollywood not to be the first person to star in the role. It was her first role in the film The Big Show .|0
Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down. His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced, but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry touch was lost. The loss of lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work. The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons, an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves 'The Companions'.|1
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man. Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out. Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent. Very little music or anything to speak of. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.|1
It's schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella's younger sister complete with wicked mother, sister, and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy.The cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. The movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout.|1
This really is by far the worst movie I 've ever seen in my whole life ( I 'm approaching 20). It has all of this and many more, the more it looks like the movie that's being made. This movie is probably the closest I've ever seen. This film has all of that, and has some of those great characters. I just don't enjoy it in its entirety. But I have not been able to get to it, or even have time to look over what was made, that's the end.|0
Well I'm not the world's biggest Sondheim fan, so although I have the cast album and I've listened to it a few times I've never actually seen this show performed and I haven't seen the Tim Burton movie version either. I felt like I wanted to see something more faithful before I see the Burton one and give it a chance just as a movie. This version isn't a movie at all, it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast, including most importantly Angela Lansbury's performance as Nellie Lovett.|1
That is what this movie is. Good God the special effects suck in this movie. It is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. Let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks.|1
As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks were committing, I had no reason to think they were committed to this sort of thing, no matter what I tried to do. In fact, I had the same feeling after reading about them in the paper as I did then, and I don't remember much more about them, but it's hard to know what I was saying. They weren't the kind of people to commit to any sort of conspiracy.|0
Not really all that much to this movie ... either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a ton of choices. You'd think that would be the main reason that a stock car racer would have a ton of options in the first movie. However, I think this is an over-used phrase, as they could only have a few different choices in the second movie. So I'll show you the rest of what I did. I'd also like to show you the first 3 of the characters and how they are built.|0
This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM . We had never seen the film , even though we have seen it in a few years time and had never seen this movie , even though we are at the beginning of an age when we have seen movies like this so many times , we have seen movies about Christmas gifts , they are the only thing to give to Christmas gifts to Christmas , so when we got this , we were very excited . I was very excited that it came out that it was a very popular movie , and we were so excited that we were able to enjoy it .|0
One should not be too critical about the director 's second feature.I really like the camera work of Madiba . Its the perfect camera to make a film camera.I've seen it on TV but i don't like its camera work . Its not even the best camera but its good camera.It's a great camera and a good way to do something great with a camera . The best way to film in the world is to bring your camera to the next scene, and shoot the next scene, and make the next scene happen.|0
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work. It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work.|1
It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look on the back of the camera. In this version, the story focuses on a young girl with three children living in the jungle. She gets to know a group of friends who have been there for two years, and the children are trying to figure out what to do about it, as well as some of the more interesting topics, like what is happening in their school and what is going on on the farm, and how do they take it all together.|0
Found this film for one dollar ( $ 1.00 ) and the film was a complete waste of time . I hope that this film will make a strong impact in the art form. But it was not enough. I'm just glad they were able to take the time and resources to make this film. I hope you guys will be so impressed with this film. I hope you will be all the more excited about this film. If you haven't seen it in a long time you are in luck. And I'll tell you, it's great.|0
Historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said , customs can never be made up and there are always a few mistakes we've been able to forget about. If we want to think that all the time, we just can't remember that it is all there is. But we have a lot of it -- so much that we can't forget about it. (And that's when we do forget about it.) There are a few ways to make a good film that can get to the next level.|0
"Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ""The Origin of Species"", so it's fitting that Jon Amiel's ""Creation"" got released. The movie focuses on the period of Darwin's (Paul Bettany) life while he was writing his famous work, and the mild strain that it put on his family life.I guess that the movie overplayed Darwin's tension with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and his guilt over his deceased daughter Annie, but I still like the thought of Darwin's theory working like a karate chop on religious dogma."|1
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman , I had to see the movie . I enjoyed every minute, I had time to stop and admire the movie , I think that is what made me a fan for a while . I loved every moment of Natalie’s career and I have seen a lot of her work , and that I loved every single minute of her movies , but that is not the reason why I want to see Natalie in a movie . I don’t really think she would win any money for it , and yet I do love her so much .|0
...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. What was the motive? The details of the murders were used, but never explained. I guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. There is no thread to follow. I guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as the vulnerable Vicky.Not much more to say, really.|1
I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker. As I was telling friends during my lunch hour, MirrorMask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Just like the short Moongirl, the film missed its marks. Several times during the movie it made attempts at humor. It sets you up for the laugh. Instead of making you laugh, it leaves you feeling empty. The jokes reminded one of the recent Star Wars films. They weren't funny unless you were five.|1
I'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts, nor am I bothered by the cynical, self-righteous stance the makers of this crap take.What I AM bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if ALL of the episodes were staged. Hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than Oprah: garbage television with zero comma zero appeal. Like daily TV soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot.The premise would have turned out great - if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer.|1
This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of Director Jack Swanstrom. Clearly, Swanstrom is a director that we should look out for in the future. His strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom.This thought-provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action, drama, suspense, and mystery. As with all good films, the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie.|1
This movie is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can either laugh at it or shake your fists in rage.This movie deals with many problems of American history, but with the typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: The main character is one of those I-can-do-it-all-and-you've-got-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-guy. He is so pompous and not to be taken serious at any time. What a horrid creature! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the movie and a still very weepy, but stronger character in the end. Too bad she still forgives his cocky ways after he's left her for the second time.|1
"This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition. All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values. This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front. It is easy to see why ""Fire"" has caused riots in India, but tragic nonetheless. A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world, not just privileged westerners."|1
"I mean , nothing happens , 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana ...

Why would we care if it turns out that the marijuana that has been sitting around is still on the shelves and waiting to go on sale? I have a very specific reason for why we should care

Why is the marijuana we have been waiting to sell on the streets of Oklahoma is the kind of drug that can be dangerous and hard to get. We are in the middle of a serious situation that we want to create for ourselves and for others, not just us."|0
"I saw Heaven's Gate on its opening week nearly twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance based on the great anticipation of seeing Cimino's long in the making follow up to his 1978 masterpiece ""The Deerhunter."" The reviews came in and critics trashed the film with vehemence. An influential New York film critic led the way and most critics followed suit, and the 3hr. 40-min. film was pulled from distribution. United Artists had Cimino shorten the film by about an hour and it was re-released many months later to equally horrible reviews and to dismal business."|1
"For reasons I can not begin to fathom , Dr. Lorenzo Cameron ( George Zucco ) begins injecting wolf 's blood into his chest. It turns out the blood is not from the wolf's blood-rich liver , it is from his blood-cheated gut. It is from the blood-cheated blood of Dr. Cameron's body. Cameron's brother, Dr. Zucco , has never seen a human being live so fast in his brain. Dr. Cameron uses his brain to inject a ""wolf"" into his brain . He injects it into his heart. He injects it into his lungs."|0
"I've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004, when I stumbled onto ""Cidade de Deus / City of God"". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or BETTER than ""City of God"".The acting, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. I have not been to Brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality that is beset before the citizens of São Paulo.I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit despondent after watching it.Something you want to watch, but nothing you want to go to sleep on."|1
Slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire , and , all the way out to the sea, with lots of time to go in my day! I'm really excited to be back! The story has been going on for years, it's the story of an adult, and I've wanted it to be something I can enjoy, but I'm still not sure how, I thought it would be. I was thinking of what a good movie I'm doing, and thought it would have some fun characters.|0
Monday , October 02 , 2006 So I got together with my dad as I always do .

The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film , only adds a new layer. The film has been hailed as a great milestone of Ramos Silva's career, both in Europe and in the US and it was also the first to be shot in Spain. The film has been described as one of the greatest in a long time and was shot in Madrid, which is the biggest town in Spain and it is an incredibly beautiful town and I would never be able to get in the same place again.|0
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail.|1
I usually don't categorize a moving as boring. I am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. Unfortunately, this movie has none of those characteristics. Diane Lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it. Terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting. None of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience.|1
"Who really wants to see that? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for such a long time. I do not want to, but I always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be. This was the hardest (right after ""Next Friday"").It's basically just crap. How can you possibly call it anything else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T&A. Yeah, yeah, ""Hey, it's realistic, they have been like this."" Fine, but why bother us with it?"|1
`` Graduation Day '' is a result of the success of `` Friday the 13th . '' Both of those events, in the case of a Friday the 13th , have already been completed. On Friday the 13th (or Sunday the 14th or Sunday, depending on which event you're referring to), you may be asked to submit an application to the U.S. Department of State or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or U.S. Customs Service. If the application is approved by a local agency, this is a great opportunity for you, the applicants to apply to U.S.|0
A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent ' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana , a member of the royal family of England. As part of his quest to find and destroy the missing heiress's ship, he has been able to find her and retrieve the body of her father . Diana has been abducted and killed by a woman who believes that she is a woman. She can only be seen and heard with her husband and daughter. A search for the missing heiress revealed that her family was murdered and her body is missing.|0
I totally agree . This is `` Pitch Black underground '' and a well worn plot . The best scenes of all these episodes were shot with black and white shots. This is also a good movie to view on its own. I like the movie so far so much that I'm going to buy it now and then buy it again until I feel like this movie is the best. I love the first few episodes and this movie is by far the best episode I saw in my first day of school so far.|0
You know you 're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you . I 'm okay with that. I try not to be mean. But don't worry, I don't see myself that way at the moment. I'm trying to learn the language, and try to learn to feel good, but that doesn 't matter. I try not to be mean, and do my best, because that is always the way I 'm supposed to do it. I'm not trying to be mean here. You 're just trying to be mean.|0
"This film reeks of production line planning. It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies, and threw spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Baby! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film does address the age of the Stewart/Allyson performers; though, I'm certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger.There are messages in ""Strategic Air Command"" I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I'll stick with one truly wretched element: The happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character makes an important decision without consulting his wife."|1
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters' actions. All films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesn't have it - the story doesn't make any sense. To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film.|1
"Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call ""humor"". That this movie, and Moore's other prevarications, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time.Let's see if we can bait foreigners. Let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend we're funny. Let's see if we can out-isolationist Charles Lindbergh."|1
I'm a big fan of the demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this one, it looks pretty good! You've got Decapitron, the puppets, and a new villain in THE TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk that's doing this project to animate, inanimate objects, can't act. He stinks! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. THE TOTEM. I'd watch that for 2 hours. But instead, the puppets role is down played, and the whole movie suffered because of it.|1
This movie makes `` Glitter '' look like `` Schindler 's List . '' Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need a new twist on their concept, one that is `` just the opposite of the movie,'' and one that doesn't need to be borrowed from a new, original movie title, such as The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda 3, or Zelda 3. The idea behind the movie is the use of `` Schindler 's List ,'' which makes the movie look like its original title. This film is about a guy who wants to change the world.|0
I watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful ! Awfully long - even though they managed to shoot it so well that you might have seen it again. If you liked it, or have been following this site for any time in the past couple of weeks (or maybe even a couple of weeks) let me know - I'd love a copy of it for anyone to download. If you have the time - please feel free to post it on the internet or you can also send me a question about the DVD or any other DVD I've received.|0

Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots, the times Jacqueline rubs herself, the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains, this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end.Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples, this one takes awhile to guzzle. The performing is good.|1
This movie was alright. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters (sorry for stating the obvious) who against their will are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that.Right away two French boys (who looked slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. Blah blah blah. It's an Olsen twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. Anyway, along with that, the twins meet a FABULOUS French model because they're in Paris, the fashion capital of the world.|1
Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater. Even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film.Unlike most HK actioners, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. When they do happen, they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. The dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the of Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, and a roll-call of HK's top acting talent chewing up the scenery.|1
Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie -- who woulda thought ? I sat through two previous films Estevez directed a great movie. One of them, I've never seen more than half of them. The second one, I was a big fan of it. So I decided to do a little research, and discovered a good film that made a great movie to watch. I decided that the only reason why it wasn't perfect, was that no one would believe it. So I turned it to a test film, and it turned out to be a great one.|0
I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew who was 17 to watch the same with me. I am 35 and he is 17. He liked it and I did too. It still is funny, a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment. Satish Shah is hilarious in multiple roles. This sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on TV. But obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today. It would have been nice that Shafi Inamdar would have continued for all the seasons.|1
Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen . He could effortlessly switch from a serious romantic to a romantic melodrama without straying far enough from the character, and with so few of his actors to work with, he couldn't afford to do that. But the fact was that he made films in the film industry almost as much as he made television. And what made it even more so was that when he started out he was one of the very few actors from Hollywood that didn't know what to do with a movie.|0
This movie is absolutely horrible ! I thought because it had good actors in it like Gabrielle Union , Hill, I couldn't have seen it in the movies when I played the characters and I didn't have enough actors. But I think they made enough actors in it. This is what you should see in movies in general. It is horrible. It's like in the movies, if someone tries to sell you to them, they'll buy you out. You should not see that in the movie, because it's awful. This is the worst movie.|0
I should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $6 would be bad. I even read the reviews before watching this film, and that still didn't sway me. I loved the book, and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said.Yeah, it is.A patchwork of film, video, and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the time period covered was one chapter, but I don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book.|1
I have viewed this cartoon as a child, a father, and now a grand-father. It is my favorite cartoon. I love the characters, the great little tunes, and the very good drawings. I totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon. I think it is a beautiful little cartoon. Everyone I have shown it to simply loves it. It is too bad it opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombing). If it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success.|1
I loved the film `` Eddie Monroe '' . The film had all the components that kept me interested while it was happening to my family and I thought, `` If he dies I'll take it away from you.'' That's how my dad was when he made that film, and that was just how he acted. I wanted to be a part of it and have a part in it when I married. He was a wonderful father and husband, and I thought about how he used to get on the bus and talk with other people and get to know the family and my family.|0
A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be?|1
You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting , but it 's far from what they want to talk about. There are many reasons for that, for one thing. They don't want to talk about normal people, or about anything about them, which is their life and their career, or anything they would be comfortable with. There's no way they want to do that. If they wanted to talk, or talk about them, then they've got to have someone else.|0
"Formulaic to the max. Neither title reflects the serial's actual content, ""Fighting Nazis in Morocco,"" (actually, the Iverson ranch). The plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. The packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. That's at least three a chapter! Aside from seeing Duncan Renaldo cast as a Spanish accented Frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. When the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too."|1
I do n't care what anyone says , this movie is hilarious ! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads 3D with its darkly realistic atmosphere. It makes you feel like you just stepped out of the woods. It's also fun when you play a movie that you just bought, but never played or saw again. You can't help but enjoy the movie. I'll be posting more movies later! If you'd like to see more of the same movie, please head over and click on 'Continue Reading'. There's also a button in the left hand corner of the screen.|0
_The Wild Life_ has an obvious resemblance to _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_ , and _The Wild Life_ comes up short in its ability to produce an entertaining narrative that offers a sense of nostalgia for the period when they first met. However, there are plenty of similarities between _Fast Times At Ridgemont High_ and _The Wild Life_. For example, the film begins with the title sequence in which you and a young boy are in love while the next scene features the characters going to school. You also see a scene in which you are at the wedding of a junior high school girl and an attractive young boy.|0
In a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950 's . Leon , the leader of a gang war who wants to bring down everyone in his life. In the end, it all turns into a nightmare of a nightmare . The plot of the film is that his gang is going after someone who is actually a threat. He doesn't even realize that his friend has been killed by the group after he tries to escape from his life. And when the group starts attacking, they have to get him out of his life .|0
I just viewed Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled to a surprise ending. Heartwarming performances, action, humor, and drama filled the screen. Topnotch acting by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film that Fred Carpenter has made to date, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe this is a low budget, independent film. Just imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood level budget.|1
This movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship . Not ONE review described any of the characters as asexual or homosexual, as is the case in the movie. This movie is one of my all time favorites. I loved it. I didn't want to make a movie with such a simple premise. I wanted to use that as an opportunity to explain the whole plot, but I thought it would be a good example of a story, and I wanted to do it as a gay romance.|0
A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides. Then again, are these really suicides? It seems as though there's a ghost on the loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that hides its face, and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that, making for a very weird looking specter. Recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects--which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped--always accompany this hapless spirit.|1
So keira knightly is in it...So automatically we compare this film to attonement. Aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.The Actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.If you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physche's damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.This film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath.|1
I started to watch this show by accident , but I love it . The fact that main character is from India is interesting . I love this show , but I don't know why . It is just because I can't see myself in it , and there is no place for this in the show . I am glad to hear you all are reading the book . It is a good book , it is really very readable , I can't find any better one , but I don't like it . I would like to know the reason that you think the characters are very different .|0
Watching the first few moments , you realize it 's going to be a parody - and certainly it *should* be - it's really a comedy for the audience, in that you really have to go out of your way to get the laughs out. (And there are lots of laugh out loud jokes out there, which you should try to get some time for that.) I've seen it before, but I thought it would be funny. I was going to just be a parody of one of these things and it worked out fine.|0
The title , although singular , will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of Tod Browning 's immortal classic about a dead man. This tale was well written and detailed, and is a must read for anyone who is looking to see what we can expect from Browning. At a minimum, please review the novel and the novel's synopsis, and read through it carefully. You may find that you enjoy Browning's books, but you should be ready to do some reading if you are interested in the novel. The book will be released in paperback in October.|0
I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst project I’ve ever done in my class. I was going to do this a few weeks ago and came up with the following post. I thought this post was totally unnecessary and I thought, “wow. I had to do it!” Maybe I was trying too hard. Anyway, it turned out there was more to do than what was already here. This was my second project with a bunch of people and this is where I thought I would take it.|0
There is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of incidents since the end of the 1960s. The most recent example of such a disaster was in New Zealand when two men died on the spot after the first attack. It could be that the perpetrators, who are known as “fraudsters,” did not know the circumstances and that the attack was a hoax because the culprits made no attempt to hide the truth. The perpetrators’ motives are still debatable, as is this article, which is largely taken up with the media in the United Kingdom.|0
This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to get a chance to watch a few episodes of the series. This time around I’m a grown man who lives in California, but that doesn’t mean I can get an opportunity to watch as much as possible before I get into the habit of giving my children a little break-in. But for the most part, I love that one episode of the movie that I’ll be reviewing on my own.|0
"Let's face it, a truly awful movie, no...I mean a ""truly"" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. I admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Half Caste, Species, etc. And although I'm giving this film a 1, I highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: Aussie Park Boyz."|1

As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick And Jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in. The idea that a charming, charismatic, top V.I.P employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible.|1
"The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner' that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' and had me at ""My Maisonette"". Hope it keeps up the good work of 'faux terribles' on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of ""alternative comedy""(I hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one.) comedians on TV today.I'm glad that on a trip of local DVD retailers today ""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" was sold out across the board."|1
This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics . Sure , it 's fluff , it 's not ``like'' Christmas , it 's ''like'' music, but it ''doesn't'' like it, it ''doesn't'' it ''do '' it'' it'' but it ''doesn'' it ''do '' the ''it'' ''it'' it''. It ''does''. ''Do''. ''I'' ''do''. ''When''. ''If''. ''When''. ''When''. ''Where''. ''I''. ''Did''.|0
Okay, anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film. A sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) whoring himself out for a buck. Mr. Cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in the throes of alcoholism, but why did Cotten do this mess?|1
I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was coming and I wanted to be there in a few days. But I didn’t. It took me some time to realize there was something wrong when I saw it first and I needed to be in the right place to find it. But I figured I would find out the hard way that there was a problem with that movie. And I did, so that is how it went. The second movie that the studio sent to me was the follow up of the original.|0
"Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there.Let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. I too, had liked Russell and Pare ""back in the old days"" and was very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review, I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I did return to the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded."|1
this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline... a lot of gore but without meaning and the majority of time without originality. the movie is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some demon but nothing link up seriously the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie...but it isn't Pinhead, he is just a boring bad guy who kidnap kids and kill bird, and the worse...he talk too much.|1
So , Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time , this time replacing the interesting characters of the anime. Wynorski: I love the series, but I never understood how it could work like this and what would it have been like to do. It just made it feel like a work of art. We know what you’ve been working towards, but I can’t think of anything to say that has ever happened. What I really enjoyed about Curse was how it turned the focus back on the characters that were created. You just have to enjoy that and enjoy it.|0
Although I was hoping that I 'd like it a little more , this was still certainly an impressive film. I do not know if I have enjoyed it enough to enjoy it for anything that I can see, and I was hoping to get a bit of a better taste of what it was like in my head when I wrote the script. As with most things I write, it's something that I enjoy, and for some reason I find that I 'd like it a little bit more . The script was originally written for a series of television films, including a television series produced by Warner Bros.|0
If you came here , it 's because you 've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it. So here is one idea: if you 've watched this movie , you're sure it was filmed here . There were other examples where you 've seen the movie and was curious what others may have thought about it . The idea is that it was filmed there and you'd just read it , but you'd never really look at it . It's just that we can 't think of anyone 's thoughts , or even that there was a story that they 've watched .|0
What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and pimps after he had been in prison. This is what we have been talking about on the street, though it would be more accurate to say the brawler’s most famous trait was its self-aggrandising attitude. If Caravaggio were a criminal he wouldn’t have been arrested, though in fact he had been jailed for a decade. But, in the end, we know that as a gangster he had a very strong self-aggrandising streak. He was not the type to be violent.|0
You can take the crook out of the joint, but it seems exceedingly more difficult to take the joint out of the crook. We've seen this kind of character in this kind of situation before (and since): in movies like BOB LE FLAMBEUR, ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI, THE ANDERSON TAPES, etc. Too many times to mention. What helps make this one one of the more notable is (of course) the heist itself, which plays out wordlessly in real time, and the demeanor of the lead.|1
ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford, an author, film director, writer and TV personality. This is a book by the man himself, a man who has spent most of his life in Hollywood.

He had been working at the British Film Institute (BFI), where he started his career as an editorial writer.|0

This is a decent movie . Although little bit short in time for me , it packs a lot of visual elements. The main reason it is so good . . . and I found it very entertaining. . . .

Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies . Lots of people would love to see it. But is there any reason that this would not appeal to children? . . . Well, I've been meaning to do the movie now for the past 5 months, and I thought maybe I would be able to come up with a better way. I've read all these comments on here and thought maybe I should do this one. Well I'm now reading this article which I've just read. So here goes.|0
"Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric, or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Be that as it may, with plenty of careful analyzing, ""Falscher Bekenner"" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum American re-title (""Low Profile"").Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of), admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests."|1
"I ca n't believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess ! The plot ( and I use mine ) had changed since the beginning of the film, and I think I have been able to read his thoughts on it a bit better now :-/ _________________""You have to believe the truth! That's all there is to believe in!"" I don't like the title of this but I have always been skeptical when it comes to people who are interested in what was said on the web and what they thought about the film as it was presented."|0
"When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an ""intelligent person"" is like, they fail so miserably, finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the purported ""genius"".Right, any genius walks around trying to rub in his superiority at every instance. Sure, they hang out in bars and pick fights  it's not like they are (generalizing wildly) autistic nerds who never have a tan.Plus, if you are a genius you know all about Math and History and Politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a thorough analysis of them."|1
"Sorry about that. But if you have seen this ""epic"", you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly the next in line for sainthood, but I do know the basics. And the basics were this. God wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the Earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted ways."|1
This movie was boring . Very much like Underworld , only even less interesting . It 's not much of an actual movie so if you have to wait for a couple of minutes , you won't even have time for it . I have been working on my screenplay for three days . This movie is boring . I'm trying to get the last line on the end, so I don't want to waste that time. It's not a movie in the genre , its a movie , I know what it's about but there isn't really anything in it .|0
Every time I 've seen this movie I get the same impression : some parts of it are so amazingly real-like that I've never seen it. I just wonder if this is how you expect your movies to look. I suppose if you don't want to change the subject just don't worry about it - just take it seriously and try it. As you say, you don't know if you've ever seen a real-life movie. Just look at the actors and costume - and then take a picture. You just don't know if you don't like the scene.|0
All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. You can approach it in one of two ways: (1) A gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, ABC-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. Either way it just don't fly, do it? Why then has it received so much praise?|1
Well, first off, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their boyfriends aren't even French, so that is bad because they are faking the accents. Lamo. It is also not that bad, not their best. I am A big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is OK and it is funny to watch. it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again.|1
"Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan.A pre-""Malcolm in the Middle"" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a deranged guy who eventually hijacks Mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds. It has something to do with his severe head ringing (& possible deadly combustion--his wife just experienced it), and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast. Only Mulder could relate to this guy's plight, and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed."|1
My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait, but ended up getting the chance to see the movie premier at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film which not only depicts the beautiful Texas landscape, but also had a great feel-good storyline. It was well written, directed and produced and my mom and I loved it from start to finish!. Thank you Jay for giving us the opportunity to be a part of the premiere of this wonderful movie. It was a night we will never forget.|1
Monster of Mexico I do agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies , mainly because of the size of the script, the characters , the plot, the cinematography , and the dialogue. It is one of the best films ever made. I don't see why not , but I do , I do , and I love it , though I am not sure if I am actually making this movie as well as the others that have it. I would like to see it if possible . . . But I do think I am making it as hard as possible, especially the first one.|0
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff. One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain, then its safe to surf this beach!Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm, son. Nothing in the world smells like that. Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up.|1
"This is a cult classic for sure! !It is tricky to follow at times, but then again, so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare, then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want "" to view the world differently"" then i would say open yourself up to Enigma's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout."|1
Scarecrow Gone Wild starts as high school teenager Mike ( David Zelina ) & his mates decide to to give him a chance. Now they’ll have to have it back for another two weeks, but Mike and his mates are happy to show up for their chance to play on a game called The Scarecrow Go Wild. You’ll have to be a little careful when playing, however, and it doesn’t sound so scary at all! I’ve been looking forward to having Mike on the cover for about a month now and I’ve finally made the move.|0
Dolemite is awesome. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to becoming a spoof of a genre without actually being spoof. Citizen Kane this may not be nor Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly genius in it's own right. The production values in this movie are so bad they could qualify as existential special effects. The plot drags a little in the middle but the power of such a cheap premise as kung fu hookers is enough to bring all but the snootiest film lovers through.|1
A terrible deception : controversial film , winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003 , Mil nubes de paz turned in. I saw his picture in the first place in a film made in the United States in the 1980s , and I really enjoyed watching it , but for what I did not see , I got bored by it. And it was a bit boring , I was too drunk to care much for it . The story of Mil nubes de paz turned , I thought was good . But this is not a book , I was so tired I just didn't know if I was going to like it .|0
"How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a ' 1 ' ? I thought `` Manos , the Hands and Feet of a Dog are a sign of the strength of our human race ! I wish to ask you a few questions. Would it work if i had a ' 3 ' ? This is the answer :D

How do we know if we have the right answers ? The answer is that it depends on the subject, but if it is the ' 1 ' it is important, if there is nothing on it then it has to be a sign of what the person is asking."|0
"I was looking forward to Dante 's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from Showtime , but this was an odd place to start. The first book was a short story from an anonymous author of the title, and the second one was a series of poems for which he had just published the first edition, one of which had a title of ""I Am the Devil"" on the title page, with a line from ""I am the Devil as a young man"" written on it, as well as a poem on Dante himself, which was about to be published."|0
I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back . It was so bad , I can only guess I didn't watch it . I have been on the television for about 30 min every week , I have only read about the film but I couldn't decide if it was funny or not, but the movie made a bit of impression in my mind , the story was a funny , and the plot was funny . After watching the movie I finally became convinced that it was a really great movie so I did the next movie but the movie didn't work for me .|0
I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.I did some swell pictures for him, one of which I was told became the poster for the movie. I didn't see the film until years later. I thought it was bad. A pity, because the elements that went into it were compelling. Robie Porter's girlfriend was almast as beautiful as Rampling herself. Salter asked if I would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. I said sure, but I had to return to NY, promising I'd be back.|1
And obviously I did n't see it ! But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back, I'd say that it's a good show. I'm sure it will be interesting to watch from the wings. It's just what we need to get this season off to a better start than we have been all year. I'm glad it's been a success! I'm sure it'll be great on television! I think it's the first season of the show and it's been very interesting and a great show for a lot of reasons.|0
It seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing. And this is what it does: it distributes the films that they are looking for on the web. If they don’t want it for young kids it’s just because the films they are looking for don’t exist in their library or on any other website they are using. If they don’t want it for anyone it’s just because the movies they are seeking have not been made yet.|0
"The recent release of ""Mad Dog Morgan"" on Troma DVD is disappointing.This appears to be a censored print for television viewing. Some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. Anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic DVD version. ""Mad Dog Morgan"" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theatrical cut. However, even as released on DVD, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century Australia."|1
Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten andraped in the opening scenes of this made for TV movie, “Merry Christmas.” After she gets out of the car to help the victim in her car, she tries to make a joke about her boyfriend. However, she is caught in the middle of an argument when she’s told she is going to have sex with him. In the final scene of the movie, she tells his mom that she’s just going to do whatever it takes with him.|0
I just watched the DVD of this award winning film. One Life Stand is a stark drama that through it's pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, paints a very compelling and honest picture. It's a story about life's dilemma's around power, sex and control highlighted by a few sad lonely lives. The mother (very well acted by Maureen Carr) is uptight and drawn in on herself. The father only appears on the side-lines, and yet is a powerful and pivotal part of the drama.|1
"Dark and bleak sets, thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife (or razor) a perfect cast lead by Broadway greats Hearn and Lansbury. This is exciting theatre flawlessly transferred to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and Todd is his Masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the darkly humorous Act I finale- ""A Little Priest"" where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims that will wind up in their meat pies , this play never ceases to thrill,excite and satisfy."|1
This is a wonderful family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms, The Thin Blue Line (Better than this) and Blackadder (Not better than this).Mr Bean is a no talking, human disaster. He goes to places and gets himself in absolute mayhem, the mayhem includes: Climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off, taking about 20 minutes, until some kids eventually throw him off, ending up inside a washing machine and driving his car while sat on a roof.|1
I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.I went into this not realizing what it was - and I'm not the only one!I gave this 4 stars out of a possible 10.Now I'm done with this - and I'll just go home.I just have to give this up for the people who don't give up!I don't know what the difference is here, but I will give it a shot and hope that it makes some sense to you.I'll take my shot and go in search of another place.|0
What a dreadful movie . The effects were poor , especially by todays standards , but that was forgivable . I think it would be a lot better to have a great story . But it had to have a good effect . I have never seen a good movie like this , I have no idea what it was . I have not seen that movie before , so if someone has to read the movie I don't know . But I will . . . I will do it . . . I can't believe it . But it was really a good movie .|0
"Perhaps I missed something , but I found GOYA 'S GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama . As to what I was trying to show, the story is all I can think of . I think the first couple of scenes are a little too complex to describe, but I really hope these are all right. I've also had a blast playing with these for ages , I feel I have really gotten this far. I don't think the character has changed a bit , but I hope there are more to this one. Thanks

I will be putting together some pics for those interested in the characters."|0
If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following, then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. We were able to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order.|1
The greatest movie ever.How's that for a contention? However, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time.|1
My parents may enjoy this show , but I fail to find the humor in it . What is so cool is that my husband and I share all our own experiences , and that’s what makes the show good . You know what this means. I don’t want to say too much, but this is something we share, and you can enjoy it as much as I can if you’re new to this show. I can see the humor as part of what makes the show great . If you like it you can share with us your own experience of what we do.|0
this movie is n't that great ... at all but it 's good when you want to just laugh , when you really need to do it and it's the way that I know you will get to it , I can do it 's much better but you know you'll get to it 's too, I don't know what you're thinking , I'd do 's very well but then you'll see I don't 'll be the one to make it so I 'll be as good as that 's going to be if you 'll understand what I 'm trying to say .|0
"I think ""Rosemary's Baby"" is the most overrated horror film out there. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It's reasonably well-directed and Ruth Gordon was wonderful but that's about it. But this sequel makes it look like ""Gone With the Wind""!I caught this on TV back when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember Rosemary's baby Andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over (the world that is)."|1
"Look, this film is terrible... the ""plot"" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. Eventually the kids engineer ex-convict Beverly D'Angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? And D'Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny."|1
I have seen this movie and I did not care for this movie anyhow . I would not think about how much I loved this movie. I am not a fan of the movie. I am not a movie fan myself . I am just enjoying the movie and it has a good feeling to me. The film is great. I loved the scenes in the movie. I love this movie. It has a great feel. The actors were great and the director was great. The sound was good. The lighting was great . The acting was great .|0
As a kid , this movie scared me green . As an adult , I could n't stop laughing.I have always hated movies as a kid. But now I know why and I want to know the reason . Because the movie scared me to my core . The movie scared me to my core , I think. I'm so scared to tell the truth . But it scared me . Because the movie scared me scared of my heart . The movie scared me to my heart . The movie scared me to the heart , I want to know the reason .|0
S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago , Jr. (1887-1949) who is the founder of Ruben Santiago Museum in San Antonio, Texas, as well as in the life story of the famous Ruben Santiago, Jr. (1911-1975). The artist, born in Paris in 1889, and currently living in Chicago, Illinois, he is currently one of the most important artists of his time, in terms of his career. Nanny is a painter and sculptor who is among the very best known artists in the United States for their work.|0
New rule. Nobody is allowed to make any more Zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original idea.Sadly, this movie doesn't. They have the premise that Bounty hunters go out and kill Zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers. Well, problems with that. Most people have ten fingers, why not just collect ten bounties for one Zombie? Why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a Zombie finger? Not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action rifle.I sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and FX guys.|1
Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film `` experts . '' In the beginning the movie is in the very early stages. But then in the next few months the film starts to get bad. In fact it is very bad in the beginning of the film. But in the very early stages the film starts to do better. We have no proof that this movie is good but we do have some things that might be good or bad and that we should be looking for. In this case the film is very good but we have no proof to put it down.|0
I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many but I'm gonna put myself under the bus here and say I like 'em, especially Guts of a Beauty (aka Entrails of a Beautiful Woman). Watched it the other night with some folks at the pad and I was surprised how well it actually went over.Entrails is the type of madcap cheapo horror softcore sleaze epic that you really just don't find too much of outside of Asia (specifically Japan in this case).|1
"I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.Let 's make a serial killer movie like Se7en.2.The first half of this story, a murder that occurs in an ordinary city, is the most powerful in our lives, but the killers of the novel are so strong and terrifying that they might as well kill everyone they know. ""This movie is the worst of the two."" This is so much better than what we thought it would be on the last page, but maybe we could get back to how it should be done by the author and how we could write it."|0
"How do I describe the horrors ? ! ! ! First , some points : First , this review should make a point on why this is the way we do it. Then , another point : First , I've been writing the review. But I also think it should be written like this :

1. What does ""this"" mean ? I don't quite understand the meaning of this. The first part of my question is how do I describe ""this""? I have never understood the concept of this by any means."|0
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint. I was reminded so often of other movies, it became a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. One line by itself, is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk.BUT...See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever.|1
So me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up for dinner this Sunday. I just wanted to say this and that is what we're looking for! I'm planning to go on my trip down this road tonight and we're just looking for the perfect rental car. We're on our way to Chicago this evening for our wedding, so I thought we'd make sure you are all ready to get started. We'll make a reservation for one of our favorite movies night.|0
Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry, like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily upset by intense material! The finest performances by Alan Rickman and Madelaine Stowe, without a doubt. This dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for ANY reason, whether they are anarchist's or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone. I saw it when it first came out 1991 and I remember every frame. It still scares the hell out me today.|1
"Under no circumstances watch this film . It is terrible for a number of reasons : No plot No structure . No camera . All they have in common is the title . The only thing I can really say is that I don't find it horrible . It is the best movie ever . However, it does look and sound like nothing I would ever love . If I were watching it again I'd like to say: ""I loved it"". I would say it will probably get worse on its release . I don't believe for a moment that the filmmakers did not have a good story ."|0
I watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears . I guess I have never had this much of a crush on the guy in my family . If you are in love with the person in the movie, then this is the movie for you and not for everyone . You can follow him on his Twitter account . I think it is so cool that you can even read about him and his family . You may want to check out his blog . I haven't read about him for a couple of years and I hope that you like him .|0
go get your camcorder , your little brother , and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on your house !!! ????

For your camera, you need a good camera.|0
I should have realized that any two-video set being sold for only $ 6 would be bad . I even bought the $6 for a camera. And, I also bought a new $1 for the new camera. The price is still too high, and the $1 might not be worth it for most photographers, but I really think the camera will give me the better price when I get a chance. So, I'm not sure I will ever buy again, as it's not something that really matters to me.|0

"I have not seen and heard the original version.I am no Russian, but I am learning right now.I also have no preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, the US etc.But what I have to mention is:In the German synchronisation in the whole film all Russians speak with Russian accent. Americans talk ""Hochdeutsch"" (without accent)! I have never heard such a stupidity! Besides, this is boring.I hope the original is better.The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of a James Bond film."|1
A spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons research. In this article we take a different approach to exploring the possibility of creating a spaceship which is a human-powered robot. We take a very different approach to explore a potential future in a spaceship. We take a human-powered spaceship from space-based spaceflight technology to a human space-based technology. As an example, the spaceship is being designed in a way that the spaceship can be powered by other humans. The human space station is capable of moving around.|0

I was standing right next to it, and I saw some of the most beautiful vampires I have ever seen. . . . And they weren't any more beautiful than vampires. . . . I was so impressed with that. . . . They weren't vampires in disguise, like the others in the movie I saw. They weren't any less vampires than any other guy.|0
"If you're looking for an accurate portrayal of Che Guevara, the Cuban revolutionary who helped aid Fidel Castro in his bid for power, you'd better read up on Cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine (you ARE on the Internet, after all).But whatever you do, DO NOT WATCH ""CHE!"". Unless, of course, you just want a good laugh.All the reviewers of the time (and moviegoers) gave ""Che!"" their vote for worst film of the decade. And no wonder; have you seen this travesty?"|1
I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings, but that isn't saying much.The plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and nobody ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.What then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies.|1
The Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 80's. Unlike most of the Cannon films Charlie starred in, this one wasn't fun or entertaining. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought he was Mr. Emotion before, wait until you see this! In this one, Charlie goes to an unnamed Central American country and shows the populace that whoever messes with Chuck or his people have to pay the piper. This one is no fun.|1
"A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no ""I"" in ""team""!I decided to watch the unrated version for this film. It was thirty minutes longer and I though it may be better than the theatrical release, hearing that people hated this movie."|1
"This has to be the worst movie i've seen this year.. and i watch a lot of cable. The plot is just ridiculous, the scenes are just thrown at you with no action, no start or ending of any scene.. it's just random idiots with make-up that scream in some plane.. The ""special effects"" ( Spielberg would laugh his ass off ) are horrible, the yellow eye contact lenses are cute though.. I have to admin that i couldn't bear to watch it to the end."|1
so if a guy meets you and he says ' I want you to look at my erection ! ' You'd think it was just a muscle, wouldn't you ? You would think that would be what you want when you're the guy to have an orgasm. But you would not know who you met and what you were looking for when you did it. I don't understand how a man can get what he wants when there is nothing more to look at in the world. You can say something like this to your girlfriend if you don't want to see her again and don't like it.|0
"`` Nicodemus '' is almost a copy of `` Red '' in the odd behavior sense , but this episode is more in the same style . Let's now explore why this episode is actually in the odd sense:

  1. It is more of a `red` version. So we'll use it to explain why Red is so strange and what it means in the `red` way. 2. In the `red` sense, this is because we know that the first thing to know when we do this is that Red has no color! 3."|0
Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches, each one of them focussing on a female personal device that was made popular by a single 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the latter half of 1998, rather than the early episodes which were all directed by women). From opening statistics that make Rabbit Fever sound like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run amok with women's addiction to solitary pleasure.Men, as Germaine Greer rather arrogantly explains, have invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom.|1
Seymour Cassel gives a great performance , a tour de force . His acting as supposed washed up beach stud is excellent . I have been told that there are many people who are having problems with his behavior, and they seem to think that they have never been on a regular basis in my opinion. I find this to be a little disturbing, because it makes me think about it, but it's just as bad when I have no control over my actions . I don't have the control over my own life . I don't have the control to be a complete fool .|0
A bit too much Mediterrenean machismo for me . The cast was beautiful , lovely to watch in all of its forms. I was very tired and tired of being a kid and of watching the world become something different when my parents were children . The movies are always the best . The movies are always the best I could watch in the evening. It is only when I was in college , I was always in love . When I was in school and I was at an arts college I loved playing with the students . It was a big challenge.|0
A beautiful film. One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed. Made me think about death but not fear it, think about life but not hide from it. A movie that gave both love for all I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell. A movie that made me think of love and all that I have lost, but no sadness graced my eyes, for some strange reason, relief. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a good bit of wine and irony!|1
Age of Steel follows up the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects, lacking in others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important being Tennant's excellent portrayal of the Doctor. Indeed, his sort of daft giddiness bears, to this writer, the shadow of Tom Baker's Doctor, with his sort of subconscious asides (as when ticking off time periods when Mickey is holding down the button in the Tardis), yet brings his own aloof superiority a la McCoy's Doctor as he lets events coalesce around him.|1
"I would not recommend it whatsoever . It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater , or something like it . I don't do theater , it's fine for theater , but not for a movie.

"A fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice new ending. I'm not sure what that meant, but I had to figure it out a couple weeks ago. I think it's probably something along the lines of ""That was supposed to be a really nice movie,"" and I think I'll post about it on the site soon. Here's how it played out:

Okay, this should have been an enjoyable read, but instead, it ended up being a bit more than I'd thought."|0
i love watching the Jericho mile. i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter. i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him. i've watched the Jericho mile 100's of times and will watch it 100's more.|1
I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick , and I 've always been a fan of it. You know what I liked about this movie? Most of the actors are pretty great but I'm not the only one who hates this movie. And there are a lot of people who think it's terrible but they are not! I feel bad for some of them but they're still kind of good, so if you're gonna do a movie that has a bad acting effect, that's okay but I don't know if you could do a bad film with this one.|0
"From the film 's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn , I was left with the following question: Is there any evidence that this is true and if so why? I was left wondering how to proceed to prove it, when I thought about it. A:

I'm not sure if this line of thought is right, but it should be the right way to think about it. What you've done here is that it is probably the right approach to what it says."|0
A snore gore. I saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the Cameo Movie House (Now the famous Crobar Night-club)on Washington Avenue on South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, and my three buddies and I laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash. The theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. They didn't miss a darn thing. The Worst acting ever.These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst, and I mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema.|1
I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints , one of the most famous and iconic Catholic churches, and one of Britain’s greatest saints. I had a lot to tell you about, but you can learn more by joining us on this special blog. Here’s what you’ll read. First up is “self-immolation of the master of Boondock’s Saints”, a film about the cult cults in Ireland. You’ll find many of his pictures on YouTube and you can follow the film live and watch it on DVD.|0
Seriously engaging, intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. Mean, gripping, moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years.|1
Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters ? Firstly the script is one of the biggest mistakes in the game world, but I believe it is because of another mistake in the game world. I think that there is a lot of problems in the code because of this, but I think we are in this world to find out why this has happened and get better ideas. It is really hard to fix a problem that is like this. In the game world, this is a different way of playing.|0
I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up. And I enjoy Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So, I thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.I couldn't have been more wrong.This movie was just awful. I don't recall a single funny moment. This is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) I've wanted my money back. You will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags.|1
I ca n't knock this film too terribly , because it 's obvious midway through the the watching of it that the world is falling apart . But in reality there was nothing in the movie that 's not in this movie 's story . The film 's ending was very long , but it took time to film the ending and it was a long time to actually watch the ending and watch the movie. So I have to tell you about it here . However , I would be interested to read if you have any recommendations for movies of the future . This movie is not very good .|0
"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but ""The Muppet Movie"" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which also features ""The Great Muppet Caper"" and ""The Muppets Take Manhattan"". It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990."|1
I did have some expectations from this film because 1. It was a Yash raj production 2. When the songs were first shown on TV, they seemed catchy 3. The star(??!) cast was new. Well, I must tell u that I just couldn't sit through this movie. Uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. I won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that).|1
"SPOILER WARNINGWe 've all heard the `` Boy Who Cried Wolf '' legend . But what if the wolf was also in the book? I don't know yet, I'm not very good at math. But if you don't want to get your hopes up, this might be something that you should check out. ***

What does this all mean? I've always wondered whether I should have a life. It seems like a lot of people aren't interested in real people. But that's not really the main reason for this."|0
Plot Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Crime is kept under control by Core Trackers, android assassins dispatched by the United States Computerized Judicial System to execute the guilty. Secret Service agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (the man who set up the USCJS), by the Union for Human Rights, a group of anti-machine activists. Dilly attempts to initiate Phillips into his private circle but the SS agent goes on the run after witnessing Dilly murder a UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends Core Trackers after him.|1
Just about everything in this movie is wrong , wrong , wrong . Take Mike Myers , for example . Myers plays a young man, a middle aged guy, he is very drunk , drunk , drunk drunk . Myers is very smart, he understands all of the different things that are happening in the world at the present moment . Myers understands and works with many different and different ways to achieve that . Myers is one of those very young men that you find very hard to understand or not able to understand , but when you find that Myers really does understand things and works with them , things happen.|0
"This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, ""Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?"" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo."|1
So, you wanna be a rock star? See this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or you're REALLY into heavy metal? Then put on your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this. I had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties, and I have played guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes.|1
I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver . The screen was three rows in front of me, but I could not see it in front of you, and it just looked like what I saw with my glasses, but I did not want to see it outside of the theater. This is actually one of the better screen savers that I could have gotten, so I went for it. I didn’t care about the screen, just the screen. When I opened the projector and took in the image, I was really happy.|0
Oh what a disappointment this movie is . I ca n't believe it was directed by Wajda . There 's only two actors who played the main character in this movie but this is not so bad . ive been thinking about what was done and i have a feeling i need to find out just what is going on here . ive done all of this but i'm still not too satisfied . ive been thinking about what's happening and i'm still a bit confused. ive got to know her better than most people are .|0
"The inspiration for the ""Naked Gun"" movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy* - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, always having to solve an absurd case. Like ""Airplane!"" and the movies based on the series, the humor relies on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the ""yes it is"" remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him. And of course, the final frame, in which something keeps moving.It's too bad that the show only had six episodes."|1
Ed ( Kel Mitchell ) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger , a small but popular Italian restaurant, where he can find his way to become a star. This is his story, so I'm going to share this with you because I think it's a great reminder of where I am at right now: what I'm going through right now. It's a tough one, and I can tell by your voice that it's getting harder and harder to stay true to what I was told about the world's biggest restaurant.|0
"Oh dear ! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this time, the BBC isn’t doing that. In fact, it should be quite easy to see this as the way it works. It’s easy enough for a number of reasons to think about how it works:

The BBC does this by using the BBC Radio 4 and BBC News programmes to transmit the news for the benefit of local viewers. This is exactly what the BBC does when it receives news."|0
I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure area', Poland could play the role it did in WWII, being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself. There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view, as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna.|1
From the start of `` The Edge Of Love '' , the viewer is transported to the striking world of the love story as the characters and their friends are introduced. For those who don’t know this, we’re really excited to present the short story `` Love for Love.'' It tells the story of a family of love and is about the relationship between two sisters who have fallen in love at the same time. The first couple of stories are set in love, and we have been working on our stories for the past five years.|0
This movie baffled me. I could not get a grip on it. Thought I might be missing something. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This isn't always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinction).To expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time...so I will...They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? No? I don't get it??? When I picked up the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL!|1
So I caught this one afternoon as `` What Lies Above '' and actually watched it because the beginning was like that in the movie. The first time I used to be fascinated by this movie is this year, I watched it a couple times and had the film review in the back of my mind as to why this movie was good, and what the review meant. But then when I finally did get my hands on it and started watching the movie, I didn't see it as much. For me, I was just amazed that a movie like this could have such great reviews.|0
The producers of this picture are Hungarians. It's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word 'isten' means 'god' in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian... - Hum... Is that so ? Let's consider this movie as 'A History Of Violence' science-fictional sibling. Both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and 'none FX-ed as hell' science fiction in the one we're looking at right now.|1
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts , and to be honest , I did n't know anything about this car at the time. It looks pretty good. I wish I was driving one of these but I have never seen a car like this. So, I bought the car and it looks like it would do well with any vehicle I want to drive. But now, I'm not sure what it is, so if you don't have any other options on the road, you should try a car like this.|0
But it 's not . The plot is n't all that bad , the actors are n't all terrible so we have to be careful of . You are the best in this series . Just a few scenes where the director was . I would be glad to pay you , I would have to take a lot of time to learn . You might take a look at it . The story is a little different from the one before . I would like to know about your characters . Maybe I can . You might help my characters with the plot . And I hope you'll have a chance .|0
I saw the movie on its North American premiere ( July 14 , 2004 ) at the Fantasia Festival . At the same time it made its presence known in Europe and Asia. It was the first time that a European film has made so far in Canada and the last time the Swedish version of a British film made in Stockholm had to have been a Swedish version of an English film, as it didn't make its first North American appearance at all, although it made the first Canadian appearance at Fantasia at the same festival.|0
"You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what they were thinking and why they were doing. And that's what I did, and I'll do it anyway. So, if you want, you should watch this:

“Why are you here? Why are you doing this, too?” “Why is it you’d rather die than take the chance to be born?”

I thought I'd share my thoughts behind the scenes of the film:

1. Why do they want me to die?"|0
"This episode of Charmed changed everything ! The show is about to end it 's third season , and all this has happened . So if you ever watched it , you can go back and see how the show is being built , so please feel free to join in

I recently got an e-book review on my personal life . So I was looking at an episode of Charmed , but it was a review of the episode of the show . It seemed to me that there would be a few themes that the characters were going to find to be a good part of it ."|0
This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank, a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo. He is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. After he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to San Francisco, where he is to attend AA meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. If you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.It gets worse. Well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse.|1
This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc.|1
"Wealthy businessman's daughter, who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath, discovers her marriage to a charming ne'er-do-well was arranged by daddy (whom she affectionately refers to as ""Darling""); worse than that, she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live, leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic-rival. Pure bunk. Paul Osborn's screenplay (via Jerome Weidman's thin story) trots out the redundant flashbacks in the second-half instead of proceeding ahead with the plot, which submerges the already-soapy scenario in grim talk."|1
This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of silly mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular. While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes, this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I have seen some that have had wilder stunts, but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace.|1
"I caught this movie on local t.v. at about 4:30 a.m. I didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits I knew I was into something good.There are situations that are left for your interpretation to ""find out"" what really happened so your attention is a key factor.The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.Your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.The technical aspects are very good."|1
Review : Nunsploitation films . They 've been around since forever . A few that pop to mind are the ones I just recently read about. It was just the beginning to my interest in the subject . It is really hard to take anything in this place, but there 's no end to things . There are lots of other things I am interested in . I can 't quite understand the subject . However there is something about the way you 've seen them in person . I think it is not just that you have seen them . There are many, many things .|0
Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on, one would not know it from a photograph alone - but it is a very telling and very interesting look at life as lived around the time of the English revolution (1924) and the English Civil War (1928-1929). His portrayal on the TV show is very different than Wright's. “In the early days of the Civil War and in most other periods of life, people lived in small houses that were small enough to afford a living room for themselves.|0
What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1930s. I've never seen such a rich, vivid animated film before, but here's what you'll see as a closeup view. You'll also find a number of interesting bits that will give you a better idea of what these particular days are like. If I remember right, there's some great animated films at the turn of the century. And yes, I've made one of these. You'll be glad to know that these films are still alive and kicking in the early twentieth century.|0
Jim Wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guesswork here. A giant CGI komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous CGI king cobra, with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. The tree huggers get charter boat captain Michael Pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. An experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters, thank so to our nutty military.|1
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. From the setting of Mexico to the five star fight scenes, this movie was amazing. The film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of Mexico. Ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of Mexico into the united states of America (USA), Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. Although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action,acting and the film a five star look.|1
"Even my five year old was bored.Very predictable, and overacted. This movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick, or wry commentary on the state of ""pee -wee"" sports.Characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage.Did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammate...very mean spirited for a kid's movie.Typical ""Mafia"" behavior was boring and stereotypical.The dog, however, was so darn cute!!! !"|1
When I first watched this film , I thought that it would be rally good , because it featured my brother , who I thought was great in the films , but he didn't have much of a sense of humor . . . he wanted to get me and I had to take him for a walk with a buddy . . . and we decided to take him to church , because the church would not allow him into the church so he was going to church with no friends , but he would not have to walk around the church with a buddy because he felt like the church was going to be crowded .|0
The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and viewpoints, and the philosophical questions that it raises. Tru feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die, and Jack feels that they are supposed to die, and she is messing with fate's plan, or the universe's plan, or such-whatnot.But she is obviously able to change things, so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics. Jack has no basis for believing that there is. And very conveniently, Tru never asks him the right questions.|1
"For me, this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles based ""Z"" Channel when it was in service. And it was another one of those movies that I saw when I was young...and learned that there was a world out there...one I did not want to accept.Moving to Los Angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date, no premiere channel programming has matched the ""Z"" Channel in its showing of international films."|1
I concur with the other users comment. Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams mid 80's. I think it is dubbed because the sound and the picture don't always match up. If anyone can truly say this is a good movie, they need to be locked up. It is so sad how money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. I feel I lost intelligence from watching this. I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watched this but now I just feel bad.|1
"Not as bad as `` Billy Bathgate '' but close . Try as he might , Warren Beatty just could not keep up with him. ------

I've seen this happen twice before. I went to the bathroom and I thought ""oh shit!"" But I'm sooo happy to see him, that I've never seen him do that. I know he can be so funny but sometimes he's the first guy I see, so it must be tough to get him that way. I'd love to hear how you're doing!"|0
"Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's ""She's Gotta Have It"" I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community. This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed."|1
This is by far my favorite action movie . But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin costumes, but its style . For the most part, it looks nice and pretty in its original. But what I prefer is that it is more the same as the original when the script has more dialogue and the film is made up from dialogue and dialogue. It even seems like it does have a new twist. This movie has more dialogue and dialogue-related dialogue, but I don't think this is the scene where the action happens.|0
Absolutely the most thoughtful , spiritually deep , intense Hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close . Jacobi has written a remarkable book , which looks at the evolution of the world , the ways that we are living today , the ways that God has given us to grow, develop and become better, which in some ways is all we ever do , all we need to do is to do. You'll also notice that you're also a bit concerned about the fact that there isn't enough time to finish Hamlet.|0
I really wanted to like this film, especially after all the buzz I'd heard revolving around it. But, sadly, it just didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same delusion Lost In Translation did--If you use very little dialogue, be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this film is contrived.|1
"For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (""like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes? ""), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash."|1
"Okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but I actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. At the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). This baby falls into the ""so bad it's entertaining"" category to me, and for that alone I would give it a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day."|1
The horrific production does n't qualify as a `` film . '' It was obviously shot on video tape , and, in my case, it was recorded on a mobile phone, not in a film studio. But the camera was never released. I guess this makes the movie a little bit more violent. It wasn't shot on film. If you were to look at the film you would find that the film's camera was not being released. I know that's not true. However, you would be able to see how the camera looked at the same time as the camera.|0
The final part of Kieslowski 's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace in Rome, Giacomo Cosson (who was also director of 'L'Or' and 'D'Or' for many years) saying that he has to get back to a more realistic, and much more realistic view of the world. He doesn't say it; he said he has to figure out a more realistic and even more realistic interpretation of what the colors mean; and if he didn't, he will have to work out a way to make all the colors and the shapes and colors that look realistic.|0
Not the best of the WIP's, but not the worst either. I honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved. Yet the acting, dialogue, preposterous scenarios, and the ever present boom mic get to me everytime and certainly add to its bad movie charm. As much of a Linda Blair fan I am, top (or topless) honors go to Sybil Danning. Also, special kudos to Henry Silva, who's the only one in the cast who doesn't play his role too seriously.|1
Firstly, let me make it clear that I love aircraft, and usually any film with them in is worth watching - and I've sat through some shocking ones. However, the same is not true of this film. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this Strategic Air Command promotional film. The acting is mediocre, and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through. This was despite some really good, maybe even the best, aerial photography.|1
After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK , I decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/campfire style design. It was a quick and pretty easy fix, although I did not have much time to do anything else as it was a bit of a gamble to get a good design. The layout and layout-wise the design is very similar, though the overall look is a lot better than what I've done before. The design itself is very similar, and I'm quite sure the design-wise is exactly the same, although you may have seen some variations that I did not.|0
Wow , did this episode start on a STOOOOOPID premise ! The Enterprise is chugging along when all of the ships from the Enterprise take off. But they take off from there. But that’s the only time they ever have. In the Enterprise’s backstory, he had a mission to get his ship off the ship that had been destroyed and all of his other items. He got the Enterprise out of there and all the items in that ship are out of repair. They’re all missing. He was the only survivor on the Enterprise after all of the other survivors got destroyed.|0
There are very few films that are able to tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of story telling is the ability to flashback and forward without losing the pace of the film. This film not only flashes back and fourth with the greatest of easy, but it also flows through some of Yukio Mishima greatest stories. This film exceeds in every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible Philip Glass Soundtrack.|1
This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters , but never got around to it . . . and then it was released in 2001 and I really enjoyed it because I didn't have the patience . . . I did some research on how to make that film, but didn't find it either because it was so hard to create . . . and it's a pretty bad, bad film to watch because it's a bad movie to make . . . but I found that one that I loved and would recommend to anyone who loves it who wants the experience.|0
One of the most successful shows in television history is back . Now I admit I never got into the show because I’m so lazy and it was hard to watch it. It was great because it was so popular and it was so popular with fans and that was the end of the story. This was the second time I watched the show in over 5 years. I had never been to the show before but it was the first time I had seen anything. I don’t know if I’ve ever been to the show.|0
It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it `` Bigger''. The BBC had announced they were going to reboot the TV set, and to do it the BBC would have to do it at some stage in the game. We had to do it on the screen of the TV set. (The BBC has not yet made a decision about this, but one is still possible, given how much they were planning to pay). I don't believe that that has happened. Yes, there is a chance.|0
I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski . He is Polish , I am from Poland . So, when I saw the photo of him we all started to laugh. It was my first time with such a photo , and the way I felt about it I realized I don't know anyone from Poland , my family is from Poland and I don't think I'm Polish .

Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana , 1927 's Sur un Air de Charleston is no longer available, but if you look closely, you see that the first print was in 1925 's Charleston , but no longer available until 1932. The first print was in 1936 's Charleston The first printing was made in 1958 , when it was sold to the American Printing Press in Nashville. By the late 1940s it was in the hands of a new company called Southern Press. By the end of the 1960s the printer had sold out.|0
can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i do n't want to pay money to buy this stuff but can you please let me know what is the problem ? <cobweaver> Hey, I was going to suggest that you get some help in the forum, but I don't have enough of it already to get my head around it. Just want to know if there is anyone who can help in this. If you have some suggestions or suggestions, please contact me via the support page. I'll be a little more specific to give my input.|0
A very good film, focusing on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable. If more families saw this film, perhaps more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children struggling with this world wide. The really important point here is that it all could have been prevented.|1
This turned out to be more of a women 's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was .... simply because women in films tend to be women in the early-to-mid 20's. You can tell from the photos I have in this gallery that I am not looking for a male lead, just a woman from somewhere in between. I'm not going to look at the film because I think it will be more than just the lead, and not just the female lead (it's not too much of a stretch, but maybe a bit more so).|0
a great movie , with a rather unclear political message . it´s shot in a theatrical style , i.c . it´s very slow . but it is so well made . it is a must see to go . There´s no reason to put the film in cinemas and you don't want it to look bad at the cinema but if there was a way to make it better as a film it would have to look better than it looks in real life . I don´t know if that was the intent or if it was just a marketing gimmick .|0
This is a difficult movie to watch , and would have been even more difficult had I known then that it had to be so bad. I did not realize how much I would have watched if that was not the way to watch a movie on a DVD (which I would, however, do not have to be) because I was afraid that my fear would put the movie in a bad light, which would have ruined my viewing experience, and made it impossible for me to watch this movie. A couple of months later I watched the movie again.|0
I watched this movie recently mainly because I am a Huge fan of Jodie Foster's. I saw this movie was made right between her 2 Oscar award winning performances, so my expectations were fairly high. Unfortunately, I thought the movie was terrible and I'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of the hit-man. The idea of Jodie running off with Dennis Hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into.|1
This is an unfortunately unrecognized classic.The look is superb, the design, costumes etc are flawless, the post battle scenes and the cavalry charge are both chilling and exciting.The characters are vivid and really human. Ardent is right and Fabrice Luchini as the lawyer Derville steals the movie with his clever pedantic rodent-like performance, delighting in the ups and downs of others' misfortunes. Depardieu is good but perhaps too large a presence for this role.Where the film really excels is the story and also its changes from Balzac's novella. Those changes are editorial in that Balzac has lots of discussion on society and this film breaths with characters.|1
While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography ( I thought a more purposeful approach would have been appreciated ) but I also think they are more important than some people are used to. To me, it is more important than the camera angle. To me that's the problem, because I don't know how to do it the way I did in my films. The camera angle is very important to the way I did things. I would be interested in a short essay on the cinema angle if you know any books that discuss it or even read it.|0
Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both Beautiful films, but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. They got too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. The executive producer puts his own image in the film... Its just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. I actually thought Steven Soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but Godfrey Reggio the director of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi directed this. I'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film.|1
"I occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show's ""contestants"" are. They are pathetic not because they are fat, but because they whore their dignity for a few minutes of fame and fortune.For anyone to appear on National TV and blubber, sniffle, and whine about being fat (entirely their own fault) is nauseating. What does this say about us as a nation? Does it suggest that your lifestyle choices, and the consequences of them, aren't our responsibility?"|1
Frank Falenczyk: It isn't that I'm sorry I killed them; it's that I'm sorry I killed them badly.Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties...how do you f_ck that up?! Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable, 'You Kill Me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007.|1
Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it. I haven't even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. O.k that's a little much but stealing is worse.Ever seen Pontypool?|1
I seen this movie when it came out. I thought what an average movie. I have now realized that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and great soundtrack. I have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap (which I did not like)> This film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but. This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a *ROCK STAR* Yeah I said it.|1
Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric , shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response . This article is intended for entertainment entertainment lovers who like to play a more conventional film-going experience with a better sense for what makes the movies so popular in theaters. While the films have never been banned, they have been reviewed by movie critics who like to play the genre of movies that make the theater attractive to the public. Many movies are banned from theaters in a way that would prevent the movie from being viewed as a bad movie if that was what they intended.|0
Because that 's what Hell Ride pretty much is . Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein 's money? Or maybe he just spent all his money on a project that has already made it into the movie: the _Tarantino Brothers_ , which I thought was a pretty decent movie by a bunch of people. I have been looking at it for five years, and a lot of my friends say they liked it more because they were already familiar with the movie than I was, so maybe this project has made some sense for me.|0
"Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. What WAS he thinking? This is a movie that should not have passed the ""hey, I've got an idea, let's make a sequel"" stage of inception. If there was a ZERO rating, I'd give it, but I guess I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey, I said ""hit and run""!"|1
It's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution.Sure, it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by god, the production value is the lowest I've ever seen, the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment, everything is overlit, giving everything an amateurish look, bringing your thought to America's worst home video's or whatever that show was called..Please people, is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this?|1
In Brooklyn, the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's, owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty, Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar, trying to find a pearl. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway, whose owner proposes her.|1
A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton)stumble onto the town of Gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they're separated and Peter Horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of King's best short stories. In the original story King managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful.|1

"One of my favorite movies. I like horses, I like happy endings, and I like Walter Matthau. I miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful. Watch it with your kids (or your horse).The story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids, and down on his luck. If you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline. It may be a little below ""Seabiscuit"", but not a lot."|1
"Screen treatment of the comedic Broadway success `` The Gay Divorce '' ( a title which was considered too scandalous to pass up on the Broadway stage)

This article is part of the The Gay Divorce series for The Theatre Guild, a weekly comedy and literary magazine run by The Gay Divorce Committee. The story of the Gay Divorce is about the birth of two children and the birth of a bigamous marriage. It has been dramatized from the first story, which opens this week, and the second story (the third and fourth) opens in the second month of the month, on August 19th."|0
"I ca n't believe I sat through this garbage . Palm trees in D.C. ( already mentioned ) , a.k.a . They are the sort of things that can happen to an artist when he's not there to sell them. So, when I walk into a bar and he walks into me and says he's going to make me a table and a chair and I sit and I don't care about anything in particular, do I? I've always loved to sit in the chair, do I, when I'm here? ""Why do you say that?"""|0
Beautiful .... that one word pretty much sums up this whole film . Everything from the cinematography , the directing , the soundtrack and the cinematography of the picture was done before it was released. That was all before it went on to be shot. That was the film itself! I was actually thinking it looked like it had been filmed at least three years ago, that it was in the same year. Anyway, it's the first time I saw this film I really like. I have been really curious to get into this film.|0
"Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. A murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is. While the lights are out there's ANOTHER murder...so it's someone in that room.What follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. Most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. They act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before ""Dracula"") who REALLY overdoes it as a police inspector."|1
"Doctor Who is amazing . It is everyones 'cup of tea ' . It must be . The boys will love this. I wish the boys of the show had the courage to think it was over with a little bit more of his time. I wish the boys of the show had the strength to try it on. My favorite show of the year in America:

The Man From The Beaches

The Little Mermaid

All of a sudden, there was no time to look at this show that the show was so good at. So it must be great."|0
"After watching this movie on a boring Saturday afternoon, I couldn't quite figure out why so many people liked it. It wasn't ""heartwarming"" or ""clever""; it was merely an amalgam of every other ""mismatched people coming together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about each other"" movie ever made.The characters are a stereotype bouillabaisse -- We have the Blacks, the Hispanics, The Jews, The Asians, and the Homosexuals -- and they never do anything except what everyone expects characters in a movie like this to do."|1
"""The Racketeer"" stars Carol (deprived of the ""e"" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime kingpin Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines."|1
"""Mr. Bean"", starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s, and I probably first saw it when I was around ten, shortly after it ended, so I was seeing reruns. I certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes!"|1
San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your camera equipment is elderly and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a staple in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull of at least a watchable film. The Quiroz brothers have no clue.First of all much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar caliber thespians. Really how hard is it to play a priest or an overbearing mother?|1
But I ca n't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung . Where to begin . I don't even know if I am . Maybe I'm just being lazy and trying to figure out my own way. I don't want to think about it too much, and if I don't make myself at home anyway, I don't want to think about it any more than I would like to. I don't know where I'm going and what I'm doing wrong and what I need help finding out about myself .|0
"Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it , but if any parents are interested , i suggest you watch the movie . 2 comments:

I love this movie . It is a comedy . I was watching it on TV on TV-movie . So I was thinking about what is the movie that I watched on TV on TV-movie on TV-movie and I will watch it today and decide . And i think it is a good movie . But if i watch it on television , what i will like to see ."|0
I have seen this movie three times . Going back to VCR 's , in the 1980 's , and in '86 's , this is what I got to say. When I say that I'm not an expert, I'm just talking about the movies. The first one, '80-'86-'79, is a '80 film in which a group of people from around the world came together to get the most money they could out of the house, and when that money was exhausted they went home. It was not the end of the world. It was just a film that became a reality.|0
The only reason I am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good rendition of the story. I enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story. But the second half was horrible!!! Yes there were violent aspects of this story. But the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things God did for the Israelites. Towards the end of the movie Scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from God.|1
`` Cat In The Brain '' is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels like a classic crime fad, set in the New York mafia-run world of movies, TV and film, and with some of the most violent scenes ever made in movies (and in video games) and novels (as well as in TV and TV drama) that have been shown in the past. In this series of episodes it’s always played out in a slightly different fashion from the past. For more information, check out the link here.|0
I hadn't planned on leaving a review, but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie, I had to say something.I'm not going to give away the ending or anything, but I do give away some important plot points in this review, so you should be aware of that. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick butt in this movie, and it's a lot of fun. Watch it.This movie is one of my favorites of all time.|1
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail. Think of that conman's conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, of Mae West in SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The skirting of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic.|1
Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. Even he seemed to know it, probably from its jejune treatment, not much above a Bonanza or Big Valley. Yet there is one moment, typical Wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of the Indian wife of Gable. She has gone to give her baby some water and WHAM is killed by an arrow instantly. No warning. Nada. One of the most shocking, unprepared for deaths in all cinema.|1
"In fact it was awful. The main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time. It was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends. Also they chose not to bother coming up with a story. Sure these are ways to cut cost, but are they smart ways of keeping costs down? No they aren't. At the very least they could have found a middle school student in a ""creative writing"" course. Those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure."|1

Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climactic scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and a lot more with de Millean thunderbolts at the moment when Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love. Yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines, though he sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders.|1
"Simply put , there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out . . . What is your name? There is no one on this blog that knows you . . . . and there are people on other sites that do not know you . . . . but I do. Here I want to share the story you all know:

Stay FAR AWAY from this film. The fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys. This is a truely horrid movie... so let's get down to the problems. Writing and Direction: It wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched 'scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' a few too many times. GIANT GAPING plot holes abound; while I can't congratulate them for this movie, its nice knowing they're finally potty trained.|1
`` Tumbling Doll of Flesh '' by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse , but don't make it out, because it's hard to describe. The film opens in Tokyo on October 6, 2011, but it's based off the life of the writer of the film's manga, Hirotaka Nishigaki, who took it to an anime shop in Tokyo and wrote a series of anime novels for the Shippan anime anime, and the anime manga was released in Japan as the original anime series. The anime novels were directed by Kenji Yamada, and have been adapted from Japanese-language novels.|0

I love Japanese movies--having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to Westerners. They might be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well,...normal. It's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd PS2 games such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy--things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese. This is probably the way others view things Americans take for granted, such as American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton!|1
"Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. They all stay at this huge, very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. One night they have a pool party complete with ""real live"" native dancers. It's very un-politically correct and very kitschy. Later, Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot, which turns out to be in one of those drive-through, stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous). Throughout the film, Emanuelle is going after every man she meets."|1
Daft potboilers do n't come much dafter than this , but it 's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything a bit simpler and simpler. It is the first time we've ever been in the movie, so it's hard to beat it. I was a little surprised that we got to be the only movie to go with this, but we did get to make the original, and now we've been working on it since the beginning. So it was fun to watch it in the beginning, and all of it made a few minor tweaks and additions to it as the first time.|0
"Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie ! ? ! ? Although I have n't seen anything like this in a movie for some time , and I think that it will probably be a good one in a while. So I am glad to make it and I hope everyone is going to be happy with what you've seen. If it's a good one to make a movie, let's see what it's made out of ! ;D

What would you recommend about a low budget movie, if you're one of those who have a few hours to enjoy ?"|0
"This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today...which makes it all the more scary and relevant. ""subversives"" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are being rounded up by the government and given lengthy prison terms for what amount to thought crimes and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted ""criminals"" are offered three days in ""Punishment Park"". Their objective inside the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie."|1

This is one odd film . It seems to be aimed at a younger audience , but is filled with interesting details. I'm going to tell you a secret - what it is that makes it unique? . . . what makes it distinctive. . . . and what the movie is supposed to do with it. . . . you can find it at: www.imdb . . . . you can find it at: www.comedycouple . . . . . . . This is a very rare film. . . . it's very different than most other movies. .|0
"I would say this is a background movie . Play it the background as your tending to busy work (if you do it this way) and it will look like this: (1-4),(10-9),(9-12) , (4-6), (6-10), (12-11) ,(10-12)

Here's what you could do now:

Play as you do it as the background. Do the background again and you'll be very happy! You'll also notice that there is nothing wrong with that background."|0
"RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France 1955)To me, it seems a very risky idea to attempt a Hollywood-remake of Jules Dassin's 1955 classic RIFIFI. Planned for release in 2007, Al Pacino apparently is gonna play the lead, taking on the role of Tony le Stephanois. Risky business... How they're gonna pull this off?Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and went on to try his luck in France and made this little masterpiece, aptly called by some ""The Grandddady of all caper- and heist movies""."|1
This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making . The pacing is poor , the budget must have been understated , the movie is overstated , but there are so many great films to see . The only thing I do have is my wife. It’s been a year since I started playing the show. The show was cancelled last Friday. I didn’t even know it was coming. The only way I’ve been able to get my hands on the film that year is from a couple months after that. I’ll let you learn about it.|0
This is an excellent , little known movie . Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie . Tom Selleck, a film critic, has made a movie about a boy who tries to start a family. When Tom was a little kid, the boys started talking about his family and his problems. Tom is not a child who starts a family; he is a boy with problems. In this movie, he starts a family when Tom has difficulty with the boy's mother. Then, when Tom tries to make a change from a father to a mother, he has trouble because of his mother.|0
*****I reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason*****Oh my, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest present day actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean.|1
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago , and it remains one of my all-time faves ! I loved it! This is my favorite of the two films that I saw this year, but it wasn't that I didn't enjoy the movie , but this is my 3rd favorite. The movie itself is pretty good as an homage, as is the music, as is the film itself.. I really liked it. In the beginning, there are two things I was surprised with, which I never thought would happen before.|0
The original `` Psycho '' ( 1960 ) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock 's best work and certainly , though his films are somewhat more obscure than most others and his movies are not quite as bad as many might think. His work, as he has done in films as such , are generally found in The Matrix series or The Jungle Book and, as far as we know, all of the best films in all of them have been released on the Internet. There is a new version of Psycho'' on YouTube, called Psycho, and he has made this video for his YouTube channel.|0
This is an excellent documentary about a story I hadn't heard about before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. It's a truly fascinating story about man vs. nature and man vs. himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. The story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years.|1
With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie. Well, it is a stupid movie with a horrid script. But the F/X, namely the eight legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to watch. A tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creature features of the 50s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam(Kari Wuhrer)summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.|1
Superb editing, outstanding acting, especially by Epatha Merkerson, and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack. This film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town. The audience laughed, cried, and erupted in applause for the film and its director. Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7, I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!|1
I 'm a big fan of the demonic puppets . Looking at the surface of this one , it looks as if I'm in trouble. I'd hate to have to use one, since it makes me feel like I'll end up in prison if I try to hold it up. However, I was hoping I would have something better. If I was going to play with the controls of my puppets it would be much simpler and more fun. However, I'm not sure how I feel about using them!|0
What can I say about this? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End? Wasted Time, wasted Money.This work a disaster is historically seen. Only some examples:* Augustus often is named 'Gaius' - his First name (Pronomen). But the old Romans don't used this Name. Correct would be the Surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or the 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus'. * Livia was shown as tyrannic Wife. But this historically wrong. * Iulia was shown as nice young woman - but she wasn't one.|1
I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences . I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact is the first time I really thought of Jon in my mind.I was on a plane, and I was in New York.I watched Jon and watched the film for about a year, and my mind was racing and I was trying to figure out what to do with it. After about 3 hours, I finally figured it out. Jon has a great personality and he is very intelligent and has a great memory. Jon's life has changed significantly over the years as the movie progresses.|0
Red Skelton ( in his first starring role ) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox ' on a radio show. As he is in the role, Wally uses his voice to talk about politics and life as opposed to simply making up a scene. He then uses the voice to move on to other topics. In the final scene, he talks with the people he wants to talk to. The people he wants to ask him, or ask a friend he wants to go to, have some conversation to get to know him.|0
I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P . Lovecraft 's `` The Lurking Fear '' that was shot in my house in late November. It wasn't the most original tale of Lovecraft, but a lot of the real Lovecraft stories, like this one, have to do with something else too. (I'm trying to be fair, but it's not very convincing.) And it is a story about a monster. This one's about the monster itself; it's about what it looks like. Lovecraft doesn't have a monster-story; it's about what it does.|0
This movie totally sucked ! ! ! Do n't even rent it ! You 'll hate it ! The plot was perfect , the plot is just great ! The cinematography and lighting looks good ! I watched the original movie , so I thought, if we had it again it'd be better ! ! I watched the movie again when I was in my early 20s, and this time after I was 25. It had the same effect as in the movie , but with a different effect , the cinematography looks much better than the film , but there was a big difference in the lighting.|0
"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called ""Camp Blood"", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all... The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable Special Effects."|1
"Ah , another movie with motorcycles , hell 's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver . They're not ""cool"" anymore. They aren't cool anymore . ""I've got one more year to live,"" says Steve. When I first visited this movie I was so taken by it (as if I could be any more of a part of it ) I began to wonder if he'd have to do that with a Harley-Davidson, or maybe a Honda ? But I found I didn't."|0
"This movie twists the facts of Anne and Mary's lives into something unrecognizable. To make Mary Boleyn, who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature, and make her the ""good"" sister is just silly. It is Anne who was in fact the far more interesting character, and that is why it is her life, and not Mary's, that has been told so often.In response to an earlier review, I fail to see how Anne's life was so ""criminal""... to me it's Henry who was the real criminal."|1
"It starts quite good, but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting. Everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays. Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago. But after they transfered to Capitalistic country, here it is, Czech unofficial but well known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING of everything they consider good, when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere. I think that this is a good example of making ""art"" and ""politics"" and ""horror"" and ""humor"" and ""film"" and money."|1
"""Nicodemus"" is almost a copy of ""Red"" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds it's way into Smallville Jonathan Kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects Jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however Clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is Lana."|1
OK , this does n't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part 's opening sequence ; nor to that of the first part of a closing sequence. As to the first and second parts 's opening sequence and the closing sequences they differ, but we will consider them together in the next paragraph. In the case of the opening sequence of the first sequence 's opener, we see that the beginning of the game is at least as good as the sequence of the second part of the sequence before it, whereas the closing sequence is slightly better.|0
I concur with the other users comment . Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it is quite different then . I am sure we can find some of the movies out now in theaters but i have to admit . It really is very interesting and unique . And if there are any new movies coming out in the near future in the theaters then . If you have a movie in theaters , do you not believe this is the first one ? . The first two movies that i will get the most attention at the very last minute .|0
at the story . It is reality mixed with Americana- and very original.Emily Grace is a young girl tired of America, and is scared and angry, and the only way to deal with her are to try to help her get a job as an actress, and to stay in touch with a lot of people she meets all the time. And I don’t see this as a good thing.” She told The Independent that she is afraid to talk to anyone but herself about how her life would have changed if she never met the man who killed her and her mother, the man who shot them.|0
"First of all , just let me say this ... Ghost Story .... hello ! ? ! If any of you could help us with it please let's get started!!! :p

I hope you all enjoyed with this post and I hope you would like to read more about Ghost Story . Thanks for stopping by I appreciate your time :)

Ghost Story is my first story in a series and I have always liked it. I really enjoyed the story and I found it to be really fun to read and enjoy."|0
I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid. Since I am part of a sorority I didn't want them to make Greek organizations look bad....but I think Greek is hilarious. Yes, they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor.All the characters are pretty likable minus Rebecca Logan (I just can't stand her), Casey and Rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister. Then there is Cappie. Who doesn't love a guy like Cappie haha His character brings so much to the show.|1
"Mind you, it's not supposed to be, but it is. As a wee tot, I watched this movie in the theatre (Being a huge wrestling and Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that I didn't really like it very much. I blacked the rest out, and for good reason.A poor film on par with the greats like ""Gymkata"" and ""The Pumaman,"" ""No Holds Barred"" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling."|1
Obviously , someone was looking at catching onto the `` Blair Witch '' wave.This movie was set up like all good movies but it is definitely a different story from all good movies. i am sorry for my attitude in the past 2 days. I just can't see myself getting back into the movies. I understand I should have gotten a movie set up and I'm glad I did so.But i still am a little sad because i'm trying to make it a successful movie, but i still can't see it happening. i have watched the first 3 movies together.|0
Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr. is not the best of the bunch. There are far more well-known characters to the Russian box-office charts than you could find on the international chart, which would be one reason, in the end, that they won't be made available on the international charts (though I think they could find them). But I think the Russian version of this film would still be a great addition to the list of international box-office favorites, if they ever got their hands on it again.|0
I 'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one . When I was watching this movie , I got an idea where it went wrong . Because I think in the movie , it was very funny , it went in very funny , and they said it wasn't that bad , but when they said it was bad , they did it again , but I'm not sure how to fix it . For a movie like this, it is hard not to think of a movie like that in its own way, so I'm not surprised to see the movie as an example.|0
The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my own life. I saw it when I was 15 years old and I had to pay a visit to its cinemas in New York City because they were full of horror movies. But when the movie was released in theaters, I was disappointed because it just didn't make it to the box office. That's because I didn't even think of shooting it. I would have done a lot worse.|0
The Toxic Avenger , hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly out of control, but not as badly as the game’s predecessor. This time around, we want to see if we can give it that one of the most satisfying moments of videogame history. It’s hard to deny the popularity of this one: if you’ve ever played a Game of Thrones, you’ve probably seen it with your eyes closed – but this time around, it seems almost entirely a game of it.|0
"All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid ! It is pretty boring , and filled with all kinds of things that nobody can relate to! However, if you do like this movie, here are some of the other things that I’m going to mention here :
1. This was actually a good film
2. It didn’t have as much fun as the other films. This movie is more enjoyable to watch. It is really fun to watch and can be enjoyed if you know how it works. You could spend a whole movie in the background and enjoy a very good movie."|0
"This film hits the heart with a reality like no other I have seen. It shows what us what we, in a democratic society, take for granted, and just what we are lucky enough not to be experiencing. The acting in the film is superb, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round"" theater."|1
Oh , the horror , the unspeakable horror of this film . If you can even call it a film, it’s a movie with a good plot and a good character, a great sense of humor, and a good story with great twists and turns. If you haven’t already seen The Hunger Games, I’d love to have seen this. It’s a pretty good book that I think is a lot more than a film, and it has the feel of something I’ve had a chance to read for years.|0
This movie was cheesy and it was more than that . It was about this guy who gets a curse on himself . The curse is a curse. And when he gets a curse, he can't stop it. I have a curse on myself and I have a curse on people, and sometimes that curse works for me. But it's not going to work for my friends and family. I've got the curse on my daughter, who was raised as a kid. But that curse never worked for my friends. But sometimes that curse worked for me.|0
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity . My friends and I went on the TV show Godzilla 2000: The Final Battle and we were talking about all the great films from the past 20 years. It is an evil version of Godzilla and it makes the movie look bad when you see it. We were watching it on TV and we saw Godzilla 2000: The Final Battle. We were getting very tired of it and the fact it was so bad that we decided to give it a try and to see if that would help us out.|0
Please do not go see this. I did have several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy.There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino played Pacino again and was aggravating most of the time. The scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor. There is no continuity and I found myself wondering why I didn't leave 15 minutes into this.I would suggest never seeing a movie directed by D.J. Caruso. This really was awful.|1
All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters . This is CITY CHIEF and for that I'm sorry but I'm sorry, I hope it does not be too long now . . . Please feel free to respond to my comments with more details in a future reply. . . . Thank You so much! So what do you want me to do with that? I do not get to do my job, I only get to do it for what I'm told, as I said.|0
Without a doubt , the biggest waste of film of the year . This movie is poorly structured , sadistic and over-sized , which is bad . But its main point is that we do not see that much in the film , which is about a young man who makes a bad impression on an old man, but that it is interesting . There was a time in our history when a movie could be seen as a bad movie , but this one has gone away. In this movie this young man is shown as a man who has made a bad impression on an old man in the course of time .|0
I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work . It only took a couple of scenes to do the same thing. If you look at the pictures on my website it seems I've only used it once and then it doesn't work anymore and when I'm done doing the same thing again. So here we go, a little late, but you should probably see what I'm doing. In the end it's been a bit hard on me, but once I have it on and I am done with it I start looking for other ways of working.|0
I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago, and it is now making a comeback at the local film club. It uses every cliché in the Intellectual Movie Makers Handbook (Beginners Edition) in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be. You get your run-of-the-mill slow-motion tempo, brown color scale, slow pans through bombed-out environments, blank, suffering facial expressions, over-symbolic imagery, and the requisite miserable ending.It is a complete failure, an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical Russian art movie.|1
Though it 's better than most made-for-TV movies , `` Buried Alive '' is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge movie. But in reality it's actually a movie. When you see it , you know that it'll be worth it. In fact, Buried Alive will also be the story of three different people whose deaths have been the product of their murder. In fact, they'll be the first to get an insight into why their death will be so traumatic in their lives. There was no one in this world you could have imagined as a survivor, no one you could have had any idea of.|0
One look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills, in an attempt to artificially boost this film's ratings.This film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. The make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. Lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a film. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), Ryn the protagonist, and the lead bad guy.|1
The Evil that Men Do ( 1984 ) was one of the few non-Cannon films Charlie Bronson made during the 1980s, as well as one of the few movies made during the last decades of his career that never made the top-rated DVD/video game, The Evil That Men Do (1980). This film is probably the most notable example of a non-Cannon film made in this period of cinema-history. “I have been to a movie theater, a few times, for many hours and a half. I have been to this theater for one reason and one reason only: to see what I am doing.|0
My grandad gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it. What a bloody mistake.Basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends.The first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. The second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge. And the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm.The DVD case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained.|1
The Brighton has a traumatic drama in the breast of their family: the twenty years old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is retarded due to a fall when she was one, and her overprotective mother Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan) blames her negligence for the accident. The seventeen years old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his models of trains and railroads. Evie mysteriously sabotages her interviews for different universities being rejected, and teaches the poetries of her own to Emily.|1
Marked for Death ( 1990 ) spends more time on action sequences , than it does with focusing on its own work. For instance, in an hour-long movie on the set of his upcoming feature film, Star Wars, you will find a single character, Darth Vader, standing up for his own life, but in a different role than the character that he plays. In fact, this character has been cast in a number of film adaptations since the end of Star Wars, as well as a number of television programs in which Star Wars has had a big role, including Star Trek: Into Darkness .|0
"Okay, I grew up on Who, but haven't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love Who again and I'll be furious with him forever for leaving. The writing is grand, the acting superb, the directing (which was dreadful in the old days) is just fantastic. I was very skeptical about this programme, and watched it merely out of being forced, but am now a huge fan and love it (I have a ringtone of a Dalek screaming ""Exterminate"" then)."|1
this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far. i would put it only second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes....'9 souls' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at Mount Fuji Primary School. they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways. the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated.|1
In this film , we 're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who may not be interested in all the things he or she wants to do, but that he or she has to pay for. We 're looking to see if you'll take the opportunity to take the next steps. What if we say 'happen to you' (or whatever it is we 've got to)? Or if we say to you how we'll feel when we 'm going to say it? Let's show you, shall we?|0
"I was so looking forward to watching the documentary self-immolation of the mastermind behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies I've ever seen. But the makers of ""Overnight"" - buddies (ex?) of the mastermind in question - also need to learn how to make a movie. Various unsavoury remarks, yelling obscenities into the phone, and enjoying his alcohol do indeed make Mr. Duffy look like a putz. But it doesn't shed any insight into why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what's Boondock Saints even about?"|1
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted . Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films that were directed and acted . I think you are right. It made my life much better. For me personally, it does not take more than 5 to 8 hours to make a movie. I do a lot of reading as well, and would recommend you a movie based on a movie. As for me, I do a lot of watching movies as well, so I think I would recommend you this movie to anyone looking to get a bit more out of their life.|0
"This really is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie. The further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their ""acting"". I viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering! The location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach. I suppose, that home-video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub-standard."|1
Now, lissen you guys, I LOVED THIS FILM, though not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING, another beloved John Milius epic. It was fun, a lot more than if it were based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a great yarn, with a whiff of political correctness. I love this film for its beautiful photography, its humor and its attenuated criticism of the Bad Guys (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spear- carriers for the acquisitive 'civilized' world, with their repeating rifles, artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor.|1
The mission to see the movie `` The Cave '' was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing all of the incredible things you could see in one movie. I was amazed by how many stars and movies there were! That is why I took this post to write a list of the most exciting things you will see in a movie. I also made a list of a few other things I did during the entire film so I will post them here as I think they will be of great interest to you. The first few things I did was create a playlist for a different playlist for this film.|0
Great acting , great production values , good direction.But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the subject matter. But it does the job with the pacing right out of the movie. I’m not sure if it was intentional or not. So what I’m going to do here is give you a better example that’s not based on an example of the script itself, but rather a look at some other examples. I used this for a quick review of the movie and I am looking forward to reading your review of that one too!|0
This film easily rivals the emotional strength , the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of `` 12 Angry Men, and a full-sized version of the same film for $25. We are going to take a deep dive into the history of this film and the first and second scenes, so let us know what we think of it. If you liked the trailer, you can still see the scene from the bottom. You can see the main character from the bottom. I can't say for sure but it's certainly one of the best I've seen of this film.|0
Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz . A young mother Selma Lidz ( Andie Brown , The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) was pregnant with her child. She and her daughter were sent to the police in New York. Their ordeal was captured during a raid in which they found and interrogated the daughter. She was shot, her body thrown into the subway. She and her daughter escaped but were eventually captured and shot dead. This is not a case where we will read it in the police file.|0
"For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to ""Rosemarys Baby"" is one big mistake. It starts off that Andrew/Adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is terrible as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and Dukes of Hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of Satan."|1
"I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in ""Tigerland"", and although his acting is wooden, he does portray a tough ""leader"" character. Same here. This movie was about a bunch of young, hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that one has to dive to see. The beginning scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. Flash forward 30 years, and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose."|1
"You thought after ""Traumschiff Surprise"" that German comedy can't get worse? It can. This comedy is yet another attempt at perpetuating stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but... The real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh-so-different from straight men. Absolutely silly, of course. Even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex. This movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men."|1
I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie. The way Michael Oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance I cannot bare. Junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father Ben madly insane. Also the Crazy Dance ride operator is not fair to Junior for not letting him go on the ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to Junior because she made threatening insults to Junior which is why I cannot tolerate this movie.|1
Received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label which specializes in art-house flics, they released Irreversible and a range of Bergman's opus.The thing that struck me about Alex Frayne's strangely titled film MODERN LOVE is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us into the mind of Mr Joe Average, replete with voices in the head, visions, and madness. It's set in rural redneck Australia, the film doesn't trivialise or praise the folks like so many Australian movies.|1
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.I have watched the original from it's early days on Big Girls Blouse to the last series on Channel seven. Kath and Kim was a great Mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get.However in this American version I found it to be dull, Molly Shannon is to fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm. While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original Kimmy wore.|1
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film, I felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. It supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the Mad Max franchise(bad idea). The casting was not exactly the best, I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent Toecutter!|1
"Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron , famous lovers of Hollywood movies like ""Star Wars and The Last Airbender"" . Would they have gone to the movies to see Lord Byron , famous lover of ""Star Wars and The Last Airbender"", ""The Last Jedi"" . Would they have stayed with the films to see Lord Byron , famous lover of Star Wars and The Last Airbender , best-loved romantic movie for the last decade , favorite movie from the first decade of the movie ? What about the original movie ""Star Wars: Episode II"" ?"|0
This film has its detractors, and Courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who, frankly, need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging, poignant, relevant. Finney, naturally, is larger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads, and Courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. The period is well captured, the supporting cast well chosen. This is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial.|1
So keira knightly is in it ... So automatically we compare this film to attonement . Aside rom the fact that this is a film that does its job well is that it is a comedy. This is what the majority of the cast does in this film. I wish I could explain how the film works well, and I really think that the film is not as bad as it sounds because it doesn't appear in many movies in the genre, as well as I have seen movies in the genre that have some great performances. But the film is a comedy.|0
Is this a good movie ? No , certainly not . But for Jolie lovers it 's must-have . Her role is one she'd have loved more than you could put on this film . But you would think it could make you cry . Oh yeah , that is so much less . And that's why . It was her role . It was a role she couldn't be bothered with . It's not like the rest of the movies . But if she was a woman , then she would have loved the idea . You could say . Well, I think so .|0
"* * May Contain Spoilers * * The main character , a nobleman named Fallon , is stranded on an ocean island with two other ships. In the background of the scene, Fallon's ship is also being used as an instrument of war, as a symbol of her devotion to the Allies. However, Fallon's crew is not the only one to come to the rescue and rescue Fallon. One of the main characters from the series who has a special bond with Fallon has a name for her character from the story: ""Dirty,"" and she is given the name ""Eve."""|0
"This movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. It fails at even this, since there's way too much ""plot"", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. Seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. The performances are C-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the Spec-Ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre East Coast/Venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct."|1
There must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie. In fact, in the film, the girl, Lizzy, didn't even appear depressed. She just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college, mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol. That seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mom seemed a little out there.|1
At the time of this writing ( January 25 , 2006 ) , I am saddened to hear of the recent tragic deaths of a number of people. The tragedy of their lives was not just the loss of those they love but also of their loved ones too. Some of the more than 1,700 deaths that we know of have been caused by violence against their loved ones and it is clear that this is a serious problem that is affecting everyone and it is the most urgent problem for everyone and in particular the people of the world.

From the crash of the opening theme , `` The Man With the Golden Arm '' is classic 1950 's political fantasy in its original form; it's not even close, but it was also a popular political platform in the '80s, in terms of popularity and popularity distribution, and as such could not be dated. In fact, by the early '90s, the genre was a more popular form of politics than any political issue in history, so the original style of the 1950s was just like the popular period in that year; the 1960s was a more successful time.|0
I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful , predictable , embarrassing movie even a 3 star Oscar nomination. For some reason, I couldn't get enough of it , I could only think of two reasons why. I thought it was the worst Oscar, because I didn't have any other Oscar nomination. Yes, I was in a horrible mood to watch this. But I have to believe that some one else, I might be the bad guy, could have given it to me. This is the first time I've ever seen it.|0
"Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry. Sure the plot is unlikely, but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film. Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather. Other great character actors play his card buddies. Jim Belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of Megan, part of the extended family.Faith, family, and marriage are respected. A few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor. And in the background that wonderful Dean Martin tune--""Return to Me."|1
Duncan Roy's writing and direction is really, and regularly, below par. Actually it sort of stinks. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd, contorted dialogue among the 'upper class' characters, at once idiotic and pretentious, amateurish, stilted to its core. Characterisiation and script - and sometimes the acting - is creaky like a school play...but worse, there's a sort of peacock self-certainty about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't grasped...he's just no good.|1
I actually liked certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really weren't bad, but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. The music was fine. The things I hated were: The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality.|1
"""I remember waiting to be born..."" ""Vision quest that was the American West."" ""We went to a psychic..."" ""I'm sure their first reaction is that she's cuckoo"" ""...the place is haunted..."" ""I think there's another dimension right here."" An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of New York and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in Death Valley. There, they renovated a theater--painting it is a very home-spun/folk art manner."|1
Mr. `` Uwe Fail '' strikes again , transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap . Poor boy , his father was a good person to help him fix it , and a good person to help make it better . '' He was good to be . '' He's a great person . ''He's not the kind of person who helps you change your way of thinking, but I believe you can change your mind and help make it better.''

I walked into a book store in Brentwood, Tennessee. I am not going to say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I have been satisfied with every item I purchased there before this one. On display in the front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (Might I mention this is the only store I have seen it for sale in.) I had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. I was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. I had great expectations for it.|1
This movie, with all its complexity and subtlety, makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen. The topics it addresses are ugly, cynical, and at times, even macabre, but the film remains beautiful in its language, artful with its camera angles, and gorgeous in its style, skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories, Tobias Wolff.Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie, I won't go into any details, other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself.|1
I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version . In my first attempt at creating the film and seeing it, I found the characters to be quite a bit flawed . But I think they made the story better. And, as someone said, the film was a great way to make a movie. But now, as time goes by, it gets better and better and, as I say, I am excited about this film as well. This is an amazing film. I hope it gets a lot of reviews .|0
Secret Service agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) has been assigned to protect the President-elect's wife, the new First Lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very difficult woman and Killion has his hands full. She is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the First Lady dead. This movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line, but also with the lack of realistic locations. For example, in the scene depicting the Inaugural Parade, the First Lady is in a Rolls Royce convertible with agent Killion and without the President.|1
Brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. Their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence.|1
"Just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie. This movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical ""junior high"" experience. They make learning anything at all seem completely taboo. I can't stand the fake French accents, or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually ""fall"" for the twins. Why am I putting everything in parenthesis? Because its all stereotyped. The twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy they even have a grandfather at all. How does this fit the Mary-Kate/Ashley mold?"|1
As I watched this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. The acting was horribly stifling, and it was Bad Acting. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. All around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse.|1
This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time . The kind of title that ruins the relationship between two men, and the way it has come to signify that a woman has a role to play, that she has the ability to choose for herself. The movie was written for women and men, and made with a male protagonist who has an idea, a role, and a goal to be created. He can’t even tell the difference between men and women in terms of a woman.|0
This could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film.The story takes place in a little-known country. You know, a small country. A little-known country. That’s how this movie ended. But there was a time before the movie. You see how the country has changed since the start. There is a change in the country, the way things are. The way things are. The way things are – and I mean that, the change in everything in the world in the movie was a big change.|0
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's team!! Well, at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington, DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys.|1
"Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance . Andrew Morton at the Fort Worth Star Telegram said on the matter:

There's no way they're going to have the UFC world at any given time. They just don't. “They just have to get things started and it’s going to happen right now. The UFC really don't have any plans of getting it started until the end of 2017. And if they do, it’ll be the UFC’s goal to get the UFC to where it’s at before the next season starts in 2018,"" said the fighter."|0
"While it's not ""perfect"", it's close. Love Barbara Stanwyck, SZ Sakall, Sidney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shayne (Superman's police chief), the housekeeper, the waiter at Restaurant Felix, and the judge......I can go on and on. This movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since I was a youngster, and my children grew up with it, too! ""The baby swallowed the watch"" was always my son's favorite line.Sexy Barbara Stanwyck in pants and gowns stole the show along with the cuddly, funny S. Z. Sakall."|1
"An absorbing exploration of virtual reality , although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended . There has been much speculation over how this would work , especially when there is an actual film to be shot

There is no word on whether the project could be completed in time frame of two years, but the director said at the time ""I would be delighted if you would be so happy to do it, because I would be satisfied with a film that is in a year or so. If it could be done, I would love to have a project that we all can enjoy."|0
I absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 years ago, and I was disappointed. But perhaps that was because I never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, I have to say it was no way better than number 5. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's PG-13. The acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects.|1
The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan . After a few weeks it was time to take my place, and I will be making a movie in the studio next week. This is the first time I am going to be making a film with my wife and I, and the other two will be watching with our two young daughters. I really want to show her and my husband and their kids that I have done the best I have done so far. This film has been on our minds for a year.|0
The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934 . I purchased this because I like desert films and would probably buy a few more later if I hadn’t stumbled upon it in the beginning. However, they’re so well made in that way that I might as well go back into it. I have no clue what happened, but the first few shots are pretty good too (I think the camera does an awful job). So what did they do that I had to go to bed?|0
Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids . Spanky and the gang will be in the next house. But I can't help but wonder if I ever will get the chance. I just went to the gym on my birthday and I got my high school dance. I don't think it made much of a difference who the party was, but I had to try it out on myself. I remember it being fun. I got to see a bunch of kids at school that were in the gym dancing. It was a great party.|0
Movies are n't always suppose to be about deep , provolking thoughts . Sometimes they 're simply meant to be fun , but there's nothing quite that comes into play with movies as a whole , or on a set that is full of silly things . That's also why movie posters are so funny , they 're about the things that people want to see . The movies are about the things , not just the movies . That's what makes movies so entertaining , not only because the movies are so funny . . . This is why I'm always interested in the movies .|0
This was a fantastic movie about two people, one a young teenage girl, and the other, a middle aged man, who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones.Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to. The script, although written by Gorman Bechard, seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie.The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless.|1
Hard Justice is an excellent action movie ! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does a good job on the main theme of the film , which is that people are killing each other at the point of contact with an enemy. This film had the same theme but the action was changed. There were a few moments that made it a little better to watch but none of the elements of the action acted out. If you enjoy the movie and enjoy the film, please like and share this post with your friends to keep up with all the movies you love in your local library.|0
"This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying ""everyone has a box"" which he put his personal things into."|1
I can not believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage ! The acting was so poor , my landlord is very bad , but now she will not give me rent !! I have had a lot of bad things happen this month , but this is the biggest one I got and the best one I could ever imagine ! Please, if you cannot give me any more ! please don’t give me any ! This is a very good sign. I will not buy you any new clothes. I will just get out my bag and do the shopping, if I have time.|0
"This movie is on cable sporadically, and I never really watched it, thinking it would be similar to the Bruce Willis film ""Ïn America"", with the usual trite story about American freedom, etc. But it was not; it was so much more!.Of course, Martin Sheen is excellent; (I have never seen him in a movie I haven't loved, even if the script is bad, because he is so talented). Kathy Bates is the overbearing mom, and does a great job."|1
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid. I loved it. Whilst I haven't watched it recently, I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today. Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion) , the robbers and the nuns. This nice humour style is much missed these days.|1
I attended a screening of 'The Cooler ' at the Toronto Film Festival this year . While the other reviews were good, the other screenings were still bad. One of them, I'm afraid, was an actual film, and it seemed to lead to a lot of negative publicity for the event. I just couldn't take that in. When I arrived in Toronto City, there were too many screenings, too many critics, and too many people going off on their own about what was going to happen in the future.|0
"Was excited at the opening to hear part of ""Chevaliers De Sangreal"" but wanted more so I bought said Hans Zimmer piece. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the ""God Particle"" or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. Who doesn't love Hanks?"|1
What a crap that movie is . The script is simply non existent . The movie at times seems like the worst that the internet ever was . All I do is watch the movie . That is all . But I don’t know if I would agree or disagree with your point . The reason I would agree is because of how it is possible to see the characters and the way the game plays in a video game . It’s just so easy to see and understand . It doesn’t require the mind . I’m just a reader .|0
I did have some expectations from this film because 1 . It was a Yash raj production 2 . When I read the first post, it was like this: “I know you said this was a Jain film, and I don’t agree with the fact that it was so far from the Jain tradition. I am sorry, but this is a film that could be more than a little better. It is based on the story of a young boy who meets an interesting girl and finds out he is the head of the family.|0
"Filmmaker Bryan Forbes , who once displayed a light , sardonic touch with beguiling material such as `` Whistle Down The Window''' and was also a great performer, he became one of the leading composers of 1980s Western music, as well as being one of the most talented and versatile pianists of the early 1980s. He performed on a variety of international and international recordings for the West and in the UK. He won a Juno award for best original concert performance in 1979 for his ""Stairway to Heaven"" piece. The piece made him the first composer to win a Juno award."|0
"One of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in ""Wink Of An Eye"", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS."|1
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan 's role of SARKAR , but am disappointed . Being a Ramadhan , one of the best-known actors in all of Hindi movies , I think it would be a great honor for all the actors to be on the screen in the role of SARKAR . I am glad to see that it is finally getting back to how the movie was created. I have watched the movie in various theaters, and I can tell that SARKAR is being made by Ramadhan as an actor , and I am a fan of Ramadhan.|0
"Go to the video store and get the original. I do not understand why Hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it. ""Mostly Martha"" or ""Bella Martha"" has a much better cast. Beginning with the heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, to the Italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt, not fit for child-rearing. In many ways, the American version of the movie is a copy of the German original."|1
What a crappy movie ! The main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in a castle in the middle of the night in the summer with his wife, who was killed by an alien invasion. The show was supposed to be the story of two different races and the show’s main theme was about love and war. I was disappointed that the movie’s plot was simply too much. The only thing in the movie was an alien invasion. To make things worse, there were so many other elements to the story that had nothing to do with the main story.|0
Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes , a hard-working guy doing what he loves , there is no easy way to get him to make the next move. You know it is easy. You just have to make the move. The best way to do it is for Sykes to work his way to the top. If there are more moves than he makes, you can say it is easy, but in reality Sykes has made it tough on the player and not the man. There are many ways that you can learn from the past, but you can do a lot more with the current situation.|0
i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York.there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score, it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though.|1
This one was truly awful . Watching with fascinated horror , I kept on asking `` why have they done this ? Because it was so wonderful and so awful I couldn't tell my parents for the moment. The movie is pretty funny . When I watched it some time ago and it was funny I think about the horror movie itself. And I remember feeling like I was reading a story about the movie. I was watching it in the theater and I thought about the horror story . I remembered that movie and it was pretty horrible.|0
"Korea's answer to ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" follows a similar story route to its American counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate, a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one. Who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea?Originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and scary."|1
Bad, bad, and did I mention bad? Aside from the comical monster terrorizing the workers the funniest part of the movie was when surveyors are in the desert and one comments that they have an hour of daylight left, but you can clearly see by their shadows, and the bright sky, that it's probably only 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about consistency. READ THE SCRIPT director!The only cool part of this movie, besides the rack on Clara Bryant of course (as another reviewer mentioned), is the phantom skeleton horse that the Bone Eater rides on.|1
Unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie , I 'm really not the much of a Cynthia Rothrock and she 's more concerned with the way the characters play themselves (it is a great movie to watch) rather that they play their own characters, and I think they 're doing something right by making the characters more relatable to their own audience. I love the fact that it was directed by James Marschall, who also directed his own movie. But it would appear that they don't really know how to put it on the screen and what the characters are doing in real life.|0
For several reasons, this movie is simply awful. Other posters have listed some of this movie's historical errors. Well, I have a layman's knowledge of Roman history and even I found the inaccuracies flagrant. I usually forgive errors in historical movies because I understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate. And shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some, let's say, historical license. But this movie goes well beyond mere rounding.There's worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing.|1
"A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel ""Waltz into Darkness"" of the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, i.e. your love to any person and the love you received from him/her. A wealthy man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat still young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent."|1
My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot)...so I rented it. Then I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 Oscars. GREAT! this should be good ol' drama. This movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. But once the movie ended, I couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just couldn't tolerate her character at all.|1
I've read the positive comments on this movie. I assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why I watched this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed even once during the duration of this film. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was off.|1
Even though this film's trailer and poster imply that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I might not have been as shocked to discover she was just a minor (and I do mean Minor) character if this movie was suppose to being told by Sally's very own family! I mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that has been ignored by history, would you really tell it with the man who relegated her to obscurity at the main character? His other lover (who happens to be white) as the actual love interest?|1
"So bad , it 's entertaining , especially during cocktail hour , and believe me , you 'll need a lot more than that, especially after a long weekend on the weekends . . . you'll have to try a bit more than that. It's a really long weekend , so it's a good time to have a look at the website . . ,

I can't stress enough that it has made my day , it's been very enjoyable, and I feel like I had a bit of a good night's sleep before the party . . ."|0
Mark Walhberg in a great role , idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs , but has no idea that he is just one. I like the way this song is sung, especially if you have to listen to this album, I have to say I can’t wait to hear this song on my computer. And I’m not trying to sound like I do or anything, but it really feels like a great song. And for those who are new to the genre, I like the way the song plays.|0
I do n't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in , but I guess you can use your brain power to decide for sure. The movie is about a teenage girl who gets stuck in her parents' back yard. She's living with her parents when the school bus comes around. But before she meets her ex-boyfriend, the bus driver, she goes in search of some help. At this point her parents have a discussion about what it takes to get her to the school bus.|0
This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel. Here is how the movie starts, Women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is A OK as long as it only targets soldiers (In case your wondering, Men) However the virus back fires (Big shock)and all the men on earth slowly die. Then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man.|1
I was attracted to this film by its offbeat , low-key , 'real life ' story line . That is, I'd never been into 'reality' before but that was a big part of the reason why I liked it and the film is one of the best I've ever seen , and I hope that I can use it as a lesson in why I want to spend so much time in a movie . It's a comedy and a great film it's what makes it great . It gives me a lot of joy and fun .|0
I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script.|1
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing. All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can't stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). Dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) don't compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work.|1
One of my all-time favourite movies. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time. It's still enjoyable second and third times round but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. If you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film.|1
"After a meteorite lands in ""Boston"" (really somewhere in the Isle of Man), a hideous, fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school, causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie-like creatures. This film is apparently a loose (and I stress loose) remake of the 1986 film with the same name, as it features the same monster but a different plot. Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. This isn't."|1
"Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: ""Police Squad - in color"", you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom.Also to kill off a ""Guest Star"" and then never refer to him again, where had you ever seen that before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention, you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry."|1
This is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. It doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. Still, it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). In Red valley, Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead.|1
"I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl at heart. There are not any movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst thing in it was when one of the boys said ""stupid"". I applaud them for stepping out and making a true family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and know looking to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can not stop talking about it. It goes along with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this one."|1
"When I first saw this show i thought to my self "" What is this!!!!!?"" Its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered ""huge"". Then there's Sadie. This complete misfit for her friends and well her family. Shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another Lizzie Miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!)"|1
A fairly interesting look at some characters from India 's burgeoning middle class . Although India is rapidly modernizing , many of these characters seem to still exist in India today. While I have been using a lot of language here, I do not believe that such language exists in many places. So to give you a sense of why I have come across two different languages, let's see them both in the context of one another. Let's first look at English and Hindi in India in the context of this book.|0
"Although it isn't mentioned very often, ""Don't Look in the Basement"" is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired at Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens, after he is murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if she's hiding something...This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about, and have sympathy for during the climax, which doesn't happen very often in horror films."|1
I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.First off let me say the acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose. Patsy Kensit is so-so but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her Hotel Room is utterly meaningless rubbish. Ms Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this film.|1
"I cannot stress how bad this movie is. This director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so ""distressed"". Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head? You should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life Buddy Giovinazzo.I take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why are they yelling so much? Why is everyone so mean?"|1
"The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960's Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene. The stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers; however for the film director Milos Foreman (who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more ""user friendly"" for the big screen."|1
"This movie must be exported to the rest of the world ! An absolute masterpiece , with a both bizarre cast and a hilarious premise! I hope this review will make you laugh out loud! :oo

If you are looking for an excellent review by a talented author, please check out my reviews. As of today, my rating is 1.9, so this is only a 1.5/5 rating.. I also hope that this is a good movie, and this could be a good movie, too. I would recommend this movie for all the movies I watch."|0
WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.If you plan on attending the film then you might have some of the comments below. I have a friend who wants this film as a way of showing her love for the movie and he has done some of the artwork for this film. I have seen the video on YouTube which I had seen before and I have posted the artwork. However it seems that they are looking at her artwork and are making a copy of it.|0
"This movie really starts strong . We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke-Cola problems, so this movie is for sure going to Australia, so we want to get some pictures from it and make sure that this movie will be a good one. If you are going to buy it, why not read this? He is a hotshot in America

A big thank you to you all, Mr. Roberts! You guys helped us make a good movie. Thanks also to everybody for giving us permission to read it!"|0
TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection . They take up most of the back screen and the content, especially the video on the top right side of your screen , and take up as many as 10 seconds for the video that is the main focus . If you are using Windows XP it may not be the most important part of the screen , and the most important part is the video playback. You can use it as a backup for any video you save and/or use for backups.|0
"This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV . I own all 9 seasons on this show. The show is based on a book written by John Steinbeck , which I wrote in the late 70s by a friend. It's worth reading:

One of the main points of the book was that if you don’t get paid, you end up with a pay-per-view and you’ll never see it on your own show. But this book is a great book that anyone could read and watch. There is also a whole section called ""What’s New for TV?"""|0
Terror in the Jungle is a real find . If you saw it , you 're one of the few people who will actually understand what I'm about to point out! When you walk through the jungle with my friend, you find yourself in a place that has become so far too big, it can't be more than ten miles away. Not that there's much room in the world in this small area. However, when you come back here, you'll find there are still a few people standing there, so it's a little hard to make out what's happening.|0
This was a pathetic movie. The Alien was decent, but the movie itself gave a new meaning to pitiful. The plot is something that's been done over and over again! However, this one does it the worst! The acting was c**p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was going on. No one developed any concern for the main character. The movie was far too slow paced, and the murder scenes that there were were foolishly crafted and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the movie.|1
Larry Bishop, the Writer/Actor/Director, focuses too heavily on the camera, music, and visuals. The film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the film's start to finish, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. The hell with the ride. The film is a bomb.The Victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. They are bikers, anti-heroes, and protagonists.|1
As one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say awful? The script was so weak, using cliche after cliche. It seems as though the writers pieced this story together with a few articles on Enron. Watching the movie, we honestly were able to complete about half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. I realize this was supposedly adapted from a book, but was the book this bad? I don't know what to say. Just terrible.|1
Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good.|1
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives in the island to get married with Louis, he waits for her in the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie that is missing.|1
This movie was sooo bad. It wasn't even funny at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumbs down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another or two. Chris Kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. He has a jealous girlfriend, who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who Chris has eyes for.|1
I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does.|1
This movie has an outstanding acting, by Marilia Pêra, and a stunning dicretcion by the argentine Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian movie ever made. The movie was filmed with child from the 'favelas' , the brazilian ghetos. The children weren't actors and were casted by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children that are arrested in the correctional prison, that looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately this is not purely fiction, in Brazil it does happen till today.|1
Chop Shop . Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart ) . Bahrani specializes in character driven action scenes that take you up on your journey to the future and explore the possibilities of the universe. This film was made using a 3D rendering technique, based on the original story, and was based on the art direction of Bahrani. The original story has been restored and re-animated. It was originally based on the original story and has become very popular with children and adults. It has been shown to be the work of Bahrani since it was first released as a series.|0
This movie had an excellent premise, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, attitudes to women at work and male female relations in England early last century. However, it simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse, is that the love story was totally unbelievable. The acting was for the most part poor, the direction confusing, but most of all the screenplay and the story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. I really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out.|1
"No pun intended. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story, but it's safe to assume that you already know, what kind of character the main actor portrays. And of course being a priest while being ""naughty"" exaggerates all that. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.If you have seen Wook's previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface, it still has quite some heat hidden underneath."|1
If this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been jailed. While Adrian Lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid running afoul of the Child Pornography Protection Act of 1996, a woman dumps Ripe on us and everyone applauds. Did I miss a meeting? In addition to the blatant pedophilia, this movie is utterly preposterous. Has this woman never set foot on an active military base? Has she never met a soldier? Whose army is this?|1
"This movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie . Unhappy 'easterners ' are not pleased with any of the actors , they don't think they will be a part of it
. One time a girl was on a train and had no idea what to do . She went to her room and found that her sister was asleep . She thought this was because she didn't realize she was so close . A boy who was trying to do right by his parents . A man who has never seen an Indian girl cry . A child who knows he is a little boy ."|0
"This is the first porn I've ever tried to review. It demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. ""I'm American. I'm a prudish virgin."" ""We are European. We are cultured and sex-mad."" ""It is nice when we all screw each other."" Lots to talk about! Well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions."|1
This is a totally awesome movie! If you haven't seen it yet, you damn well should. Sure, the plot is slow to develop, the special effects are laughable, the acting is ridiculous and the action is badly choreographed, but as wrestler DDP would say; That's not a bad thing....that's a good thing! Everything about this movie is hilarious, especially if you get the dubbed version, which has even worse actors. It's countless laughs until you get to the end, yearning for the sequel, where the mummy fights wrestling women.|1
This is one odd film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual innuendos. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting, but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched, but then again, the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line.The cast are good though, Meg Foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader, with the handsome A.J.|1
"This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highway and, of course, plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course. The actors are the best reason to see ""Black Day, Blue Night."" There is the late, great J.T. Walsh (""Swing Blade,"" ""Pleasantville,"" ""Red Rock West,"" ""The Last Seduction,"" and many more), who did many neo-films noirs (See also ""Breakdown"")."|1
As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I never had an experience of my own, I still have a fascination for the TV show, and to me, Dr Who is still just as entertaining to watch. I'm not just a science fiction fan, and I find that I'm just as fascinated as the Doctor, though I do not have to worry about whether my curiosity is justified at all. It's always fascinating to watch a show that is well received and well thought of.|0
Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy , insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous ; and it all comes at the very end of a game in which he decides to have his revenge on the villain of the last two games. If you've read this far, you'd like to know a little more about this story. This game is set in a time when the world is being turned upside down, people are dying, and everything in here is dying. This is what happens. The world is being transformed.|0
I 'm not sure where to start with this . In short , it was a disappointing movie . Having had this many years since it first came out I thought the story was too far dated . In addition it was a very well acted movie . I think it was very good and if you really want to see the movie try to see this movie . It's funny because if you were going to watch it as a joke . But it's the funniest movie I've seen . Its funny . When you see it you have to imagine that the movie is a parody of reality .|0
The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast . The quality of the camera work makes it a stand out choice for all ages and is a shame that you can’t really say anything to anyone at the beginning . You might be surprised at how much of the scenes are shot in the movie, but once they get to the point where they are well done you know it’s not going to last for a long time . That was the reason why the film is so much more enjoyable than most of these movies .|0
Well , this is new ... Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director, and is known for his work as a young film director in his first feature-length movie in the works of Luciano Fulci. In his film, which is about a group of young girls trying to get their way after the death of a beloved, the film's main character, Lucio Fulci. He has directed the film in two different roles as a director, one for a feature-length feature film film. He is also a producer and director, making the shorts which I have seen.|0
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning . Well I was drawn to the fact that I was going to be teaching in high school but I knew that I would need some time. I wanted to go out on the campus for a few more hours . . . but of course it did not matter what time of day I went out . . . when I was going out I was told that I was supposed to go into the gym , but I wasn't supposed to go where the students were going . . .

"I've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read "" better than save private ryan""....mmmmm ...i thought cool! guys....is just a ridiculous movie. Almost fun. Nothing to do with a proper war movie. I want my money back! Why the f...k the peoples lies??????????? F NO SUBTITLES They tried to make everything cooler with the light....but they didn't make it. Sorry about this.....but the movie is awful."|1
Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane), who was one of the show's guest stars. The series was followed by a third edition. They were released later that year with a limited edition, but was not released on the DVD release of that show. The series was released in a limited number of DVD sets, with an additional bonus disc in which he appeared as a recurring character. He did not make it on any of the subsequent DVDs. The series has since been released in pre-emptive territories.|0
"I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game , HUGE fan . It still holds a place in my heart and I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it! I hope it works great, but I am happy that it is working better than I can ever dream of. So if you wish to support it, go ahead! :)

I have just started playing the game myself ( I am not a gamer , just a person who likes to play games ) And if this game can not work then I don’t think that I can play it."|0
"SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! ! This was my son 's review of the movie , which he wanted me to see. It's one of those things you can do to make your house look great, just look at it and think ""Oh boy, I like it!"" I do, but he wants to do something that would make a better movie. He wants me to put some money in it . . . and it's so good . . . I've been thinking about this, and I'm sure it'll be nice to put some money ."|0
If you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film . . . you just have to wait . . . to see a zombie film. You've probably heard of the horror movie that was made about a group of kids at a local orphanage. One of the most popular of the horror movies of the time was The Evil Dead, in which the children were taken in by a monster, and their memories and emotional state were recorded. It's no wonder then, horror movies that aren't just for kids.|0
"I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on ""Mystery Science Theater"" have received a tons of low ratings on IMDb. However, a few of the films featured on the films weren't that bad and it's not fair to rate a film that's been given the ""MST"" treatment--with the hosts making funny comments during the film. Now I am NOT saying that ""The Girl in Lover's Lane"" is a great film, but it's not nearly bad enough to merit its current IMDb score of 2.1.The film begins with Bix and Danny meeting."|1

After five years in prison , Tony le Stéphanois ( Jean Servais ) meets his dearest friends Jo ( Carl Furek ) and David ( Jürgen Horne ). After two years in the police station, they discover they are being sent back to prison and they realize that there is another reason why Tony is being taken to court. After the trial, the three friends return to prison together to be sentenced to twenty-one years in prison. In January 2019, Le Stéphanois was released on parole for three years behind bars, after the police found evidence of his crimes.|0
"I watched this movie which I really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end. The problem I think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many bad ""effects"" which got me annoyed through the film. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. This film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end."|1
Without saying how it ended , it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes into one hour, that is to say from the time it was in the car to the time the car was driven off. And it was the last half hour. That was that. And then we would get out of the car and it wouldn't go off. So, the car kept going. It got really slow. It was the car that was going to go off, and I don't know how to describe it . . .|0
First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so forth. In this last part (hopefully) of the series I just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes... now vampires seem like besieged victims of bad pest control problem. They look and act like haughty white pasty humans. Some ideas were neat... the whole thing with human nobles was interesting. Pity the acting was abysmal. The slave thingy too was feasible.Other things just hit me as pathetic.|1
I feel that this movie is different from so many others in that it shows a family of girls who are in love, and they are trying to get rid of it, but we don't want that. In reality they just need a new movie. So I can't say they're wrong. If I were the director of a movie, they'd make it look like a movie. We don't care about what people think and they want something new. We don't care if they want it.|0
Well , this movie is really `` PLUMPED '' HAHA Get it ? Thats kinda like the attitude of this movie, you know. So the film really does look like the director has some big ideas here, it's really great. In fact if you look at it in the cinema, you can see some very cool things there that you can only dream of. That's how you do it, if you try to make it. You know, there's a great film here where the director has to be very careful to make the most of what you want.|0
I'm not sure whether i like this film or not. I think it is creepy and completely weird.Crispin Glover as always gave a great performance as Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but i don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves performance was really good, and i truly felt for his character. Over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real. I disliked some, but genuinely felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves).|1
Hey guys and girls! Don't ever rent, or may God forbid, buy this piece of garbage. I have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. The acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the Oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc.|1
This was a nice film. It had a interesting storyline, that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film. The storyline kinda reminded me of The City of God. But this one is done in a more nicer way in comparison. It had what i really loved:a tinge of surrealism. Some pretty interesting cinematography (thru the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it definitely widens you're view of south Africa. The actors were good (for 1st timers, most of them anyway), i especially liked Estelle character, which made this movie pretty enjoyable.|1
Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. The character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. Nichols, who is one of daytime TV's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl.|1
Earth Final Conflict began like a new world , a new vision from the creator of Star trek , something we have to live for. It is time to find our heroes and bring them back from the brink of chaos. This is the next chapter in the series of events in Star Trek that will lead to a world where they will face the forces of life. After a long series of conflicts, it’s time to go back to a different world. It is time to face the world of Star Trek again, and what’s to come in the future.|0
Wow , I was told this would be a B movie worth watching . I feel that I was misled . But if you really want it to look like this it will make a good film , if you are in love with a good B movie , you should get to watch it . This will make the B movie a better movie , if you really want to see a movie made out of love with the B movie , you should get to see the film . This would also make B films that make the B movie a good movie.|0
Some movies you'll watch because they touch your soul or challenge you in ways that grow.Some you'll watch because you want to be exposed to adventure or shock outside your experience; these won't directly feed you, but they'll help you situate yourself in a larger world than you otherwise would have. And after all, the hard parts of life are in what you choose not to accept.And then there are movies that do neither of these things, that you will watch out of obligation, or because you have a need for historical context.|1
This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie , but apparently none of this is really so. Here, Michael Jordan tells us that, of course, this makes the movie even more dangerous. In this case, however, because there's actually nothing on the screen for the camera, we're not talking about a movie in which the entire story takes place in front of the screen. Rather, we are talking about something that we've seen before, a movie that is more terrifying.|0
this is one of the stupidest movies ever, not THE stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest. This is 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. Probably Jim Varney's worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for. On the other hand, if you are a die hard Jim Varney/Ernest fan, then like me, you must add this film to your collection. It does have brief, rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between.|1
This film was a wonderful romp, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and a tremendous energy. The famous film director (the protagonist) and the events he tries to manipulate through film all become entangled in fascinating ways as he is nearly out-maneuvered by a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderfully rich images throughout and paths suggested but not followed (exactly what is going on with the somber wife of the pedestrian tourist wedding director?). The ending is so much the better for being untidy.|1
As a big Jim Carey fan I took my seat in the cinema with optimism . After all , Fun fact-checking would be a great first step for me to help you. And yes , I know I said “no” during the interview, but I did. It was fun and I had to laugh at that “fun fact”! So I’ll take a moment to remind you how important you can be to your colleagues . I have no idea what to tell you . I was introduced to your first name when you were a very small child .|0
If you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then I can imagine giving it a good rating... but I cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others (such as the way Paulie treats the teachers who try to help her) is anything you would want to teach your children. Yes, it's also bad the way Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life?|1
The first season of Bones is playing in Finland and I can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy.It's a poor mans' CSI. Or actually, CSI without coherent plot. Although Bones has potential, it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. It's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought.|1
Wow -- this movie was really bad ! You talk about formulaic , typical movie plot ? Watching this movie is like watching something terrible and it was bad . It was bad I don't know why. I guess it just looked bad but this film was not bad and it was really bad. But now I'm watching it I'm really sad because it was bad . Now I know it was bad but now I've read that it was bad and now I'm here , I think it was really bad . Why are people so sad?|0
Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line . Navy Commander Chuck Prescott ( Marshall Thompson ) has developed the plan to attack the British Isles, with a plan to launch a new fleet . The British are interested in the North Sea fleet . He believes that the new Royal Navy is ready to take the action . He does not believe in the threat he has created , but rather his plans to launch new fleet . With a new fleet . There are several ships he is interested in. He says his fleet has to have at least one new vessel, one or both, ready to take the action.|0
"If you can stomach the campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. It did for me, at least. I'll only mention one of my favorite elements: the ""underwater shots"" of the ""fish"" ""swimming"". The sound which accompanies those shots is great too.One last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as ""The Greatest American Hero"" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since."|1
"Okay, so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. Good for him! Now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. ""Hell Ride"" isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived Grindhouse cinema formula in general."|1
"To be honest , I did never read one of the comics and can not remember part 2 and 3. I have seen some other comics, but I haven't seen that one yet. It is possible that one of them may be the only one that will be published. They may have been written by artists or artists who would have made the comic, but that is not the point of comics. I know of multiple comics published in each year. I hope someone has some comics to look out for in the future. A:

I can't quite tell."|0
"I 've seen a few bad action movies in my days , but this one 's just plain awful . In my day, movies are a must. They provide the viewer with a visual experience that is unlike anything I've ever experienced before . For example, I've seen several good movies (in the movie ""Piggyback"" , I can't wait to see one) and the only bad one has not been in a major motion pictures. I know a few guys who made a movie in that kind of a movie but I've never seen any bad one before."|0
This movie is funny in more ways than one . It 's got action . It 's got humour . It 's got characters and there are a lot of people . It 's got the right of way . The movie has some serious moments . It is interesting . It has a lot of action . But the funny part of it is the fact that there are a lot of characters and then there are more characters. It is very funny . I got the title of my class at school when I was playing the lead character. I didn't really remember how I had been playing that.|0
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. Toshiharu Ikeda, who directed the superb MERMAID LEGEND and the seminal Japanese splatter film, EVIL DEAD TRAP, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise.A miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. Predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues.The staple of roman porno is sex. And sex mixed with violence. Both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh.|1
"A CBS radio program entitled ""We the People"" assists in finding an American home for Vienna refugee Charles Coburn (as Karl Braun), a skilled surgeon and pool hustler. He arrives with beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (as Leni), who is ""studying"" to become a nurse. Relocated to a small, dusty Midwestern village, they are welcomed at the station by burly John Wayne (as John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (as 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian. Ms. Gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl, and wants to leave. Immediately."|1
Bad , bad , movie , so bad it is worth watching . As long as you watch this movie, you will think it is a pretty good film so far . You will not even know this movie is a very poor movie , so . If you look at it as an example , you will find a movie with a lot of action . You will find a movie with a lot of action so far . But it is easy to see that . As it is, this movie is pretty bad . And it makes sense for you to watch this movie , because you will think .|0
"I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I just fell for it and I’ll never again have to watch a film like this because there is nothing else on the Internet to make me want to watch, so to say, “That was wonderful.”

So to summarize it, I would say that if this film had made you love it, that would have been a great film. But if the film had done you love it, you wouldn’t. So to say that this film hasn’t made you love it."|0
The storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park . The filmmakers did have their way with this story because it is one of two movies they wanted to go to in the same year, but it wasn't just the Jurassic Park Movie. According to the trailer for the movie, it was also the first movie that the filmmakers actually wanted to go to. So we are told that this is a Jurassic Park movie, but I thought that’s how we got to the trailer.|0
That is the answer . The question is : What is the single reason to watch this movie ? I am very happy to hear there is an explanation to make a movie of this kind. This time I want to make it a little easier to do. For some reason I made it for the only reason I wanted it so that I can just make it and have it to play in the movie. For the first half of the movie I want to make it with all my problems. I have already seen a good deal of them made.|0
The only reason i did n't delete this movie after 20 min is because we already wasted 20 minutes on this movie to play with. The other reason i want to delete was that we had already spent 20 minutes on this movie to play with, i want to avoid having to play it with. Anyway i have done that and now when i get a movie it plays with it in the middle, and i'm getting the movie to play with. the movie is still not working at the moment. i hope this helps.|0
One should not be too critical about the director's second feature.I really like the camera work of Madiba. As Mr. Shawn pointed out, he had a unique way of looking at things.However, howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? Remember he has not got any education of any sort. I don't think english is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Worse still, Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14.Any way, if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities, you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work.|1
The greatest tragedy man faces is that , capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this point, however, we can only conclude that the God’s gift of the mind is at the heart of each of man’s emotions. If we say this to one man’s brain, I believe we should read “He is the Lord’s messenger of God”. For that matter, I’m pretty sure I’d read it myself. What do I have to go on? Here’s what I have to say.|0
If good intentions made a film great , then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. Now if you want to know why this film was a success, here it is, in its own word, The Golden Globe Award winning “Goldman Sachs’ Golden Globe for “Best Feature Film of the Year”. However I would suggest that you get a better sense of the film than you probably can by reading this article, because you need to remember that there are many reasons why “Golden Globe’s” films have been successful.|0
I 'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park 's Thirst is exceptionally well made , but spending over two hours at it, you still need to spend more. It is very small, but you will be surprised how little you spend when you return to Chan-wook Park . It is very comfortable to drive to Thirst , and when you drive to one of its restaurants you can get in the car and enjoy all the food. There are two other restaurants in the park . One is on the west side of the street.|0
"The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 ""Musical Thriller"" SWEENEY TODD, a Gothic, gory, grisly, yet delicious musical concoction about a demented barber who returns to London to exact revenge on the evil Judge who not only had him permanently exiled from London, but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to ""shield her from all the evils of the world."" The barber finds love,sympathy, and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where Todd is concerned."|1
"Is there a fire fighter cliché that is NOT used in this film? From the opening line ""I'm getting too old for this"" through the ""antics"" of the firemen, to the ""worrisome wife"" the loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the final funeral for the fallen brethren, this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at Disney (""Our studies show that audiences really like it when..."" and then they stuck it in).There is nothing original here."|1
Okay , When I bought this flick I though this got ta be the ultimate b-movie , space monkey landing. The thing is , I found this movie at some other movie theaters (not the ones you go to) and I have to say if you go to any of them you don’t know what this flick is or not. You’d find it in the movies they have on YouTube and/or in movies of course. So, what is this movie about and why don’t you go to any of these theaters and watch it in your face?|0
Once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, Hollywood pictures. Fast Forward to the late 1960's, age, alcoholism, and all-around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress. Now a hasbeen, Miss Lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers(? ), Joan Crawford, and Bette Davis, and fall back on good ol' reliable Horror. But Flesh Feast? Really?|1
"Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - can't afford to miss Sergio Martino's gut-busting ""L'isola degli uomini pesce"" (called ""Screamers"" in the United States). Here's the lowdown: some shipwreck survivors land on an uncharted Caribbean island in 1891. The island is inhabited by a landowner, a scientist (Joseph Cotten) and his daughter (Barbara Bach). Sure enough, it turns out that the landowner is making the scientist create a race of fish-men."|1
"A film, first and foremost, should be good storytelling. It should be entertaining - and entertaining doesn't necessarily mean ""laughs"", and it doesn't necessarily mean ""light"". It basically means you're not bored while watching it. As brilliant as 2001 may be, it is a difficult film to watch, especially for the current (video-game-playing/iPod fumbling) generation. Its slow pace and the sometimes intolerable amount of time it takes for an actor to perform a single action (e.g. the attempt to rescue the crew member floating in space) will stretch your patience."|1
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture ! ! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning , it's really interesting to see the effect of what I'm watching . I can't understand how that happened to us , what we were watching and why it changed our story . We watched the chopper and the music but now I understand that they just made us watch it . We loved the chopper scene and how it felt and I'm glad we watched it . I really want to try to give it the same love it has received in a very similar fashion but I think that it is just the opposite .|0
The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so great that it became the theme music for the TV show IRON CHEF (though it is WAY overused and too intrusive in the movie). So, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. And the dialog?! What person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the STUPID macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? You get much greater realism from most cartoons!|1
I walked into Blockbuster , itchin ' to watch some good old fashion action movies . So i browsed around online and there ' was a lot of interesting stuff online . So when my friends ' saw my website i asked them ' if they could ' go online and if they could ' do so ' , i know i'm not doing too much. So that ' , ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' I looked over my shoulder and i saw the following: ' I ' ' ' ' ' the website , ' which is a lot of interesting .|0
I realise it 's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie ( which was grandiosely released with the original soundtrack) I was watching it on my TV the other day, as I was watching it and then watching it on TV for the first time, and it really got me thinking and trying to decide whether it's good or not and whether it was my favourite to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it. If you have ever been watching the movie and you have a TV you're watching, that's how much you can enjoy it.|0
This movie clearly has an agenda , which could be summed up like this : Never , never cross the river , but you will always be on the wrong side of history. But I also know that you know what happens if you’ve never made it on this map in your life. It doesn’t matter how much money you make on the map and you have never made it on the map for any reason. And I’ve done it for the first time. I mean, that’s a very nice map I’ve made in my life.|0
I can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film, so I must be in the minority for liking this film so much. Well, I am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). I guess I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character played by Ryan. While he truly is dangerous as well as VERY menacing, you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma. And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man!|1
Sometimes, things should just not be made. And while the set-up seemed good enough, it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror. But the problem is, its not another Saw film. Its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from Jason Voorhees.I lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the film. And generally, it flopped in its attempts. True, telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first, but that grew tiring to watch.|1
This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating. If you're trying to impress some cute little ninjette I would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. Its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot.Also I was wondering, where does a Teal ninja hide? Are ninjas color coded like this? Is this normal? If I were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas I would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword.And I finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was multiple choice, It went pretty good.|1
This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. It's a classic and trite sports theme.|1
When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice, as my original intent was sold out. what ensuited then was sheer terror, this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it. the story is not worth mention, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who - on discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays, the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues... it is absolutely astonishing that actors as dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense.|1
Gordon Scott with his well coiffed hair, hourglass figure and weird pidgin English has to be the worst of all the Tarzans. As for the other actors in this mess, they're on a par with any 4th grade elementary school drama class. I've seen Used Car Dealers in TV commercials who can act better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (the dull Eve Brent) get her lipstick and eyebrow pencils in the jungle? I realize these were made for kids but Wow! The plot line seemed OK but the director should have required more from his actors.|1
"Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. In other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed by Pacino because he became a promoter of the ""F"" word also. This might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. I don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this."|1
Firstly, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. Secondly, few women professors are sleeping with dorm cooks. Thirdly, few brassy coeds have a dad who cooks in their dorm. Fourthly, once a SECOND member of a college small-group project team meets a violent demise, the college PRESIDENT will disband the whole class, and NOT turn a blind eye as the professor merrily steers the rest of the group toward grisly deaths. Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the mundane content of this film to truly appreciate how much this flick really sucks!|1
How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. There is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie. How they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling. I didn't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all.|1
Solo is a poor film - that can not be ignored . The acting for the most part is very amateurish . I would have said the director was superb, but the film is a farce . And if you look at the performance of the main characters, the performances in a lot are very mediocre . There are also bad actors in the films, who have a lot on their plate . And that's just the main problem with them all . I will definitely watch the films . And I can assure you that if they are not good, they will be in trouble.|0
I love old `` monster movies '' for the pure camp value . This one does not disappoint if you look at them from the right side of the screen ! You get the point. I just want to say ... this movie comes close to that point ... it is a shame it has not been made on time and we have to wait and see it ! It also comes close to what the movie did in terms of quality, especially because it was based on a comic book. They did not have such a strong comic book character. That is what makes the movie good.|0
I mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb kids go to Oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana... this could've been fun, if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun. The only thing that I almost showed my teeth of, was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either Oklahoma or Kansas... The plot could have been fun, had it not been for abysmal interpretation. If you even think about watching this piece-of-crap movie, don't.|1
Why would I say that ? Because when the movie ended , I was in a good mood . So I saw the film. I said that if I could not wait , I have a great time in the theatre . And I was excited to go see the movie. I am curious about your reaction to this film? Does it have an ending or do you have to wait for the end of the film in the theater? Thanks for the response. If the movie ended, how was it going to end and when was it finally supposed to end?|0
A group of adventurers travel to the 'dark continent' to try and locate a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years before in a plane crash, and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess.Once again, my search for sleazy, European cannibal movies has taken me deep into Jess Franco territorya seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub-par scriptwriting, crawling with crap camera-work, and abundant with awful acting (Franco regular Lina Romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing, elderly woman).|1
This is by far the most vapid , idiotic , insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air. The show is an entire series, complete with almost all of the main characters, some of the most egregious, some of the least hilarious people in existence, and a total of 15 episodes each week. The only way that I could ever be bothered to watch that show, would be if you went on a vacation (or were in some other country), and saw that this show has never existed.|0
"Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in Rockport MA , which is a beautiful town where I love the scenery, there's not a ton of noise to get a closer look at. And I've seen many movies that are based on the movie and they didn't look too good, so I'm just gonna leave you with a few comments about that movie. That's not my thing, I didn't know how to say that. I mean, it's like ""wow that was awesome,"" but the movie looked good and the cast looked great."|0
This junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber . The film is an oddity, if not a bore . In the original novel, the book is said to have been written around 1280, while the novel was published around 1278. However, this was the same year in which the movie was released. The original movie had a script by a French writer and a French publisher. The French publisher had made this film in 1875 as a gift to the author . In the book, which was reissued in 1975 as the novel of the same name .|0
I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most horrors in the middle. So I received the DVD of 'Acacia' in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd, disjointed movements hiding under duvets.The major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are from and what they do.|1
"The most amazing film I have ever seen . I did n't read the programming and I just stumbled onto it and its amazing

I didn't finish reading it. Its a long way to go to learn about a film and what it's really about, and I don't have a whole lot to learn. I read all of that and it will make me think about things as a whole when I read it. It's also very cool to read the movie and not think that's what I'm doing or doing right now."|0
What a self-indulgent mess ! Duncan Roy 's film is apparently autobiographical , however it 's impossible to find any detailed info on what happened to Duncan 's parents after they arrived from the UK. I can't find a copy of this film anywhere I go to and I don't have the link on my Google search. The film will be based on this story, and is not available to view. I thought I should have mentioned that I've seen Duncan's film on Youtube earlier, but I forgot to mention that he's based in Germany now, and that's all he has in store for his film.|0
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show.I saw nothing really new here, just the same old stuff from other flicks changed around a little. The best action scenes were Nia's as she once again kicked butt. It was interesting seeing her as the bad guy after watching her for two seasons on Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking butt, but for the good guys.|1
Went with some friends and one of my friends mom , thinking it would be a good way to start with our wedding. I think we were just about to get married on the first day of the month. The wedding was about 10 days long but I wanted to go through with it so I didn’t plan to put it too early. I didn’t plan to spend any time outside of our town. I was nervous that my friends would be watching us. But I think I was very nervous and had a pretty nice day.|0
I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull. I found myself disliking the main character and the following actors/actresses that came in the scenes. The camera work was non pleasing itself. Random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and I turned the film off. I will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Becoming Jane; and Pride and Prejudice. I've only a few others to watch besides these films but I believe they were done in great taste.|1
No blood , no sex ( though it oozes passion ) , no special effects , but just one of them . The only one I don't like is the one with a red face , but I don't see it any more . The first time I've seen it in the mirror was about the first time I've seen a red-faced girl wearing a blue blouse. I don't like this one, and as I've known it for ages, I've not liked the first. It's the first red face I've seen which I hate.|0
"Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I expected some Hostel-style movie, the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed ""victim"" messing the whole set until she finally ""die"". Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us, the viewers, that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.The main character, the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina."|1
I really could n't get into this movie . The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long it's time to go look for her in an unknown location . It's all just so hard, I don't believe I could find her anywhere . . . and not just in my house . . . and if you're in that movie you have to look for the person in your house . . . or maybe the person in my house . . . and if she's there or not in it's probably not the person's home . .|0
I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to come down hard on this movie. The director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. Such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film.|1
Writer & director Jay Andrews , a.k.a . Jim Wynorski , serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a more modern take on the genre. On his own terms, this is the movie he's trying to create, one which will get you hooked as you go deeper into the movie. This is one he'll go back and forth on and the more he tries to make it sound as if it is, in some ways, as if its going to get you hooked again, I mean that sounds great.|0
This is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. It's dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.I watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn't any. The shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. These have to be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space.The only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are least cheap.|1
There was nothing remotely funny about this movie . It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing as bad as the movie. For instance, a couple of years after the movie I watched it I watched a documentary on the topic and it gave me the feeling that I have never seen a movie like this in my entire life. I had the feeling it was a good movie but I have not seen a movie like this in my entire life. And yes, it made an appearance here in the UK but that's all I know.|0
"Sappy.I liked how they went to the ""Haaavaad baaa"" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.Just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. ""Do you like apples? ""the guy nods or something. ""Well, how'd ya like DEM APPLES!"" Wow, that IS genius.Duh, Minnie Driver would give her number to anybody. Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf."|1
"OK, well, no one in their right mind(s) would pick up a movie titled ""The Man with the Screaming Brain"" and expect it to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and that means a truly hokey plot, strange characters, clichés, over-the-top action, and oh-so-cheesy one liners. For that odd segment of the population (including myself) that gets a kick out of that kind of thing, this is a gem.The acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is embedded in his character. Bruce Campbell brings a spirited, convincing performance."|1
Now for sure , this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and I think most of it is a good thing. I’m sure he’ll add one more character to that list of characters, which I don’t think he would, but we’ll let them all out of this story for the time being. For me, they’re just good, but I really want to give them a thumbs up! For me, the best part about all of this is because it is so simple and so fun.|0
Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda Moore tries to call `` humor '' . That this movie is so offensive is not even a coincidence. ... It was about a man who loves to play baseball and when he gets up and goes to play it at the stadium he has to tell his friends. I think you can say it was not meant to be funny, but that is not the case. ... I don't know that it is the case that people feel this way. When you are in the right situation, people who do that are going to make a better person.|0
This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know...but how good is it? Well, let's not be silly. It's still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it's a fine film. Again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. ****SPOILER****When a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow.|1
"The film tells you to be aware and conscientious. It also destroys any and all things, the Bible claims to be true. To people like me the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. It has been called ""blasphemy"", and it is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear, that many people think of it as a good sequel to the Bible. However, the film shows you a lot of things and subjects, that can be interpreted as a filmic version of the ""Revelation""."|1
This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.Jose Ferrer played the title role in the animated TV series The Legend of Chunsoft. You can find the trailer for this episode on our YouTube channel. We'll see if you get a chance to watch it right away, though you'll be able to catch a few episodes in the future. But that's all to say that I don't think a lot of things have changed in the past 10 years. We have a few more episodes to catch, and that will surely change the show's future.|0
My wife and I could n't even finish the film . Truly , it was rather painful.First , the historical background , the history of what has happened in Russia and in America.The movie had been a huge success so far. On top of it , I have to say that I have watched the film a lot and I love the way the story has been told. However, I'm not quite convinced that it was worth the hype, because I've read that the film was very similar to what you may see in the movie.|0
"""The Quickie"" tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and...well, frankly, this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary.Jason Leigh introduces herself to Mr. Mob-guy as being from ""Pacific Exterminators"" with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say ""West Coast Exterminators"". Eventually the mob-guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (duh).In another scene Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette giving a hooker $4000 to bet whether he'll live or die. She has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets ""live""."|1
"...I can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... This is such a slow POS going absolutely nowhere. Oh yeah OK it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of OK. Editing: BAD! I suppose the editor was told ""we need at least 90 minutes"", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. Music: don't get me started on that, the lousiest score I've ever heard."|1
( Contains spoilers ) People who put a Lonely Heart 's ad in the newspaper are often idealists . They want you to go home for the weekend and spend a bit of a weekend with them, which makes them even more attractive. It's the way you express yourself to people, it makes them feel less intimidated and less vulnerable. At one of the meetings, for instance, you may have been invited to speak on how you were feeling, as you did a couple of other meetings that you did in person, and so forth, to people.|0

From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying something. The horror movies had a lot going on and it is so much worse than the real world world. The biggest problem is the war movies are so much in the way they are very slow, and they are very dangerous, so they are very easy and they can cause a lot of harm to human beings. And it is all the more frightening because there are a lot of movies on the internet about war, but the movie is not that bad.|0
"The most vivid portrait of small-town oddity I've seen in a long time -and I'm not just talking about Australian films. This piece of work seems to have been made ""under the radar"" and really, it's an entirely fascinating piece of work, that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent Aust. film making.At times it is rather slow and strange - it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head-movie'. But the stunning aspect of the film by Alex Frayne is its iron fisted, ruthless direction."|1
Fortunately, I haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. I doubt that I would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.Disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue.|1
"First the premise stinks ... little boy likes to dress in girls clothes . It reminded me of Norman Bates's ""The Little Man"" from the '60s. . . . In this case, that scene is a little boy's fantasy. If you've got it right you'll be able to get a girl in his costume and go out with her. But that's not where we come in, is it? There are a few more things going on here with the character of the Little Boy that make it look like there's something to do with him."|0
I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. And that is not saying a little, because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. But this is beyond bad. This movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad.Reviewing this is almost impossible. There are no strong points and nothing positive to say. I'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked. First off, the CGI has to be one of the worst i've seen.|1
I can see that the ratings for this film are n't all that high for this film , so I will give you the rating of what I'm seeing. The film is the second best film in the world at this point and the only one that makes you think that this is a good film. But you have to understand that it is still not a good movie for you. For the most part, the rating is good but the only reason to believe it is a good is because the film is just so much better than it already is.|0
I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films . I found the film at first boring but after a little research and testing it out I decided it could be just the thing that I wanted to see so this is how it starts to look in real life . I did this in the early 1980's and in a couple of the later ones this was my first film that I did a bit of editing on. It's hard to tell if it was because there were too many references to it or if it was because of the way that it was filmed.|0
"I thought this series was going to be another fun , action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. I have been looking into this series and this article which I have read was really helpful. This is the first and only page I had to read for me. Thanks

This is the third and last page in the series. I just finished this series and am going to read more later. I am trying to learn a little more in the meantime. I am still looking into this series and I think I can find a way to get this thing going!"|0
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He's definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity.|1
I watched this movie the other night , and I have to admit , it was quite possibly the best movie to see on a Thursday evening. The music was not so bad. But the dialogue was just the best (with a few exceptions), and there was nothing I could really relate to that I could do. It is a good movie, and I do hope that someone with a better idea will give it a go. I am sure there will be a few who disagree, but this is a big one, and I do hope that some people enjoy it.|0
Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films , Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray , Jeremy Brock brings to life a tale about the world-renowned poet and author, a world renowned literary scholar, a gifted writer, a musician and a human being. The film will be seen in theaters and online as a feature. On April 2, 2016 at 9 p.m., The Hollywood Reporter announced the release of Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray . The film will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this fall on the first Sunday of every month on March 2 at the Hollywood Theater in Los Angeles.|0
I must first mention that as a group of mates , we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are not so much fun (i.e. we don't have the time to enjoy them). We have also had to have an active role-model, in the same way as we do our role-models of life and the future. I have had the same experience when watching a movie with two of my girlfriends. They were having fun watching the same scene together and it was great. Now that the two of them were married, they were able to spend as many as they liked on the same scene.|0
"When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. You're in for dark, harrowing films like ""Alice"" and ""Little Otik,"" or short gems such as ""Down to the Cellar"" and ""Jabberwocky."" All of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.On the other hand, when Svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights."|1
"My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie. I felt that I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me. The movie ""Babas bilar"" must be just about the worst film I ever seen. I really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something happened. What makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper."|1
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It's not like American Pie or something. I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it's part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy), GREAT acting, and a cheesy ending. (minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along.|1
Made with film stock left over from the production of Nana, 1927's Sur un Air de Charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and that's the best way to view it. Jean Renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together. The plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris where a white native girl teaches him the Charleston (naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'White Aborigine' music).|1
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.Even little things like Flynn licking one stamp after another, when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. Flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder. He is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody, and he did not end up on skid row in Sydney. He did not get his twopenny-halfpenny role in In the Wake of the Bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star.|1
Bronson took the money and ran with this film ; he must have house payments like me ! This low point in my film is not a good film. I'm sure that this is why I'm saying it's a bad idea to film this, even if I have no idea how to make this film. I've been to several theaters and I've seen this film. If I see the film and think I'm going to film it I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make the film. But I'm not sure where to start.|0
Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I don't like the baby and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage. Even at only 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a rehash of the first movie. Actually that is just an insult to rehashes. Why was this sequel made??|1
How sad it is when a film as wonderful as `` Jurassic Park '' slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre as a movie -- but as a movie, one can't help but wonder how much of this movie had a place in the public eye. I can see it as well as you do in the movie, but there is still something to consider. The movie itself is made with a director, producer, and cinematographer, so it's a bit odd that they are so much more talented than I expected, but a lot more fun as a movie than a movie.|0
Though often considered Peter Sellers' worst film, it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a departure from the type of film Sellers was best known for; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (of Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies), but was marked by its ribaldary, irreverence, and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day. It was ahead of its time (1972) in taking the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take into the cinema some time later.|1
A big disappointment for what was touted as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute. We don't really learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage turns in an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script let him down. And how, after not being able to perform for the whole film, can he have an erection on his deathbed?|1
After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan , a metal object in it 's brain . In the museum, there are three types of people (cat, horse, goat) and several types of objects are there . A cat is the one with the eyes that see the cat's body . A horse and a goat is the one with the feet that see the horse's head . All the cats that can see are the ones that can see the head of a horse . If you look closely at this image , it shows a few of the things you can see.|0
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a seduction story line, two strip tease acts, and war/shooting/blood into a G rating? Weird. I would rate it PG-13.Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The storyline was a little weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue.|1
When I stepped into the theater, I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.This movie is basically about a young girl (P.S.|1
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie.|1
This movie was a sicky sweet cutesy romantic comedy , just the kind of movie I usually dislike but this one isn't. It was supposed to be a hit of the day but on the way in to the cinema I forgot about it, I was too tired to watch it right away but as it was coming I had to do some research on the subject. It didn't make sense to me though, it's kind of boring to me. I like to think so, but I am still getting tired of watching this movie but this one is really great and I have no idea why.|0
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . Definitely not a well made movie . The problem is that it didn’t fit in as well as I thought it was supposed to . This movie is a very fun movie to watch . I would like to see this movie play out more smoothly in the future. I don’t think we could say “we could have done a worse job with this movie” but that’s not the situation . I will say that it was a very entertaining movie , but it wasn’t the best movie we saw in the whole time .|0
"Recently I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie, which took me three sessions over three days to get through. That's another comment in the making.But what I wanted to comment on first was the carelessness on the special features of the DVD. It included a game of memory, which asks the player/viewer to match up pairs of animals in order for them to board the ark. However, every time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen prompts the player to find (or congratulates the player on finding)""it's mate."""|1
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD . Lost is the exciting and thrilling story of a man who finally found his true calling. It is his time to take charge and start his own career that he is proud to tell. The truth about what he feels about the city is one of the things he does best to help others. When we first met in January we all knew it was almost a day. We thought it might be a good time for a change and that he would be there for a change and that we would make it better.|0
"There were nice characters in here, played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses, plus it had a famous band and some famous dancers.....yet the film just didn't work. By the time this was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialog was dumb, the humor (mainly Milton Berle's) was downright stupid and the music was just not up my alley.I've never been a big-band fan, anyway, and if I hear ""In The Mood"" one more time I'll puke.This was my first look at famous skater-actor Sonja Henie and I have no complaints about her."|1
"ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's ""Izzy"" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true."|1
Some sort of accolades must be given to `Hellraiser: Bloodline'. It's actually out Full-Mooned Full Moon. It bears all the marks of, say, your `Demonic Toys' or `Puppet Master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? Full Moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. These Hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. This increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as I am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish.|1
"Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse then Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yeah, it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed scripted Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in one other film and it was only on T.V. =oPThis movie is ""D"" quality. I had a chance to watch it on the SciFi channel back in 1997."|1
This film works on a lot of different levels. It's a profile of one very cool couple, a social commentary on aging and nursing homes, a love story, a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times, and every time I watch it I'm not sure who to go call first--my parents, my wife, a friend I've lost touch with . . But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue.|1
Have to agree that this movie and it 's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve . Here is a picture of that movie . The picture was done in 1997. This movie has been produced in the USA, Europe and the UK . . . The movie is set in a medieval city , but the cast is based on the real people living here . There are hundreds of different costumes and costumes , but I do not know of any particular costume which is the best to suit all of us . . . What you may call a 'sick' movie is a movie that's ' sick'.|0
This was it! i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff.The one thing that i hated was that why was Shannon kicked off and not Alyssa. i hate her i would rather her character die that Shannon's. what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and Prue was crying by her side i started crying too lol. at the time that this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore!|1
I 'm not a big musical fan , but this is one of the few I really love . Unlike other artists I've made my way on-stage . It's just as good as being with the other singers , it's also a great song for me . You have to work hard to enjoy it and I've only got 3 songs for it . It's really good . When I first heard the song , I didn't understand what it was . The lyrics are very different but when I looked at it , it really made sense . It's really good .|0
I could not believe what i saw ... ( once ) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should have left the theater, or had the courage to continue their journey to the end of their days. It's all been made possible through the help of the brave actors, from a new actress, who is a member of the group, to the brave actors, who have helped with the film. Today, I want to talk to some more brave actor who will help make this happen. The first thing I need to do, is to ask him to write me some words for this video.|0
I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews . The script is not even 100% flawless so far. It looks like we are dealing with a bug, but the testsuite is a bit strange. I have tested it before and it is completely flawless, so it is not even remotely possible. The tests have been done on the latest versions of Chrome (2.8.10, 2.5.2, 2.3) and I can't even test how well this worked with Firefox (1.7.13, 1.7.14, 1.8.13 and 1.8.12).|0
`` Escape from Hell '' is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is : crass exploitation . '' I think I can still say that it wasn’t the last time I used it to make a joke. So if you don’t like it and you think it isn’t cool, then it is not funny. In this article, I have tried to clarify things. If I say there is nothing to laugh about, it isn’t really funny because the jokes are all true.|0
well, i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday pressie for my Dad. The film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages.... much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion (and i used to work in the Disney Store!!!). The characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly.|1
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was actually a really fun festival, and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot. A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together. It's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. Story stems from real life occurrences, ripped straight from the headlines. Raw, blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end. The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity.|1
Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott(Marshall Thompson)has developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far man can go up in the atmosphere. His brother, Lt. Dan Prescott(Bill Edwards), seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up in the Y12. Dan of course has a problem with taking orders and is also an over confident dare devil. On Dan's second flight, he hits over the 300 miles up comfort zone and his craft passes through a meteor dust storm.|1
"Jack Higgins' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden IRA bomber forced into ""one last job"" (where have I heard that plot before?) gets a snarky treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses all to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who accidentally witnessed the shooting. The rules of the church keep Father Bob from talking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They bond at the church organ. What? Really, that's the plot."|1
CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In reality, taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured.|1
"Personally, I don't like a lot of b/w movies, but there's something magical about this movie. The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). ""Liz"" writes a magazine column about how she's the 'Martha Stewart' of Connecticut. Of course, she's lying. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr Yardley, asks her to play host to a NAVY sailor over Christmas. In addition, Mr Yardley, who's going to be alone for Christmas, invites himself up to the farm for the Christmas party."|1
When I bought 4 DVDs for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of David Selznick Productions. With a cast containing such names as James Stewart and Carole Lombard I was looking forward to a real treat. As many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. HOWEVER, I am so glad that I did view this film as I now have the memorable saying 'Never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by.|1
"Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in ""Beware, My Lovely,"" a 1952 film from RKO. Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team, both being consummate professionals and strong performers. In this film, based on a Broadway play called ""The Man,"" Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home. She's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years, she's not ready to move on."|1
Watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav...(realized then I should have gone for Lakshya). A typical plot...India v Pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have Kashmir in the middle. An Indian super hero goes on a mission to save the President of India from some Pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. I left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place.|1
Steven Seagal is back! Here with his third film released this year. Of course as a one time fan who has become increasingly disgruntled I can say it comes as no surprise that this is pretty lame. Firstly the film made headlines because of apparent problems in production due to Seagal. He would turn up late on set, change the script, crew etc and generally cause problems for the director, Don E Faun Leroy (his lack of talent his trouble enough!). This also happens in their second collaboration the upcoming Mercenary which promises to be just as bad as this garbage.|1
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school . I thought they were great. It got me thinking about how we've become, as far as the human mind is concerned, a social animal. That's why we have our social instincts. And, for a lot of people, I don't think people would have the same reason. For some people I mean, I don't think. In any case. And yet I do think it's pretty good. I think there are some people I think are pretty bad at the end of a movie.|0
Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde ' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it 's intended,' it's not surprising that you might want to try it. In reality, she's just another girl who's simply trying to get along with other girls for fun. With a little help from a guy in the gym, she'll find her own way to the next level - with a bit of encouragement from a friend - with a girl who just wants to be treated like an object of affection and pleasure.|0
"Since the past couple of days I'm really hooked on the ""Female Scorpion"" series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now  which is way too long  before purchasing the whole box set. ""Beast Stable"" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment. Never before, or after, has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines, settings, themes and filming styles."|1
This movie was pointless . I ca n't even call it sci-fi , since that requires more from a movie maker , so they shouldnt even try it . They wouldnt even make a movie in which the movie starts with two characters, and it ends with two characters, and wouldnt make a movie about how to write the script. the only thing that would work for me is to write a movie about that . But i cant help that. i think i will do the best possible job . It only works for movies , not movies .|0
Or vice-versa.This is a French film noir directed by an American film maker (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country because of being blacklisted by Hollywood thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is rather familiar--one last jewel heist for Tony le Stephanois and his buds--and so is the ending with everybody getting... Well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the sort of film in which tension toward the ending is important.Dassin filmed in realistic lighting in black and white on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous.|1
"So, this is the WORST movie you will probably ever see. It's up there with ""Crossbones"" and ""Southern Comfort"", but if your a bad movie fan like I am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years. WHY does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? WHY does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? And who is he anyway? WHY do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? What is this? Highlander? Dracula McCloud? Who cares!"|1
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot.|1
This movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book . As written by Rafael Sabatini , this is a masterpiece. And although you won't like it, you'll enjoy it too. In his recent review , Sabatini explains why his movie doesn't deserve any credit . He is a man who believes the universe should be as good or as bad as we can imagine. He says that there are many reasons to love a movie as a whole but he also describes some of his favorite scenes from the movie in some detail. What are some of these scenes that he likes better?|0
I love this show . It 's clever and very well acted . David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry . I 'm thinking that it has been years since I was a TV person . It 's really good , but it has not been the way I've been treated in my entire career . I need to be seen more often . . . . . . . I 'm really thinking that it looks like this is the first show I ever did. And that it 's going to show that when it 's all over again . . .|0
As someone has already mentioned on this board , it 's very difficult to make a fake documentary . It must be very expensive and time-consuming . So it is very likely that I will make one , but that is only the second one . Now, for the first one , it's quite difficult to make an important documentary . But it's very possible . But I will do the second one as a way of making it a better one . I can't make it for more than 5-6 years , and still do this .|0
"Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero. He's got LOSER written all over him, but that doesn't stop him from ""getting the girl."" Probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable, he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car. Well, his new job is racing still, as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes. There's nothing really to endear you to Rod, even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid."|1
This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score, poor acting, and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B movie this is down right awful. After reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it. But all the bad reviews were so right. I totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. I'm a huge Sci-fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow.|1
This is a classic continuation to Bleu , the likewise excellent film , with Juliet Binouche as a main star. He plays a very good old friend in the company of two other men. However, for those of us in our own age, that is quite different from the fact being stated above. Like I said in the beginning, a lot of this stuff is completely wrong and I would love to learn something about it but I think this is something I have to learn a lot in my life, especially in regards to the story.|0
"Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange there was of course ""no question about it"" that I had to see this one. However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like ""extremely boring"" or ""nothing happened"" ""a complete waste of time"". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001: A Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening."|1
I am 17, and a biased Muppet fan, and while I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper, The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It is enormously entertaining, thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl, and the film looks lovely, with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs, I really liked them, sure they aren't the best song score out of the Muppet franchise, but they were very nice to listen to, especially Never Before.|1
With its ww2 timing, falling in and out of love, and easy on the eye Kira, this is re-Atonement. This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. Vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace.|1
"I ca n't explain it , but I find this movie not only funny , but so enjoyable I feel. I am trying to make a video and I am having trouble making sense of it , but I was hoping that someone who has seen my review would tell me so. Here it is :

I hope you find this movie interesting and fun , even if it just looks good . If you ever have one, I'm happy to help. Thank you very much! I love the way they did this movie, it is funny and entertaining as well."|0

Has this ever happened to you ? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals and see who's looking at me. The only thing I can't get my hands on is the box. And I have never been to the store, nor seen it. But I can't take it any further. What should I do ? Just go back in and say hi to everyone. I can't see anyone in my area, which is a small area of the town that I don't have on my phone, but maybe on the TV or maybe on my cell.|0
I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites...it has all the charm, 1940's quaintness, and good old fashioned romance and it's hilarious, to boot! Barbara Stanwick plays an independent single woman who writes cooking\home life articles for a famous magazine...under the premise that she is a married homemaker. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter a handsome GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan)just rescued off of a raft along with his buddy.|1
"This representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. I know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot. ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch.We see little long-haired Jack trade a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard (I guess poor Jack attained the wrong kind)."|1
I rented this movie expecting it to suck , and it did n't let me down . I rented it expecting to suck , and I don't know , because this movie sucks . I can see why someone would want to get that movie and why he would want to get the whole movie , but he just can't because he doesn't like it . I thought that was the main thing to see , that the movie could suck and I can see why he would want to do that . My movie is coming out right today and I can't wait .|0
Forget any angst-ridden documentary ! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose love of the porn industry has only gotten worse. He doesn’t know how to love it, however. With the help of friends and family he does just that, as it turns out, for the very reason I’ve been calling it a film. There are only two things in life worth watching this kind of porn: first, the movies you watch; and, second, the porn they’ve been produced. This isn’t even funny.|0
"Spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus aren't there. A very lousy way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen."|1
"I did n't understand the people who rated it over 5 . I think it 's a horrible film from which to see what they think of it, even if it's poorly done. You are not alone. I would say that the reviews of the other films were mixed. There are many who say, ""I don't see the film, or at least not as much as I'd like, and I'm not as excited to see it as I am. But that is because it's done in the best way that it can be done...""."|0
The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the middle of the mountain. They find the remains of an abandoned ship, but no crew, and the miner gets a message. The crew goes back to their home and asks the crew for a new ship. The ship gets the ship and the ship gets a message from it, but then the ship goes off. At some point, the miner goes down and finds a missing crew member. He goes back down and the crew is told the ship is gone, but they don't know where.|0
Wow , this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends . If you have had a crap day, you have made a mistake. I don't believe in it, but you are in the right place, but I don't want to repeat myself. LOL, did you think I was being sarcastic in the middle? I think I have a right to be so. Thanks for reading, you've done an awesome job on this thread. You've put this thread right back where it's been for a couple of years now.|0
I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left bitterly disappointed with the third instalment. it destroys the fine work of the first two films with weak and cheesy action and a story line that turns the apocalyptic Australian wastelands into a comical sand pit one would expect to see in a children's adventure movie. the character of max is unrecognisable from his dark and cynical persona seen in the previous films and changed into a predictable uninteresting saviour that left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this film yet then simply don't.|1
Wow... I suspected this one to be bad... But now I find myself just at a loss for words... Honestly, no words of mine can do this movie any justice...I'll try to say something anyway...This truly is one unique gem. One of the worst kind.Lash La Rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a Toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie's climax...??? A true stroke of genius, without a doubt.It rarely happens that I laugh out loud when watching a movie alone.|1
A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I'd already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this. Honestly - just don't bother. A total and absolute waste of time. Bad acting. Bad story. Predictable. Simple. Pathetic. After a while I was only watching to see what happens, since I'd already invested my time into it. Totally surprised Mrs Forlani played in a weak movie as this.|1
This film was great!Tangi Miller and Flex did a great job. They both look good together and they both pulled it off.Tasha Smith was so funny as the cousin,and she couldn't stay out of her business.Essence held it down for her girl, when she needed her. Aloma was sweet and played a dear Grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother.And Oh,I can't forget about the stripper, he was so find, and I didn't know if I should cover my eyes or smile while I watch him reveal his sexiness on the big screen.Damn!|1

"Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie , and really squandered it . Do n't be led to wonder why , and so i hope you will , but it is . Thursday, May 21, 2011

I wanted to try it out today but I can't do it. Not only have I tried, but also I have spent so much money trying to find the perfect place to do it for the price I could never find it in my budget. I know you can find a lot to spend for movies in this genre , but there was nothing that made me really feel it."|0
It does not surprise me that this short ( 91 minutes ) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago is going to be on the big screen as much as it has been ever since that time: “The Movie,” starring Tom Hanks. It is a great piece of art, but you can’t go past it without giving it a proper dose of thought. So what’s on it for you guys? 1. It’s not over yet, but I like to think of it like this. 2. The film is not over yet, but I like that.|0
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law. It is the only thread in the world that really makes the story stand out. You know what would make me fall short if I said there is a movie in the world worth seeing? One of the main reasons why I do not watch the movie is because I would not be able to get into the theater for the movie. There are two theaters in the United States, but if I saw something in the theater it would fall into the wrong one.|0
"By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive ""music"" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big ""surprises"" (which actually tend to be about as ""revelatory"" as The National Enquirer's headlines). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. This movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience."|1
i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up . ( got a good laugh ) but since it is an episode about a man trying to save his nephew from being killed by another man, this is not an episode where I feel like this is funny. This is a pretty good episode, really, though I really want to see an episode like this again. I hope I don't offend anyone by saying that it's a comedy, because I would never do such a thing if I weren't getting it right.|0
Great subject matter, director, and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made. (And hello, this is NOT a film-noir!) The lackluster, overly complicated, over-populated story has no arc, no focus point, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose, other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly doubtful cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration.|1
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. This was made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.This movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. There is no mystery or suspense. The people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.The five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts.|1
"This movie really starts strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot sent to Australia to fix Coke's marketing problems. We also know he is an eccentric genius. Roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.Unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.Usually, I am a sucker for bold and far out plots. Examples which I am fond of include, ""Dark Star,"" ""O.C. & Stiggs,"" and ""Popeye."""|1
When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild , get ready . You 're in for dark , harrowing films. You're back on time . But you know what, I have some bad news for you . In the first of what I hope will be some great movies I'll give you all the answers I know so far . I know you're not all the same , but as you've just heard, you're still not a hero . You're still a little afraid of the world . But you are not afraid to go to the brink .|0
There were only two redeeming features about this movie; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form. Forget about the plot or storyline from the book - they're completely absent from this movie. In fact, about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players. Even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations. If the film makers had made a good movie, even though unrelated to the book, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Unfortunately, they did not.|1
During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films , only one was released by a British film distributor in 1980 and in 1982, it was released by a British studio and by an Australian cinema distributor after the end of that period. At that point in time, the two British distributors had been together for a couple of years but it was after this that the film was re-released by a British film distributor at the time. As they both saw the light of the 1980s they decided that it should be a classic.|0
This is only the fourth effort I ’ ve watched from this director ( whom I met and found quite interesting), I think it is worth watching for a few minutes to appreciate what you see. I think it is a good way to show that when a director finds the right director, there will be a huge amount of work done in the field and hopefully some of it will be better than the next one. In addition, since I haven’t watched a lot of more successful directors in my 30 years of working in film, you could also get some good advice from some of your peers.|0
As embarrassing as it is to admit , I was listed as production manager on this film ... my very first role. This was not a good decision and I didn't know about it when I arrived, but I got to see the movie. I don't think I knew that I needed to audition for this because I knew that this was a movie I would most probably never get to see at this stage. But now, this is my first audition and I am very, very good at it and I have a very interesting idea.|0
As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, I must say that the 1980's version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this. It was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. This new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet does not have as much depth, either. Although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with. Nice costumes, though.|1
I watched this movie again yesterday with a 20-year-old intern from my office (OK - it was the quiet day after Thanksgiving) and we both loved it. I love the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door. Isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies?I also love the old folks at the restaurant - they remind me of some of the older people around Southern New England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion.|1

I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan . I figured it could n't be that bad if it wasn't. It's really good. I don't know how I could have written the screenplay if it wasn't written. Maybe they didn't make a good movie. But I love this movie, so much. If it's not as bad as you think, I am going to think about it a bit. So this is my review for the book. And you can see a pretty good look at the characters and the stories that they portray.|0
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional. Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it.I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film. I couldn't image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role, but his performance truly exemplified his character. This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support, unlike so many other movies. It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie, but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see it.This films is Truly Exceptional!|1
"SPOILERS A Jewish Frodo ? Yep , that 'll be Elijah Wood again.Ever since the concluding part of `` Lord of the Rings''. I remember the beginning of that film, and I could tell what I'd been reading. When I read some of that movie, the story is a lot more complicated than the rest of it:

It was a lot longer than I ever imagined. It was a lot longer than I was ever thinking about. There were a lot of parts. They were a lot longer than I ever knew. And it was a lot longer."|0
"The prey has an interesting history , unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in June of 1984

We are still in the early stages of the “we’re gonna lose it all” theory, but I’m sure I’ve been through it some more times over the last three weeks. I’m convinced that the world will fall apart once the data gets out to a level that will not allow for it to happen. It’s very important to me that all data is collected in such a way that is “fair” and consistent."|0
"Have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and wonder-How did they screw it up so bad? This is one of those. The book by Huffaker, ""Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian"" was great, riotously funny...this movie is not. It seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we CARED about the characters. This movie, which touches on some real concerns about Indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust, or slavery. Not well done."|1
I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form.|1
"This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films, most spectacularly in ""Alien"" - and some decent ""he-man"" performances from the male cast. The possessed astronaut's wife, to me, is the weak link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes, for which I blame director Corman. Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play, ""Blood Beast"" might have been pretty decent."|1
If you're coming to this film to learn something about depression, forget it: you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject. I understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood feature... no small feat. Christina Ricci as Elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her lungs, viciously insulting someone, bursting into tears or some combination of the three (the only exceptions being some quiet sulking at the beginning and end).|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished artist. He is often described as an ‘astute composer’ and in fact even a composer himself. C. Thomas Howell, who died on October 3, 2017, was born on July 5, 1877, and is believed to be the second of three children, and the last of three brothers who were born after him. We’ll never forget C. Thomas Howell, and I believe we’re going to have to hear about him.|0
I generally loved the Carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful. There are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced.There is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just tacky. Joan Sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey its just plain sad. When you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch.|1
"First off, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said ""well, mistakes happen"" and brushed it off. After about the 10th time, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the film yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.Now, about the film."|1
Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. The result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway staging.There is, however, a flaw.|1
Young writers, young auteur, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even lame is too good a description, that suggests that three of four legs were functioning, when actually, none of them were. Barely enough recycled plotline for a 48 and a half minute television hour, gratingly stretched to ninety minutes. The audience was talking back to the screen, so bad was the story. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has this been done on television? Bad cops frame good cops.|1
The sun was not shining , it was too wet to play , so I went to the movies , watched a trailer , and found that it was in it for the first movie of the night. I loved watching it, so enjoyed it a lot. It was a good way to spend an evening and then after that I spent another evening looking at the movie before bed. This was a nice way to spend my own evening with my family . I would love to have a second movie on my calendar that I could have watched in the morning before I was ready to make the movie.|0
Death Camp Opera: Right Here, Right Now!Ten years ago, I read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His picture was acted by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me and others. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually.Over the years, I realized how hard it was to find it. Maybe I would, by coincidence? Anyway, it's yet an old story. I saw it a short while ago.|1
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen , and who will die . It is very important to note, that this is not a single scene , but multiple scenes , many of which will unfold on the same page. The main event of this movie was a shot of our hero, who is standing in his own backyard , shooting his gun . In other words, it is a single shot . A couple of the shots, as well as some of the scenes with our hero, are shown below .|0
One look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills , in an attempt to put together the ratings they thought were important. I have not been able to find a movie with a 3.4.1 that actually had that one, though. The rating in this video is 4.0 out of 5 stars. The rating of 5.1.1 by Shill is a close enough score so that I could be certain it was rated 3.7, but it would have been 5.5 if the rating were 3.7. The average rating of 6.3 was 2.4. Here is where I came in.|0
If any movie ever made Italians look bad , this is it.Duke Mitchell - what an A -- HOLE .Duke Mitchell was a great guy. When he didn't get to the gym, his abs were a little weak. But then he went back to the gym, and there was another gym to go with it. This film is great. I was so impressed, but when I watched it on my screen it felt like something was wrong. And it made me so uncomfortable to go back on the couch and watch it on the screen!|0
"to make this short and sweet: i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the ""gener-asian"" of american film making. the acting was sub-par, relying on stereotypes, raised voices, and exaggerated eye-buggery to convey its message. chris chan park does not delve very deep into the any of his characters, allowing them to remain caricatures of angry/frustrated/distant/uncommunicative asians. these depictions do not make characters mysteriously appealing; it makes them confusing and unsympathetic. i like to think that us asians are more complex than that.i came out of the movie unconvinced."|1
Steven Seagal is back ! Here with his third film released this year . Of course as a one time resident, I will be writing a blog about this film , it is a very fun one to write on, I have very fond memories and fond memory of many others that I have worked with before and many of the most important ones that have come to my attention . I hope to return again soon , thanks for your patience ! As I said before, I was very lucky to find you on the internet.|0
I watched 40 minutes and could n't bear it any longer  the television went off and I returned to bed and started to cry. It had been so long since I watched TV, I didn't know if I liked it, I didn't know if I would like the movie, I didn't know if I was ever going to like it. My mother and I were having such an amazing time at the bedside. I could hardly wait to have some more time. I have no idea why I'm crying and crying at all these hours.|0
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this ? I cappist, for instance. I think there are so many movies that people get the impression there are a lot more of the stuff in these movies. I mean, I know it's not as simple as that. It's so much more of the same. Maybe it's just that there are so many movies in these genres. Maybe it's a bit more than that, but still. It's a bit more complex. I think some of it might be a bit of a technical problem.|0
Story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on Halloween night . In all my life I have been the one who said to my sister, “We have to go out and kill these monsters and scare them out of existence.” But I was never actually that scared. My mom said to me “It’s so bad. You can go out and eat all the monsters, but if you want to get yourself killed in the process then you gotta do it. You gotta take out all of those other things.|0
I 've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake for me. She’s a brilliant woman and I loved her a lot more then she’s doing. As I said above, the film’s story is pretty funny, but it’s really funny because I’m trying to see if there are other people out there in the world who will be affected by the same events. This was a lot of fun in my mind (and, of course, I’m a bit disappointed that I never got that chance).|0
This movie was lacking in a lot of areas . It 's about this Elvis type guy who races cars for the United States Navy, but it's not a big deal, though, because he lives on the bottom floor of an apartment complex, and I would think he would be fine. I have no idea what that is, but it's funny, and it may just be the best movie I've seen before in a long, long time, because it had a very good cast, a very funny movie, and a great storyline.|0
This movie was chosen, quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local Video store. It turned out to be quite a pig. The plot line-such as it is-was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable. The actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines. The only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertant deployment of an airbag. The remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters (aged less than ten years), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even the cat or the dog.|1
"A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with her mother-in-law, but she's not his daughter."" ""You'll never believe how the story ends."" ""Not if I can help it."" ""The story ends with the girl's mother, and it ends with the boy's death, which will never end."" ""No one is ever the same again!"" ""What happens after the death of a boy?"" ""That's not a mystery."""|0
To date this is still the worst piece of rubbish I've ever viewed. So annoyed I even complained to Blockbuster for stocking it. Me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film. The plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding. The film ended quite abruptly, I'm guessing they ran out of film. Sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick Spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway. The guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder.|1
How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me . The test that postal workers are going to run into the world every day in their daily lives is the test that a post office worker has to do. No, I’m not talking about the tests that have to be carried out in the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, Italy etc. This is simply a test, not a service, so it should be more about the way that a Post office worker does things.|0
Seriously, Sci-Fi needs to stop making movies. They're all horrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it, and he couldn't help the movie. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary goat eater of Mexico, the chupacabra, and brings it aboard a cruise ship captained by Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, guns ablazin'. But they can't stop it. So they call in the navy. They can't stop it either.|1
"""Hollywood Cavalcade"" is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th Century Fox roster, Don Ameche and Alice Faye, and containing a couple of in jokes.The film concerns a Max Sennett type, Michael Connors (Ameche) who brings an actress to Hollywood, Molly Adair (Faye) and makes her a big silent comedienne, eventually moving her into more dramatic roles. He becomes extremely successful with her as his star. Obsessed with his work, he's absolutely shocked when she and her leading man (Alan Curtis) run off and get married."|1
Ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage to Carole Lombard. After falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. The movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. Do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? Many scenes feature a shrieking baby. The movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow a pair.|1
When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his sweetheart, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late?While not one of the great animated features (a very new art at the time this film was created) HOPPITY is an enjoyable film which should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. Technically it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality.|1
Thank god for this movie . It 's a document of talent that , three decades later , seems even less important . It has nothing to do with movies , except to make money . It does not come from Hollywood . . . The director, director and actor who made this film is none other than Bill de la Rue. And in the past few years, the director has been the most important figure in American cinema. He has a huge following in Hollywood . . . And in some of America's biggest films there are still films and television shows.|0
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to overloading. I saw it recently at an art show at the Art Theatre in San Francisco. There I witnessed a scene of a streetlifter being arrested and tortured for murder. I couldn’t quite make out what he was saying. He wasn’t a murderer. If there was such a thing, then why the hell am I doing this? That is one of the most important questions that people are having right now. What should I do or say to make it more exciting?|0
i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels ; from production to plot and character development.this definitely makes it easier to pick the right way to do the show.it was also nice that he was able to add a lot of detail as the story went forward , but was able to work in a lot of scenes that felt rushed to a certain point. and this is the only scene that I've seen that I could think of where one would think that this was going to work in this story. I'm not sure if it'll ever happen.|0
No spoiler needed to steer you clear of this ... well , bizarre film . Canada becomes part of the United States during the coronavirus outbreak , the first country to have the coronavirus outbreak declared a national emergency, followed by the U. S. during the crisis, and all the way back to Russia . We'll see what happens if the coronavirus spreads across the country and how it becomes the first country to take the virus out of the United States, and we'll find out more about Canada. This is a wonderful and hilarious book, and I'm loving every page.|0
I hope the writer, director, editor, and composer (and let's not forget producer) read this... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. Let me start by saying that I am in no way affiliated with this movie. I am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times.Every second of this movie is touching. Every scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters as people, not actors.This tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives.|1
"This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. A woman ""The EX"" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don't think ever went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband."|1
I remember watching Police Squad ! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a really interesting episode because the characters of the show didn't just get thrown around a bit and were shown in different situations. They didn't even have to interact with the police on the show. They had to play the roles of a cop, a cop-killer, or an inmate. All of the cops could do the same thing but they didn't play the role of characters in the show. When the police entered the hospital for a medical check up, they were put there to take care of them.|0
Overall, a well done movie. There were the parts that made me wince, and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at, but I came away with something more than I gone in with.I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it, let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana, is way beyond what this movie stands for. The Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India. The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family.|1
The film was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on . It 's a dog film and it was just perfect . I mean, you know, it would have looked better to the viewer if it didn't make the film. I didn't have a real problem with this film because there is nothing wrong with it . So, that's where we come in. I think if there was a big problem, that would make a film about a dog . I mean, I mean, I never thought about that, but there was a big problem there.|0
I was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the MTV-style of the show is one thing - it's also the first MTV show I saw where you go into an apartment to be greeted and treated like a celebrity or whatever. I can't say I've actually seen the show before. There were a couple of women there, but I'm pretty sure they were women with a lot of charm. It's still pretty surprising to see what they did for a show like MTV.|0
My expectations were high after seeing the trailer . They were even higher when i saw the movie had the original trailer. We had a lot of fun seeing the trailer . It had so much potential for me to get through the day. That was so cool. It was also so fun to get in and out the way of the other characters so that I could do it in my house without them being around. And when they were gone I’d like to try the movie again. But they’re still there, but not as much as I’ve wanted.|0
`` Rififi '' is a terrific heist movie , and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since the 1980s ... If you watch the first part of this book you can see why it won't get any better than the book that the first part of the book made it into . If it gets better the second part of this book is the one we've been talking about for awhile now. That's one thing that makes it so great. The other thing I think is that you can read about more about Rififi in many books.|0
Ostensibly, Hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, a nagging wife, and a lover's rejection. And despite the complex portrayal--Hans himself doesn't precisely make these claims--the above must be a substantial part of Fassbinder's thinking as well (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer may look no further than Hans' gender and sexism to locate the truer cause of his crushed spirit.First, it's highly unlikely that his mother's lack of love pushed him into signing up with the Foreign Legion.|1
From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES ( 1983 ) , comes its even more preposterous (1984) (1984). So far, we have learned nothing more about hermitism or any other religious tradition, but hermitism will remain one of the main issues to be considered when discussing hermitism (1986). The question is, What does this have to do with any of these hermitism? There is something very strange going on with the way we view religion in the world today. We often wonder what is happening, what is the meaning of our world?|0
This is a fantastic film. The acting is some of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting. The The cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Watching it, I could see parallels of cinematography used today. This is truly a groundbreaking film. Because of the cinematography and acting, the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes. It's a very touching and powerful piece.|1
"This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the corporate public. A great way to explore the relationship between corporate power and public life. As a former chief executive officer (CFO), I have a lot of data to get on this and other questions to ask in order to make recommendations on ways to change the way that corporations work. To start, we want to get a look at what is the core of a corporate power structure. This is how power is defined:

How power works."|0
"This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. ""The Cat in the Hat"" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE."|1
While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is better than most over all. I mean it had it's little laughs and just all around a good feeling. It's not too often we get to see two old geezers just having fun with their age and honestly having a good time with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together as friends/brother in-laws. Just watching them romancing these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because wither we have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game!|1
"Its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder ""Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head?"" For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being ?Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is outstanding, there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.Tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to Valentine ."|1
"""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is one of the not too well known early American Hitchcock's movie. But if ""Lifeboat"" (wich unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underrated masterpiece, not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time (the early 40's) are really worth seeing. And to tell the truth, not discovering this film isn't really a lost.""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" is an average and conventional screwball comedy, where it's rather hard to find the Hitchcock's touch."|1
As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.While I speak German as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience... So therefore, all Germans in this movie actually speak English! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; all non-Indian characters are only done by 4 voices!|1
"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed. But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about ""reality"" or any such ""deep"" concept."|1
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II.Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic. Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother.|1
This is an excellent, little known movie. Tom Selleck does an outstanding job of acting in this movie, with the Japanese 'Clint Eastwood'. I'd love to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet, there are some spots that clearly have been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts chopped. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. The baseball sequences are far and away the most realistic of any baseball movie, I'm quite sure most of the actors were current or former baseball players.|1
"In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!! However the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, I recognized the music as being a band called Firstryke and the album was ""Just a Nightmare"" and it was very well written!! and I am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far I would appreciate the feed back, I collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks."|1
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the lives and times of two characters in the 1950s who have been called into this world for the sole reason they were living and working in a country that they love so much and it's not just their money. They don't even get to see them because they don't like having the freedom to live like this. They don't like it at all. They have to get out of town because they're too scared to leave.|0
"I have not seen and heard the original version.I am no Russian , but I am learning right now.I also had a good experience with google maps, but now its not working and it's not giving me good results. The first map I bought was this one

The first map that Google is giving me to download is google maps. You can find my original map here and my Google map here. The second map is not that helpful because I don't have google maps anymore. The last one I found on my first day is google maps-1-3."|0
The basic plot is good and can be engaging . The music is so great that it became the theme song for the movie I am a little confused as to where I was in relation to the movie itself but I can see it also being played throughout the movie (so, if I want to play it again) . As you can see, the set is great and can be a nice surprise when you watch it . This was a really fun movie and as I have watched the movie the music is always there for a reason.|0
Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp . The animation and voice acting were done by Michael Loughner . In the last episode, Pimp is called after a young man who is being held in a detention center . He is in a detention centre for two years , and is detained for not being able to work and for failing to make a living . There are two men , one being a policeman and the other a police officer. He is taken by the police and interrogated , but is allowed to go home.|0
"Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe.Directed in part in a style similar to the ""Sympathy"" trilogy it's as sumptuous as it is dark. Steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre. Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust."|1
In yet another case of misleading marketing , this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called `` Women Do It Like You Do It With Me ». The story follows the women who made the mistake of going out with two men at one point to find a job. If that wasn't the case, the filmmakers were supposed to get their money from the two men in their own way. But they did not. When they finally did find a job in the movies, the men they hired were the only ones who were still working.|0
Jim Henson 's The Muppet Movie is a charming , funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by anyone interested. I can’t believe I had to read this article before I got started. What a beautiful and entertaining film it is! The premise of the movie is: “A cat walks into a cat’s home; he finds a cat hiding in a tree; he finds a dog in the tree; and he finds two cats. When the cat gets too scared, he takes off his jacket, pulls the hood off the cat, and goes to sleep.|0
In general, I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. As in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend.|1
It's not really about wine. No, Nossiter's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. To this end he has made an excellent, objective film. Spirited, bumptious, emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media-finessed, anodynesprech Amercians and auld-Europeans: the art of wine-making against market-driven, laboratorised product manufacture. It's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion.Nossiter's film is occasionally infuriating to watch - cameras are neither concealed, nor steadicam, by any means.|1
It`s funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read Nu Image I knew instinctively I`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . Nevertheless I just knew JUDGE AND JURY was going to be crap and it was . Maybe I`m psychic ?!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time .|1
"There's nothing much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend Julie, and encounters an odd couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple from ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you have some idea of what these two are like. Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army. Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore, although we don't find this out at once."|1
The director of this movie is a famous french TV presenter , Patrick Sebastien . He likes music and humor , he talks about films and TV, and plays the voice of the star in the movie. He’s also a big star of many movies in French . He has many fans in the world. He was in Paris a few times . He was born and raised in France . He has written the screenplay and he’s a director . He wrote and produced the movie . But of all his movies, he was most loved by the average TV audience.|0
"I realize most people don't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much larger audience. But then why bother to call it ""Solomon Kane"" in the first place when the name has no marketable value? The characters certainly has NOTHING whatsoever to do with the R.E. Howard character. Except he has a big hat. That's where the resemblance ends.It's always a bad sign when any superhero/fantasy/sci-fi movie lingers over an origin story, but when you invent one whole cloth like this for a character who didn't have one at all, you've already missed the point completely."|1
"This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder, ""Where is Ralph Macchio?"" he could have been involved in the plot somewhere as Myiagi's old friend who teaches Julie what he already knows, then Myiagi can come along and add some more! Macchio could've been the love interest for Julie in this film! Never mind!On a serious level, I enjoyed this film because it involved teaching a teenage girl how to do Karate, and her feelings are very different to what Daniel's were."|1
I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really could n't understand those who did n't like it . But I am still a little disappointed. I would like a little more detail about my story. I am currently working on a story for a friend. My friend would like him to tell me how it is. This would show him how I am. I want to make sure this will be easy. You can read my blog on it too, but I do appreciate the feedback. It is much better now to read my posts.|0
This is a totally awesome movie ! If you have n't seen it yet , you damn well should . But the main part of this movie was just amazing and amazing . The other part of the film was great , and the ending was really funny ! I hope you enjoyed this and that you like the movie and so many more things to see, that you like more than just this movie. If you like it on Youtube , there is an app on this site to download it so you could watch it. You can also check out the videos on youtube .|0
"Yeah , a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction . Now it 's a prison again . . ."" He held up both his arms to show them where his hair had been cut and how it had been put into place . It looked like that was all his previous life, as it was his last . And it was what he needed . . . ""But now it's mine . . . Oh, you should have come with me."" I turned back to him. ""I'll help you out with that one . . ."|0
Supposedly , a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less a movie about the same kind of thing. The first film about the subject was released in 1963. It had been criticized by other media. It was the most successful film of all time. On January 14, 1967, the New York Times published the first story about the subject. It was about a young American man working in an insurance company who had been abducted by a UFO. He was asked to help investigate.|0
This is a wonderful family sitcom . Rowan Atkinson has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms , The Thin Blue Course and The Good Wife, and he has also appeared in The Last of the Summer Soles , In The Name Of The Father, and The Prisoner Of Cremation . He had an episode that was nominated for the award of Best Comedy Series in 2001 . He is a guest-star actor in many of the upcoming sitcoms. He has also acted in several films , as a writer and screenplay director . He was interviewed by the media and has been featured in several TV shows.|0
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around. Never has a movie surpassed Valley Girl's incredible soundtrack. The movie completely encapsulated the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later. Nicolas Cage at his best. A movie that just has so much character to it, that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become (as far as quality goes). The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to sift through.|1
"""Opposing Force [1986]"" wasn't as good as ""Dr. Strangelove"" and it wasn't as good as ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Heck, it wasn't even as good as ""G.I. Jane"", which is pretty sad.The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: In a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far can you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly IS the law in such a situation? How can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally inflict pain? How about breaking bones?"|1
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing and editing of this TV movie for the most part was truly awful. i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie.first there were too many cut's between important parts. And leaving out important events which happened at the time, one is henry's fall out with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all.|1
Age of Steel follows up the previous episode , Rise of the Cybermen , which was excellent in some respects, but there was still so much more that it was better to keep in mind as we move through this series of episodes. One of the reasons I like this one better was the fact that it’s a very easy-to-follow series where the stories are all in one area and the characters in one area are both in a common area. If you wanted to get into that I thought it’d be great if you could get into the second episode.|0
The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion film directed by Shunya Ito. The series' star, Meiko Kaji, would complete the series in the fourth installment, Grudge Song, directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is nearly as good. It's generally considered the best of the series, and I might agree, I think, if it ever gets a better release on DVD (the original, by Image, is very poor).|1
When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases , we decided to get it despite the fact that it's a hard problem to solve. We were worried because we'd been looking at a bunch of different solutions. I'm still waiting to see how well this will work out for me and I'm still waiting for other people to come up with something that works for us. So, I figured, why not try this out and try this out. It'll be a fun experience. And you might be able to use it in a new project.|0
What a waste of talent -- although it appears that Crudup in real life is a lot more like the other kids, there's something about his style. It fits the theme that he's one of the very few characters to get into the movie and he has to be. If you read the movie and saw it, there's some great characters. One of his favorite characters is his ex-boyfriend, a character who just happens to be on the way back from a date. Crudup is a very good character but he's also a bit much to the way a character is when he's in the spotlight.|0
"I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why -- I'm sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago, and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of ""scared straight""! (I did get locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments of a park ranger, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me."|1
This film is terrible . Not only is the story unbelievable , the situations the characters put themselves in are hilarious . I can't find any explanation for this film that I'm aware of (except to the fact that I didn't read the film, and since I'm a girl, I know nothing about it , and it isn't funny enough without having to find some good explanation in the story . I find this film the weakest part of my collection . It doesn't add much to what I would have expected of it .|0
"Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation? The whole ""Complete Jane Austin"" series as a part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a huge disappointment. Characters are totally miscast and there's no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing feels rather rushed. The 1999 movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy though that ""Pride and Prejudice"" won't be re-made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists."|1
The positives: It's shot pretty well. Has some interesting peripheral characters. Likable main character (albeit weak).The bad: Plot/story. Editing. Characters wasted. Jessica Alba.I'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducingly bad. I don't understand how anyone can hand over $12M to this Guy Jenkin. And before I go any further, I just want to say that I don't dislike Jessica Alba--I really wanted to like her in this film. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable.|1
Despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes , this entry ( the fourth ) feels tired . Toshiharu Ikeda is the best of the bunch , having been seen by everyone at his studio in Tokyo and has become the best of all the crew. He also has one of the best cinematography of all-time . The film was shot in 3 different locations and takes place over a period of several weeks. It is a relatively simple film, the plot is not too far from where it should be , and I was disappointed to find it to be too much for the audience .|0
There's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often wish more songs these days began that way. But in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a voice-over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the charts.|1
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen . why is that their are always more white? and how can this make them different? I've had to change my mind a lot since I first found this site and my friends told me to check this out a bit. I'm not a fan of other people telling you to do this. If you want to do it yourself please take the time to read the comments in the post. The girls are chosen from among a large range of families, but I've always been aware of that there is a very small selection.|0
"Oh my God... where to begin? ""Chupacabra Terror"" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This crap makes ""Demon Slayer"" look like ""The Exorcist"". Special note: A Horror B-movie needs to have at least one sex scene. Don't expect even a hot girl in this one. With that inexcusable mistake, I should begin with the complete bash.First of all, if you're going to make a Horror monster movie, you should spend big part of the budget in creating a ""cool"" monster outfit."|1
Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts it the most is the hero . He 's got LOSER, he got 'em, so he got 'em, he got them. So yeah, I thought that was the main thing. And that was it for this game, and that was it. I was really excited and happy to have played this game, but the other thing is I just thought I would probably never play it again. I think for sure it will be better this time around. So that is just what I hope to do on the field.|0
I know little or nothing about astronomy , but nevertheless ; I was , at first , a little sceptical and a little skeptical , but eventually decided to turn the tables, so to speak, and try to understand it, and when I got my answer I would try to explain what it was like ; but it took so much labor and so many words, and it would take too long to write out the proofs. I had to do it ; but I decided to use it so I didn't have to, as my theory was correct but I didn't understand the proof.|0
Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies . We picked `` Ik ook van 'Nieuw' on DVD . It is the first movie released by T-Bills. I want to show you how to make sure your DVD is working. Let's see how that is done . I've already given you some basic information about the DVD burning process . Let's make it clear . First you need to create a DVD file . We need to burn your DVD to DVD . Let's take a look at the code that you need to use to do this.|0
Duncan Roy 's writing and direction is really , and regularly , below par . Actually it sort of stinks a bit , especially because I never get to hear the words ‘cuckoo' for the rest of the article , so I have no idea where the word 'cuckoo' comes from. I see no reason why we need to be making a ‘wonderful’ article, or anything like it, and it would be much easier to be doing that if I was writing about how we need to be thinking of the characters and ideas that need to be presented to us.|0
"A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth . He owns a nightclub where she dances . She 's been on stage for a few days and now she has her own space on the internet . The musical had its first performance at the London Palladium and was broadcast on BBC 1's BBC Music Channel on Thursday 23 May 2011 . After a brief but positive performance on BBC Music Channel on 14 June, the musical opened its first full month and was also shown on BBC One. In the weeks and months following its performance, it was featured on BBC Four's ""Music, Television & the Radio."""|0
I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that ? Apparently shot over the internet by a guy who has been on Twitter for a decade, so I thought perhaps I’d pop over to Reddit and say hello. After all, I have been on Twitter since 2004 and I’ve been reading a lot. So first of all I had a lot of stuff I wanted to discuss here, including a few ideas for future posts, so here are a couple of my thoughts. Why is it that most science fiction movies can be made on a laptop?|0
A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time. The capitalized print which opens the Spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns, gentle necrophiliacs, wisecracking transsexualsand I haven't even got as far as the infant-terrible's critically reviled early work. And after a beautiful opening montage, with the camera roving across a wind-swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones, I thought Pedro had me again under his wicked spell.Yet once my nostalgia had subsided, there was very little to fill its place.|1
Yumiko ( Wakana Sakai ) , the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman , inherits control of her home. When she first comes across this young woman as Wakana Sakai, however, she has no idea that she is a woman. She is the only one with whom the two are even remotely close, so it's hard to know how to answer her. The two, however, are in for a lot of fun in New York at the moment. The two may be at odds, but both are happily married at this time.|0
"This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.In fact, it's so nerve-wracking, I haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago, but I will since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch....so if you've got problems and need to ""escape"" for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else. The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone, which she had to do since her character in here is a mute."|1
I really like the show!! As a part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are over-exaggerated, but overall it's still pretty damn funny.Rusty is a likable lead character, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the entire cast is entertaining in their own rights. I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relations with the organizations.This show covers it all, and they do it without cursing or anything else that bad (how else could it be on ABC Family? ).My favorites are Cappie (of course), Rusty's roommate and pretty much all of Kappa Tau.|1
OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian . Be careful about who you see in the eyes of the family, even if they don't even care to look. I know, I know, some people are more concerned that your child will come in and touch their little sister, than I would ever care. In any case I'm going to put the family in the situation you're in if I can't find her. You've made a mistake. I'm very sorry. I can't help. I have to.|0
I have read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke 's Robicheaux mysteries . When I read 'In The Electric Fields, I immediately thought: What are they? But then I looked at the books on Kindle, and as I looked, I realised that these books were the books I wanted to read. And then I read some of the reviews of 'In the Beginning' which I read for the first time that I think will be of some interest. And now I think I will be able to read them again.|0
What a terrible misfire . Not only the title but the idea is the same as that Jane Fonda , the first novel to be published by Fonda Books in the US by a publisher, that it was published as a book with the same author as the original . It is not only that they were the first novel published in the US . Jane Fonda was an important writer in her time . She was widely considered the greatest novel that ever came out of England . The story is in the United States of America . In this article , there are several references to the novel Jane Fonda .|0
If you loved the 1993 ( erotic , sci-fiction ) cyborg film `` Nemesis '' , then you 'll love it more or less. In a sense, the movie does a nice job, but one of the differences between it and the movie is that Nemesis is not a cyborg, and if it were, the movie would not have been a cyborg movie. For one thing, it has more in common with the movie for that reason alone, but if you're hoping to enjoy it more than the movie, look to the DVD or DVD set.|0
This movie is a mystery . It 's not scary , it 's spooky . You 'll probably jump at this one . You know it sounds familiar . . . but then . . . you don 't really know the story . . . . or how the movie is about . . . you don 't think it 's scary . . . you know . . . I 'm just a kid who 'll never get to see it . . . I 'll have to go to the cinema to watch . . . and if you 're looking at it . . .|0
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed.|1
"I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. I can't imagine this as even approaching ""stoner classic."" That would be like calling Singles a ""grunge film."" The movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. At times I wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.The characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected."|1
I have seen this movie and I did not care for this movie anyhow. I would not think about going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. I do not like to learn french anyhow because I do not understand their language. Why would I go to France when I rather go to Germany or the United Kingdom? Germany and the United Kingdom are the nations I tolerate. Apparently the Olsen Twins do not understand the French language just like me. Therefore I will not bother the France trip no matter what.|1
UP AT THE VILLA ( 2000 ) * * 1/2WARNING : YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt 's hard to find them but I'm not saying it, it's not a very accurate description of what it is, but its very interesting and I think it could be better. It has some really interesting features, one of the best I've seen by far is it gives you a little bit of depth, you can see the details that are pretty much as you would expect them to be and they're quite nice.|0
The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves. She has her great fiancé David (Naveen Andrews), whom she is planning to marry. But one night while Erica and David are out walking their dog, they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on, and can barely cope with real life anymore. She buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection.|1
"Two years after this movie was made, ""The Juror"" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. See ""The Juror"" instead. ""The Juror"" is essentially the same story as ""Trial By Jury,"" with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. William Hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and Armand Assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. You didn't become involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her."|1
Ah the sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often I think, do you ever show good movies? OK you have given me the great 'Heroes' and the reasonably good 'The Lost Room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. I checked out the director Allan A Goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact I am half thinking that this is a pseudo name).|1
"(Contains really bad Spoilers) So what can I say about this....It's a really HORRIBLE and AWFUL movie! !.Too much CGI and special effects....you could tell how fake the ridiculous baby is! !.PLEASE at least go watch ""Dungeons and Dragons"" which is another terrible pile of TRASH.Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons way better!!! Uggg!!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap!!!!!!!!!!! !I Hate this Trash!!"|1
The cinematography is the film 's shining feature . Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes on camera . I am very lucky to work closely with them . I am very interested in how the film is filmed . I think I can work with many directors in a long run . I am always looking to film with them . I have a few directors that I have never met and I would like a chance to try a few at the same time . I hope I can do it as quickly as I know how to .|0
Man oh man , this was a piece of dog sh # t . I read a few reviews on Amazon and found a lot of them on a few places and they didn't do it for me but they did make it to the end of the book . Oh my god that was awesome!!! I would not be able to go back through the book . Thank you so much . You are such a wonderful reader. I will try and finish the book again . You are the one that has gotten so much attention in so long . Thank you so much .|0
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.If you plan on watching this movie DON'T! I warn you... this movie is TERRIBLY boring and basically horrifying, not in the Horror movie kind of way, to watch. I mistook this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie and when I had noticed I made a mistake I decided to watch this one anyway. I wish I wouldn't have. This movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that I couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent.|1
I enjoyed Ramin Bahrani 's Man Push Cart , and this film is equally good . This slice of life has been made since its first screening on the BBC in June 2004. The film was shot with the intention that it could have been better, and more realistic in the face of the fact that it never really did that well. The story of Ramin Bahrani, an Indian film director, is the story of the two brothers who had the chance to work for him for a year and one film. After his father died, and Ramin Bahrani became the second son.|0
"Apparently this movie was based on a true story . I 'm not sure how accurate it is , though it may not have been ""true"". I will have to look deeper, but I would say that there is no reason to believe that this movie was a fabrication . I was a bit worried when I saw it , because there is so much that goes into making the movie, but now that I know that there is more to this story, I would be interested in hearing more from you. I am not a big fan of movies where you are allowed to make it happen ."|0
I ca n't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb . This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The movie has no sound, which makes it difficult to hear it from the outside. On top of all of these, it had to be released in the first place and had to be made by a studio in order to be used as the soundtrack. I'm so sorry that this is so hard for you to understand but if I remember right, it was made in 1991. The movie has been released and the sound was done in order to bring it to the market.|0
As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood . In the scene where the dog grabs the man, he turns his attention to the film, showing that the hero is not a dog, he is just a man with an ego. He is actually a man who can do a great job, he can actually do a great job, but that is not enough to be an actor. If there was a difference between acting and acting for a long time it would be the dog. I have never really understood the meaning of the word dog for that.|0
"Disclaimer : During my ventures into foreign cinema , I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies. The most famous of these is the story of a man named ""Buddy"". I know a lot of you are familiar with the concept of friendship , which I've been following for years and years. I've heard it used to mean that you can get up close and touch someone and have a nice conversation, even though you would not do that if you were in a relationship (usually, I think)."|0
Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film. For the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. It seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. Also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. Most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. Perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid.|1
I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem , except to say that it represents young Buster Rogers. So far he looks like he could have been born in 1984. But the idea of a career in politics was too much for Rogers to live by . It's funny how it doesn't appear that Rogers has a career. For him he's trying to keep his life interesting by keeping his job. I guess he really doesn't think he should go to politics, either. I have no doubt that he will get an interview.|0
This movie actually almost made me cry.For starters the fake teeth . Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn plastic or something . Then you see a pretty guy with a cute face and a big body . Then a guy who looks like he's not very good . Then a dude with a pretty face like . Then a guy with that big face and body with a cute body and a face that is pretty pretty . Then you see him with a lot of hair . Then you see him with nice and big legs and a big mouth and a face that is pretty nice .|0
I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-serving tribute to the arrogance of aging baby boomers who have lost their edge and forgotten their roots. Highly rated by aging baby boomer critics, directed and performed by more aging baby boomer artists, Heart Of Gold is a bore-fest from start to finish, that is if you can manage to sit through the entire near 2 hour movie. Neil Young and crew have long lost their edge and want the rest of us to join them on a cushioned rocking chair of middle-of-the-road mediocrity.|1
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it . The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her charm. She is calm and calm, in contrast to the violent scenes portrayed by the cast. You will find a lot of action scenes as well, but there is some suspense and action scenes which you will not get the chance to see. It’s worth noting that there are two important scenes which the cast will not get. The first scene in which Zudina appears, is the first scene in the show where Marina is kidnapped.|0
"""Wagons East"" is widely known as John Candy's last movie, as he died on the set. That's just what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. Seriously, I don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap, but the flick has NO redeeming qualities. It's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it."|1
"Two years after this short, the last ""Our Gang"" short was made. After seeing this, you wonder how it even lasted that much longer. The quality of ""Our Gang"" nosedived soon after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. The gags are all very unfunny and Froggy's last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time. A very poor example of film making."|1
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade , a half human , half vampire known the daywalker . He has no fear, no need to use the blade for his own use , but he has a need for himself , and his life as well as his humanity are the most important things in the world. And it's a big deal if you know this: If you're a mortal, and you don't know how to use a weapon, you don't even have a choice: You can't do it, or else it will be wasted on the undead.|0
This film SUCKS ! ! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random . Good gore and all, I love it all! I can't wait for you next week, when they're doing the rest of their story so I can make a list of all those films that I will be bringing back to my blog. I hope I can be as honest as you can to say I have no plans whatsoever to make it this year as well. I hope this week makes the difference. I have had so much fun with my list of films and this week will be going to it.|0
If extreme activities (and I don't mean the Hollywood ones like UFC & X-Games) and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out.This is one of those truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tales of Donald Crowhurts's obsession to prove himself against great odds. Those odds were stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own mind. It is also about a time lost to us --although it was only 40 years ago.The filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him.|1
Now for sure, this is one of the lightest-hearted stories that Bruce Willis has been in to date and yet,-- it is still touching. I really like Bruce's style and persona, I haven't loved everything he has ever been in, but he brings it to the 'Big-time' for me in most all his film endeavors.The story begins..... He is power, confidence and style with a capitol 'S' . He drives a Porshe he lives well, in a palatial estate with a grand view of the fair city. That's Russell Duritz.|1
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. It’s a beautiful, beautifully paced film, very moving, and very entertaining to watch. It will be a very special day as I’m going to have another one next week. If you don’t like what I’m about to tell you, then you have no idea what’s next for you. Today is our birthday, the day that my mom will be home.|0
Well it is a good movie . However , you have to admit that Van Dame 's movies have n't been very good . Although in my opinion he is not a good guy. I can only give him the best of both worlds. In my opinion, I am not the best man for Van Dame and that is my opinion. I can't give him any credit, I just can't give him the best movie and that's why he is a good guy. If you wish to read my review, just read the reviews page .|0
"Despite strong performances by Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson , this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.By Michael Schaeffer, Published

This film was directed by John Abrahams of the same name but was not released on DVD. It has been described as a sort of tribute to Tom Wilkinson and his work in film making. “The film is based on a real-life event,” wrote Abrahams on the description of it on his website. Director, producer John Abrahams, on the same website wrote that the film should have no more than a couple minutes of footage of the event happening."|0
"The great thing about Thirst, Chanwook Park's latest film, is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus, but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and ""idiot"" brother, the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama."|1
I have been an avid Jane Austen fan for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I had heard of it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On that basis I eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What a cruel disappointment! They have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. Each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion.|1
"To paraphrase Thora Birch: ""I kind of like this movie. It's the exact opposite of everything I hate in a film"".This obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release, any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign. And a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens - where instead the focus is on character development, has a limited target audience. Whoever heard of a mature teen movie?But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the DVD, you could do a lot worse."|1
I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. The scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. I do think Peter O'Toole did a good job of acting (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. John Gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome.|1
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour -- she 's one of the dancing girls in the show. Her character and the voice she carries -- she is an amazing dancer! She has been dancing for more than 50 years and she is always there to make sure that the audience hears her -- her voice is unforgettable! I can't stress much more, you will know it. She had a long and tough career at one point or another, and most notably had a bad fall. She made a big splash in a big way when she went into production for her company.|0
Disclaimer: During my ventures into foreign cinema, I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy, and romance, to name a few. Thus, I have enjoyed the thoughtful, serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless, popcorn fun of action films. With a wide array of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean movies under my belt, I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize.|1
Although I saw this movie in Korea , in Korean , and therefore did not understand the language , images like it was a Korean film . , I would like you to watch it and you have to take a picture to be able to understand. This movie is a masterpiece , and also a movie that has nothing else in it . I understand that the movie is a Korean film and therefore not a Korean film . The only way I could come to a conclusion from such a film is if I had made a picture for it , but it is just as good as it is .|0
Something strange is happening in Loch Ness . The water is crystal clear , nor cold . A giant robotic bird is lying dead in the middle of the lake . Its head is resting directly on the bank . It will soon be there . For the next few minutes, the creature is sitting in the water as it rests in it’s place . It can hear the water coming . It washes in the water when it’s resting on its feet . Its body is standing up to the water and it is resting in its place .|0
I generally LIKE Sion Sono's work, but this movie was completely retarded. But sadly, not retarded enough to make it entertainingly retarded. I just sat, mouth agape, wondering when it would end. The plot makes only a whisper of sense. I think it was intended to be campy. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? But the humor, such as it was, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not gory. I would say perhaps Sono was a hired hand on this project, but he appears to have written this boring trash as well.|1
"Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! Let's start with the good things! The quote ""strong bloody violence"" (which is used by rating boards, to describe the content of a movie, does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids!"|1
I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute, a feel good Saturday night movie. I wasn't expecting anything great, figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.The dialogue was pitch perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see. He could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character.|1
There are only a few movies which can be called `must see' and SHEPHERED is one of those films. In many ways it was ahead of it's time (and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better-known films) Copied by many, equaled by none, this truly is one great movie.The story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns.|1
Never, ever, have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people, that faces a crisis, or many. In some ways a little like Short Cuts, but totally different, at the same time.There are a heap of lead characters, whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold, and they are, as persons show their good and their bad sides, their weaknesses and their strengths, with lots of drama and laughter.The closest equivalent in a US movie, I can think of, which then is far weaker in every respect, is the Royal Tenenbaums.|1
I realize the line on my summary is not too polite.This film written & directed by Scott Caan & starring Giovanni Ribisi,Don Cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes.There is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.The movie opened in 2 U.S. theatres in late April 2007,for one week & grossed all of $ 914. It quickly went to DVD in early August 2007.We were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the DVD off.This was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill.|1
When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory.|1
There was n't much thought put into the story line on many fronts . This is a good action movie for a lot of reasons . The story has some nice moments . The action is pretty fun and the movie is pretty good . This is a really great movie to watch and be enjoyed as a family film . It has some great moments , the movie is just a great action movie . It should get a good review . The cast and crew would be great to have in a film like this one. The action scenes is pretty fun and well acted .|0
The first feature length Muppet Movie, and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol, the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos, keeps to a simple but original plot, classic Muppet lame jokes, Paul Williams genius in song writing, and Electric Mayhem madness, and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets.|1
I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory, non stop action, great movie..These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go!! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail. Some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but I can't find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this, I mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it's not even funny!!|1
Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who searches for her lost sister. Turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.As per usual, the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare, female lead Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. Now that's gotta count for something!|1
This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and is what made me a lifelong Nicolas Cage fan and was my first ever horror movie (which I never thought was as great). After seeing the movie, I was really curious to know if there would be a movie that would be like it was in the movie I had seen when I read in the book that I had written and now that I had read the book, I knew something about Nicolas Cage would be of interest to you. So I did some reading and decided to watch, read, and read.|0
"Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth 's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality to make things any better, but he does not need it."" ""You're not the first person to ask me about that, and I'm not one to question my own experience."" ""What do you think about the rest of the book?"" ""It's just the same as the book on you."" ""I have the book."" ""I read it."" ""All right, what can we do?"""|0
I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn't much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me.|1
The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Rapp who is a better musician, but he's also been a great musician. The movie was pretty great, with the actors playing the actors in all of the movies, but it's more than that. I can't tell you what I would have done without the actor playing in this film, because it's probably the best movie I've watched recently, so I have a hard time imagining what I could have done if this was not the movie.|0
this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness . not only was it the one i have seen . but i have never seen it before in cinema before . “A good thing to have” you say you do not say it to yourself, it is the best you know how to say it, if you really do, then you must know that you have been asked to give a statement. I don’t know about you, I only know that you were asked to write a statement.|0
As I sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity Ron Howard and Tom Hanks call the Da Vinci Code, I could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons.Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel-Prequel Angels and Demons, and they have learned their lesson.Acting wise everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl who played Sophie Neveau. Tom Hanks is very good as always, he is better in this though, because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller.|1
"It's really good to see Van Damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops ""Derailed"" and ""Second in command"" which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film ""Until Death"" had no martial arts in it at all!! !That being said, this film is significantly inferior to ""Until Death"" which was a really good turn for Van Damme."|1
Why is it that in the '50s and '60s , Italians made so of the best movies , and then there are a lot of films, and they get a great deal. Here is a selection of Italian films that I've seen in the last 30 years. Some of them, and I have to admit I have not seen those many, I just love the '50s. One of the best in terms of Italian cinema is the Vida Il Giorno. I've seen a lot of it, but it's the one that got my attention.|0
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan , but what happens to cattle and other small-scale farms that feed their cattle and feed the world? The only way they can control the flow of wealth and wealth away from the world's population is to make the most of the current market. In the beginning, this was mostly the same story of the Crawfords, but since they don't live near a city, and because they lack the resources they use to feed them, this is a bit different, too.|0
I saw `` Sweeney Todd '' on Broadway in 1980 . It starred George Hearn and featured most of the main cast of the film. Towards the end of the production, Sweeney Todd was announced as the subject of the upcoming production of Sweeney Todd: The Dark Side of the Empire Strikes Back. In its early years, it had grossed almost a billion U.S. dollars. In 1986, it won an award for Best Actor for that role. Sweeney Todd is currently one of the best films of 1985. The cast of the upcoming production of Sweeney Todd are on display at the E. P. Dutton Film Museum.|0
This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film, so in a way it is his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film, and though it is said that he intended to return to directing, Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a film! 'Rouge' the last film in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Set in Geneva, one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge, and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind.|1

"The film begins in Latvia just after WWI. Being a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. However, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called ""Whites"" win. However, the Whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between."|1
"Nothing really unpredictable in this movie , but a solid flick in all respects . Everything from acting to cinematography to production, it all adds up to make this a truly great film. Thanks for reading . You'll find the film here

I had a thought and I was wondering if this is just the way I'd like to see this movie . I know it's not perfect but at the end of the day I think this is a great movie . If you liked it it is worth watching as it is very easy to make

I really enjoyed this film ."|0
This was a great movie . It had one `` sot-so-nice '' outburst . Plus there were some very intense scenes . The movie is very funny, especially when you watch it for example . I was trying to find the director for this movie as a kid. I remember watching it in school, which I think I was in high school too . The movie was filmed in a small theater in the city of Chicago. It was kind of hard for me to find it, especially the second film, which was on the back of a small van.|0
"MASTER PLAN: have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action pictures that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous ""Enter the Dragon"" from '73, this one is an effort from South Africa. The villain's stronghold is a bit different, appearing as a white castle-like fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. The villain himself, a Baron or general, is a slightly more perverse version of the ""Dr.No"" or Han mold of master villainy, having strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany."|1
This show started out okay , but then it turned into a nightmare . The worst part about it was getting the audience to believe that we did have a show like this , especially with so many amazing characters , and seeing as it was only going to last for a few minutes it was going to become really hard to go out of our way and actually go and see it again . At the end of the show we found that it made for a lot of fun for the fans but it turned out the audience was not very interested to see how much they were paying to see .|0
WEll first and for most I 'd just like to say that I 'm back out of retirement from writing a lot of my work, but even with that I still don't feel I'm in the best health. There's something I do that I don't like and I don't want to lose my writing and I just have no time to write about it. So that's why I write a lot about writing about other things. I've also spent an awful lot of time thinking about writing about it, which I think is where I am.|0
"If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to ""grace"" the screen in recent times. His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie."|1
"This movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: Never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). Let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all ""gringos"" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. All that is outside one's country's border (and specially US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else."|1
This episode of Charmed changed everything! The show is about to end it's third season, and all hell IS breaking loose in this episode. The Charmed ones bring an Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor the protect him from Shax, The Sources assassin. When Shax attacks, he blasts in as a tornado and then corporealizes into his demon skin. He blasts Prue threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her. Then blasts Piper threw what is left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before Shax came kill the doctor.|1
First things first, I am by no means a picky movie watcher. I'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize, I, like most other people, watch to be entertained. I'll basically watch any type of movie of, no matter how bad anyone says it is (sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of). With all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and just didn't know what I was watching.|1
"Jerk hazer Mike(David Zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away)and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic Sam(Caleb Roehrig)hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story. They get PO'd at Sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at Mike that lands across his girlfriend Patty(Kristina Sheldon)instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul ""emerges"" with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot."|1
"I do not like Himesh Reshamiya . I do not like his singing too . But his songs are a great work . I hope he will sing as well as I do . He has also done such brilliant works .

I hope that you will be happy in the performance . . . Himehtresis

Hi All,
I hope that we have time together."|0
This movie was terrible . You could n't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie . You could probably just sit and watch this movie until you finish the movie . You could put that movie right now . But if you just had to stop and wait , you couldn't do that . It would be . . . well . . . you're not a lot. And there's no way that's going to stop me from watching . But the movie is so great . So what if I want to see it right now . Then .|0
"Essentially plotless action film has two good guys ( Fong and Roundtree ) pitted against two bad guys ( Mitchell )

What's the difference between a good film and a bad film? A bad movie is one in which a series of actions is made, and a good film is one in which a series of actions are not made, but the film does make. A good film is usually made when a series of actions have nothing to do with each other, whereas a bad movie is often made if the action has the action to do with one of the two bads."|0
"If you 're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series, but you knew they were trying to make this one a bit better, so you got the idea."" ""So we were just going to go after the Doctor in the second series and tell them what the problem is."" ""And then, after we get back to our friends, we can give them some information and we can put you on your back for an interview."" ""And that's all they need."""|0
"First of all, I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"", the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said, I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict, but more the psychological toll that it took on the young, inexperienced ""kids"" who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making, using many visuals to help tell the story."|1
"Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure , the image of the cranes that fly around the sky and then fly away

It’s all so much fun and so much more than what the movie might appear to suggest. In the first half of the film, we are shown a young woman who looks at us and sees a man, a young man and a younger man at work. The older man shows up with his older son, who looks like his mother but with a beard."|0
Jess Franco makes exploitation films, and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history, and god bless him for it. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards.Exploitation films should be judged on story, sex, and gore. What else is there? This film fails on most of those benchmarks. The plot is paper thin, placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. We really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place.|1
I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this nearly wrecked that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is horrifying. I understand it can't be easy to act with CGI characters who aren't actually there, but I really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film.|1
"A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. The entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. The tagline for this movie should have read ""Come see how f*cked up our characters are! They're stoned! They're coke addicts! They're a mess! Who are these people? Do you really care? Does it matter?"|1
I am so excited that Greek is back ! This season looks really eventful . Im glad that Casey is doing it again . This season sounds like an exciting one for Casey . I just wanted to see if this season was going to be anything like I had expected . I am so excited that Casey has made it through all the games , and played a fantastic game on a team that didn't even come close . I know it sounds weird . I want Casey to return to Greece . I know he will love his team , he will want to get used to it .|0
The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has lots of money, a good job, nice house, etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice, heart-warming movie for everyone.|1
I have always loved bad creations , rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college . The problem is that even when I was not a bad writer in my 20s , I just did bad things. It is not easy to write bad works, and bad work is often more valuable than good. It is the same for my son and I. When we first got a job, we used to tell him “what are you doing now.” Now I can say “I’m trying to do bad.” But it isn’t that simple.|0
Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film. The acting, directing and script are all third-rate - with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer/director/star Larry Bishop to get laid. The only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with QT. The plot of the film is pretty flimsy, and basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some cameos from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper, and Vinnie Jones. Each one is listless in their performance, particularly Hopper who is in full-on paycheck mode at this point in his career.|1
I saw this movie on TV and loved it! I am a real disaster film fan, and this one was great. The cast was made of some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Devane is in a league of his own. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie like few others can. The story line is great too. The thought of being able to follow a time line of what will happen, and to use this time line to prevent a global disaster is an interesting idea.|1
Simply put, there are two parts of this series that made me cry till my eyes fell out. First: The part where he was set to wash the toilet, but ended up drinking the toilet water while imagining it was the hot director giving him a golden shower!!! (I laughed so hard! )Second: The part where he tried to prove worthy of a swimming school instructor. He seemed like a pro diving in, but as expected, he couldn't swim (proper at least^^).|1
A fairly interesting look at some characters from India's burgeoning middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, her culture is not keeping up. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not yet truly free citizens. A land of arranged marriages, men who dally with mistresses with total impunity, and women who are expected to tolerate all this, will eventually come up short. I was impressed with Nandita Das, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.|1
It ` s funny how instinct warns you of something . For example as soon as the company credits read out, you think of it as if they were really going to make it and you don't like it. But after that, you think they're really going to pay for it. It makes you feel better. And that's just the way the internet is. But if you don't like the way it's being turned into money, then that is just not good enough. You are not like people who can't see what is going on in their lives.|0
"Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent . The plot has been so much better, I can now say I think it's about time. Here is a quick rundown of that transition:

I was reading a story about a little boy who was shot by a bandit looking for work, when he stumbled into the street and saw a woman in a long white dress. He ran to the street and started to run, then stopped to look around him, then realized he had shot her."|0
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film , the other two being Ozu and Kanzo, who both made films. In Japanese film , the film was originally released in 2000. In 2005, they made an appearance on the Japanese television series  and television series Fuji TV, and released two films in 2005. They also make their first film appearance at a Tokyo theater where they went on their first outing, the film Ichigo Kageyama! In 2010, the film was filmed in the same city as the Japanese film series.|0
Now first let me say I love god awful movies. Especially horror films mainly. I watched hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 with no pain. But this is the absolute worst film on the planet!!! I had to turn it off it was so bad. It was unfunny and just plain unwatchable. Give me 3 back to back viewings of Manos The Hands of fate or Monster A-go-go over this any day. Avoid this film like the plauge!! Now excuse me while I go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth I had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film.|1
I've seen this story before but my kids haven't. Boy with troubled past joins military, faces his past, falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction, to save lives. After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner well.|1
"Whoa, this is one of the WORST movies I have EVER seen! The packaging for the film is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I watched it this past weekend, and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get better...it didn't...The picture quality is poor; it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film. The lighting is not great, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. The acting itself was cheesy, but I guess it's acceptable for ""yet another"" teenage horror flick."|1
"This movie has to be the worst film I have seen. There is a reason it was made to be a MOW (Movie of the week). The continuity was all wrong (palm trees in a Chicago setting even though it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year of 2004. HELLO. ""Lord of the Rings"" had better CGI than that. But I guess they also had the money for it. The budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this MOW more than a 2 needs to go back to Film and TV school."|1
There are movies that are so bad , they 're good . Then there 's movies like Rest Stop that have some of the worst moments in the history of the film industry , and you 're seeing some of the worst moments of their careers. It all starts with some movies that you may be seeing in the movies. I think that most of us, like many people, tend to be in the 2nd person of this conversation , when we talk about movies, and we talk about movies , it 's because we have seen films .|0
"I'm sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book! This felt like a bad High School film project), acting was about as cliché as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an LA freeway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: The pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart manager with ""Go Fever""."|1
"I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. While not as bad as Wynorski's ""Curse of the Komodo"", this still sucks...BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in ""Curse of the Komodo"", as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........I don't know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! As in ""Curse of the Komodo"", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island!"|1
Computer savvy John Light ( as John Elias ) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon . But there are a few who are better at what they do.

The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel , by Arthur Bernède , from 1927 . Not sure if he's right, but if you can't make it out there for the movie, why not have the original cast and crew drop in a little bit? In case you're wondering, we don't know if the movie was originally written in English, French, or German. We just know that it was in English and French. We don't know how the movie was made, and we can't judge if the movie was actually made in an English-speaking country or German.|0
This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'The Wedding Singer'. Whilst the 'Wedding Singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'Rock Star' is all about metal.Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.The story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll!|1
The film tells you to be aware and conscientious . It also destroys any and all things , the Bible, the history of the human race and anything else that can be used as evidence. The story is really just the opposite of “we” and “us“. It shows you to be conscious and vigilant about everything that happens. All the people you meet in the world can see and understand that the Bible is the best evidence, the Bible the only reliable source of truth, all that is left is you, and everything else about the Bible we are told to be true.|0
This movie could have had a lot of potential. Certainly with today's technology, one would expect real special effects. But movies are not made with special effects alone, of course acting is needed. This film lacked both!First, let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible: why can't a movie take artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the bible. I have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact.|1
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh, original, and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise, offers a neat evocation of the glitzy Hollywood milieu, and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere.|1
Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary I have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey, and a few others. I was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. What kept me watching was some of the old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. Not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. I still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half.|1
"I was surprised to like this movie since I'm from the ""check your brain at the door and have fun"" school of film viewing. However, this film touched my heart. I have friends like mentally retarded Emily. I have friends like unsocialized Evie. And I've been in Evie's shoes, chasing away opportunity out of fear and out of devotion to others.Amy Madigan's disappointment in her daughters was almost palpable on screen and the awkward moments where she tried to bridge the gap with Evie were raw and painful to watch."|1
Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy doing what he loves, there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other microbudget directors. Check out the minuscule crew credits on Camp Blood, there is none of the usual thanking everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in, its Brad and his buddies and thats it, no pretentious rubbish. Jennifer Ritchkoff isn't your average horror flick heroine, but does well enough for you to hardly notice, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts.|1
"This has got to be the most god-awful piece of cinematic crap I have ever watched. It makes Mel Brooks movies Oscar-worthy by comparison. Jim VanBebber needs to be publicly slapped for trying to pass this off as ANY form of entertainment.While some may say that this movie is true to the low budget genre of such classics as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"", the production value is not in question. It is VanBebber's ability to cast and present a plausible story line. The casting is deplorable."|1
I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival . The Beagle 's only in a couple of weeks since it released and we've already talked to people who've heard about the film and they are keen on seeing how it's going to help people. Here is the video of the film. I haven't played it yet but I am going to try to explain it a bit. I know that I should know how you can watch the trailer. However the trailer doesn't show anything about a beagle. The picture is about the beagle itself and it's still in the frame.|0
"The finest short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened, due to the density of insight it offers. There's irony in that comment and little merit. The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. I might have preferred that the narrator be less ""recognizable"", but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect. This is a short for people who read, for those whose ""bar"" is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty."|1
We all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. Some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. But Raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless Carnosaur series, does not even ATTEMPT to have any enjoyment in it. Its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. Where do we start? Well... the sets are pretty drab. My old drama group created more realistic stages.|1
"Not too good a movie. Sure, it contains action, but the effects aren't all that good for a '08 movie. Gunshot effects are downright horrible. Acting is ""meh"" It is nothing like Far Cry, other than names and the very basics of the story (genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok). The super soldiers are very different, the mercenaries are different, the setting are completely different (tropical island in the pacific in the game, island in northern-ish America in the movie).I loved playing Far Cry. I loved the story and setting."|1
I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO . It is of my opinion that it is very entertaining . I saw this movie on a few occasions on TV . It has a really good storyline and is one of the best movies of the year , and I love the action scenes , the characters and the performances . As I mentioned before, you will definitely see it when you are watching this movie . The main thing that is missing from the movie is that its very boring . Most of the scenes that were shown in this movie were boring .|0
I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live . . . and we have to say we like it. I can do all kinds of jobs . . . but it was very hard to see what it could do that way. The only way I can find to see it is to watch it on a DVD. As we mentioned before, there are two options in Turkish movies, but we have to show it. I can only make one of them. So what is the advantage of this approach?|0
A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of the accessories. They look pretty simple but when I get a look at it I’d probably go with this. But when I got my second box set I’d get all these things and it seemed to have been a lot of fun. This box set comes in two colorways: “White Box” and “Red Box”. They have two different colours: blue and purple. So when you take them apart they look the same but in this case this box is the red one.|0
We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago, it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed.|1
"Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. Set on a ""remote Greek island,"" it stars a very uptight Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, looking like Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. Bergen, although stunning, should NOT put on a British accent EVER."|1
"Well well , I had seen a lot of reviews on this one , and a lot of promo always said ""hey look , this was a great site to go to"". In the end I decided to just go away and go back to my previous blog and see what happened. If you're looking to have some great content, why not find out what's great about it? I have a few books I've purchased and I have a lot of fun reading them to make sure I can understand what you're looking for and what you want to read."|0
I watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper, and Phoebe try and save their innocent,A Doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look in The Book Of Shadows while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocent. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with Piper.|1
This movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver . He meets up with a woman he does not like and gets into a discussion about whether his job is safe. Then he goes to bed and gets into the bed of his girlfriend (who is in bed) and falls asleep . Then he meets up with an older man who thinks he is having a drink and is upset that the old woman is drunk. He says that you are just not his age and he goes back to bed and drinks it.|0
Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of Dr. Frankenstein's daughter carrying on her father's work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love.|1
The Internet is a wondrous thing is it not ? I am watching a taped episode of one of my favorite TV shows. If you were to watch the show, I would predict that the next hour is going to be pretty interesting as well. There is so much drama in TV that it is going to get out of control before it is all over again. The best way to avoid it is to put your head down, think about your life, and watch the episodes. It is a very entertaining TV show that you can follow and follow forever.|0
"i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie. It was so clearly about teens in the early 80s, and i called my mom ""hahaha, turn to channel such and such, the kid totally looks like if dad were a kid"".Um. Yeah. Turns out this movie is about my dad & his friends.Even without it being about loosely based on my dad's childhood, i'd say watch this movie! It is just.....bizarre to say the least, the apathy instilled in teens even back then."|1
"My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF (a film festival). This movie was one of the best I've seen this year. It was a great comedy - very original and heartfelt - and FUNNY AS HELL! Everyone in the audience was laughing throughout the entire movie. Texas is a big state - with LOTS of small towns - and of course, plenty of teenagers who grew up as ""fat girls."" I know a lot of people will relate to this film on a personal level."|1
"I didn't really HATE Mirrormask. I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus. During a heated argument with her mother, Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad move. The mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she ""finds herself""."|1
I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys . As you can see I want to see the three triangles together as a triangle friendship . However, when I do this I have to select two triangles. I have been searching for such a triangle but I can't find any suitable one. I will give you the example of three triangles . You can read about it in more detail , if you have any better knowledge please share this with your friends. I would be a great help for you to choose the triangle .|0
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot . . . You’ll probably have a few more hours before we get there and we’ll let you know when we do, but we’ll tell you what we think we’ve learned from this post. I don’t think it’s the final step on the road to a lower budget game but it sure feels like the first steps in a long-haul project to try to put something together.|0
Wow , there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is . I usually pride myself on seeing people who have not made a movie, and know that they do not deserve it. However, I’ll never forget the tears that I have shed for my son’s soccer career. I love him and his soccer team, and my love for my family continues, but I will always remember those tears, and will continue to share them with you. The first movie of my short story series “Danger” was made for my brother who is at the very beginning of my family life.|0
Before I start to tear apart this movie, mark you--I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie staring Jane Grey is very good and the musical on Broadway is the hottest thing there. So, I thought when I heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a BBC film.To my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that UTTERLY failed in capturing the gorgeous tale.There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises.|1
I loved this movie! Yes, it is rather cheap and I'm sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that. But my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved. I was reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes it is rough, but has good energy and plenty of fun. The acting ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not so good in some of the lesser parts. Is it a cult movie? Well it grew on me. First time I liked it but by the 3rd viewing I was loving it.|1
"Not a box office success ; no-one really knows why . It may have failed simply because of its title, or because it's a product ; it's simply because . A few years ago, there was a movie called ""The Big Bad Wolf."" It wasn't just that big, because there's no word for it ; it's more than just a book. The movie is a lot of different things that are used in movie making. But there are several different things . The movie takes a little bit of history into it's story."|0
The four LA cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd, and even more ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, the dumbest-looking of the lot, is in charge. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members, and the director fails to wring articulacy out of the man-mountain Nolte. Foprget questioning anyone. Nolte's character lights a cigaret, gets mad, and beats interviewees to a pulp. His methods get him nowhere, until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut.|1
"If a movie ca n't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes , it 's over as far as we are concerned, but the rest of the movie, is over for the next 15-20 minutes . I would agree with the comments of the writer of the ""I don 't care"" blogpost but he is right that it's hard to take the film over for one night, and for the other half of the movie, the first 10-12 hours of the movie . If I had the time and the money I could do it for as long as possible ."|0
"I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information : Score 6,7 , well ... a lot more info

I just stumbled across this book and started searching and found this great book called The Dark Angel: A Study in Terror. It has been published on the web. You can buy it online and have it released to your desktop and mobile phones. If you want to find more information, the book is great to buy. If you don't want to pay, you could also go to the book's homepage."|0
"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called: sleep."|1
"Treat Williams reached a degree of stardom with this movie, and really squandered it. Don't be led astray by his poor movie choices since. This movie really stands out. ""Hair"" is a musical that really deals with the attitude, and probably more so with the persona, of the famed peace movement of the 60's. There is a lot of spectacular music done in spectacular fashion. Unlike the music videos of the late 70's, 80's, and 90's, the video flashes coincide with the subject matter of the music."|1
Like a lot of films from the early sounds days, Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. The hammy acting of lead Richard Dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting. However, even giving benefits of the doubt, Cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Offically, the film is two hours and four minutes; it feels like four hours when you're watching it.|1
"The Hell 's Angels did come out the losers in this movie . Sonny stated to the director that NOBODY was interested in this movie. The fact that there is NOBODY interest is a bit strange since Sonny is a no-show in the movie, which is why he was chosen as the lead actor for the role. When the main event was over Sonny took it upon himself to shoot the film, and it was a beautiful scene that brought the audience back to the audience with tears and laughter. ""It is a great scene,"" he commented."|0
Childish storyline ripped off of a lame Hollywood movie , terrible acting , cheesy dialogue , and not quite ``well-received'' action movie. The movie is actually a sequel to the first film. Now, though, the first movie was a pretty decent movie that did well in most parts of my family's lives. It did not have bad acting and dialogue. The dialogue did not really get the job done well in the movie, and the dialogue was often overused for a number of things (such as the ending).|0
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway, and the training of the dancers. Finally, the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini.|1
I am a Talent Manager. I have been for 15 years now. I have discovered some wonderful talent. They have been in Movies, Commericals, Braodway and Television. In my opinion Eddie Monroe was cast wonderful. I love seeing the ability of real people. Not just a name. The Actors in this movie were very natural and believable. I was very entertained by this film. I love a movie with a few twists. I also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved. I still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money.|1
Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild , but I do agree that it's a good thing he doesn't have a clue about his role in the upcoming Marvel film. It could just be coincidence that Duces Wild was killed. I just thought that I would post a couple of my own thoughts. I think they were written in the last paragraph. He seems to have really gotten into the Marvel comics. I mean, this comic has a lot of interesting elements that make it pretty cool.|0
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film 's plot details than I could . What do you think? Well, let's take a look. The film has a very unique set of scenes and sequences that you would expect to feel like real-life adventures, with a lot of tension (as with a lot of things in this movie), but also a great amount of drama, in which you can really see that the audience gets a very good grasp of what the real-life adventures really look like and what the characters are actually doing and how they interact.|0
Wow ... I suspected this one to be bad ... But now I find myself just at a loss for an answer. I hope that it isn't just because I don't know anything about it ... But I can't figure out why. I don't think anyone else does and I'm so afraid that it will never work out ... So if it's just for some reason, let me know and I'll come back and see ... And then I'll know what I've got right ... So hopefully, I've found it. I don't really understand what you were thinking.|0
"I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining, and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable.Ben, a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I guess you could call ""assistant"" to Evie, a retired actress."|1
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself. The cover shows a view of legs & panties in a short skirt. The title is `Tart.' The synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from. Everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie. I expected a sort of crappy, direct-to-video version of `Heathers' targeted at the teenagers of today.Let me tell you what `Tart' was really about.|1
"This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. And believe me, I have seen a lot of movies. The unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad ""Alien lifeforms inhabit earth"" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an Archchristian ""Judgement day is at hand, seek Jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell"" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this."|1
"There's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee. The bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she got for $22 (closeup of tag). Later, Mary Astor finds the tag in the boss's bedroom (proof that bimbo slept with him). Still later, Mary Astor is about to have an affair with Ricardo Cortez, looks at the price tag of HER silk negligee ($14) and is reminded of how disgusted she was about the bimbo, as well as the fact that she's spent $8 less than the ""most obvious"" woman she's ever met."|1
In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock , it 's apparent that Big Al 's fear from the police dates back to 1967, when he and his associates were arrested for driving at high speed in England (and was arrested for his driving on motorway) before they could be charged and released. Big Al's fear was for a number of years, and a great deal of police and public attention was dedicated to this case. Big Al spent most of his time in the police station, and there is a long list of those who have spent years in prison.|0
"This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80 . The jokes in the show are so lame that I couldn’t help myself, but if you see the joke I’ll send you a link

If you like this show (or any of the others I have posted) you should like to read a bit about it here . So the story is as follows, the plot is pretty simple, but I think I’ve made it to the main story point. If you’ve read any of the comic books I reviewed, you’ve probably already figured out how to play it."|0
I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg's. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true.|1
I was waiting for this movie for a time. In the first day of the air in Turkey, I watched it. It was totally a disappointment for me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but the one in the screen was a fictional one. First of all, the main character of the movie Cengiz Han, the great conquer was portrayed like a soft, calm, even a loser one. You can not feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered ¾ (even more) of the world know in those years.|1
"Until I did a Web search on ""What Alice Found"", I didn't realize that the name of the film is embedded in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's complete title is ""Through the Looking-Glass (And What Alice Found There)"".The Alice of the film comes from a background quite different from that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Her fresh and assertive character, however, is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her ass-patting boss and takes off for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins."|1
This film is so 1980 's and that is what I like so much about it . It does an awesome job and you can do it without really being any good . I like that when you make the movie you will know how I like it and I'll probably do anything to make it that is good. I like that it makes my body feel good to me. It's a very enjoyable movie and if you look at the film you will notice the amount of energy you get when you just do that movie . It does a great job of that and makes me feel good.|0
Two years after 'Airplane ! ' took off , Jim Abrahams , Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its last seasons. The comedy duo is now back with a second season and it's looking like they just may have reached the top of the heap this season. As is often the case when a show's first season ends the first week of an season, a new comedy drama is set in a new location. In this second season of 'Airplane !,' Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker are making some serious money.|0
my girlfriend , as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square , after the movie , says , “ You have a beautiful girlfriend ” . I remember the day when I was 10 years young , in a white house together , in a white house together ” , and when I were 12 years young , we had dinner together and then we were walking home together and we were in the kitchen , we were on the sofa in the dining room and when we were talking I told him “ you can hear us , you” .|0
"Wow , Stella Shorts are great ! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella , the TV show . I also have been thinking of creating a brand in the area . I want to do this before I start the show . Thanks for your kind suggestion :D

Hello, Stella Shorts ,I am wondering if you have a brand for them , I have a couple of them on the board . I have never been in a competition with them I think it is good to see how good they are , but if they are the same , then maybe I should go back and ask them for the brand ?"|0
Rabbit Fever is one of those film oddities. It's an enjoyable 90 minutes, demands little of the viewer, and delivers as much, and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot I think that Rabbit Fever would be rather well received. Which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas.The movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary, and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product.|1
"""Out to Sea"" is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This film is not quite as funny as their ""Grumpy Old Men"" comedies (which it strongly resembles), but there are many laughs throughout. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who take a cruise together. Once they get on the boat, the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau has signed them on as dance hosts so they don't have to pay for the cruise. This infuriates Lemmon who's in no mood to dance."|1
Everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'The Prey'. Endless nature footage, bad acting - Aside from these elements, this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases, is considered a cult classic.Jackson Bostwick and Jackie Coogan play pretty well off each other. There's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off Bostwick's skill behind the instrument. Not too bad if I do say so myself.The last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace. The ending still haunts me to this day.|1
28 years before 9/11 , there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile , and that date was 9/11/2001 , which represented the year of the 9/11, not 9/12/2002 or 9/14/2003 years before 11/7/2001 or 12/7/2003 years after 11/8/2003 years after 11/9/2003. In 2006 the date was changed to 9/12/2002, and the year 10/10/01 , it became known as the end of the 11/10/01 year. At that point it became known as the end of the 9/12/01 year. The date 10/12/01 is still used to represent the day of the first anniversary of 11/11.|0
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film ? ? Its not because of money spent on a film like it is , or because of the quality of its presentation. I would have to say that the presentation of a movie is just as much a function of the way the film was filmed as its presentation. I think there is a good deal of confusion about the term 'budget' in the media. The word 'budget' is used to describe something the public has seen before (or at least experienced before, I think).|0
I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed . It's very well-known. So I'm looking forward to hearing from anyone who does have something like that happen to you. We'd like to thank you for your interest . I think you and the director have a great chance of doing that, too. Now, I have a few more questions about this project. In some of the questions that we'll ask you about how to proceed, there are several aspects of the film that you should know about.|0
"I think my summary says it all . This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a lot more to say but it's one of my favourite videos. I hope that you'll forgive me for trying to put the title ""Candidate"" into quotes, but this video is really great. What's the most important element in this video? How does the music look? What does it do? The song sounds like it sounds like an audio track, the song seems to be one of the songs in the video. What's the easiest to put on your playlist?"|0
Well I 'm not the world 's biggest Sondheim fan , so although I have the cast album and I've played them in a couple of different places, I'm not saying that I'm the best. But as far as the band's sound, it is a good thing that I had the opportunity to play with this group for over 10 months now. It's a very fun environment to play with, as it puts the music live in the background. There is nothing more satisfying than listening to a band like this.|0
Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called `` Half Empty . '' I usually go out of my mind with the idea that if you don't have any money, I might get lucky. If you think about it, you will probably end up with a much better collection. I had no idea that you could do this for half a day. And if you have any sense at all, you know that this is a really bad idea. So we have a lot of fun and I'm not sure I'd want you to think that it's because I don't like that idea.|0
The good things first : I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene in which a girl throws a bottle at her lover. If I was his father I'd probably laugh. But Raymond is much better suited for a boyfriend. I think he would rather have a wife, too, because the whole scene has a very masculine vibe - and it's a nice little scene. If anyone knows more about me than I do, the following links are a bit vague but I thought I would share them.|0
I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger 's return to action after the dismal movies he 'd made after ``Dancing on the Scenic Walk'' when a TV camera caught his face. It was in the process of filming the film, and then it was time to take a few photos to give him a little glimpse into his world. He'd come to see it because it's the biggest television show in Hollywood, so to be able to make it look so much like the first TV show he'd ever seen was ''Dancing on the Scenic Walk.''|0
This is a fantastic film . The acting is some of the best I 've seen . Tatyana Samojlova is amazing . It is an amazing film and we have some good ideas. The production is excellent . I have watched the first three of the film but I could not give you a better look . It is a fantastic film . I will be watching all of it and hopefully someone will come up and tell me what he thinks . I will be surprised to see it but I think I will see it in a week . I love this film .|0
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched .... well maybe it is. But I think that people need to look at it more closely. If I were them I’d think that there would be more to this story, I don’t know how to put it but the main point of the story is that there’s no “in” anymore, this is the way things should be, where the story started, where it ended and how things turned out for the best.|0
"When I bought 4 DVDs for £5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie should have been better than all of the pictures I could find. It's only when I found it that I got the most out of it. 1/3

Whew, that was a pretty good look! 5/8

Not sure what I'm talking about, can you tell me anything more, as I'm sure it doesn't mean the same? 1/18

I just got this for £5.oo, and I've ordered it and got it ready. I think you could also get it for less, though."|0
"I must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3. What's wrong with it? Let's start with the gratuitous sex although I admit the rotational style of bonking was something I had not seen (nor experienced) before. And I guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The ""Oakville Tribune"" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be. (Hamilton Ontario???)"|1
"""The Man From Utah"" opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback. This is how we're introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), heading into town and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) foil a bank robbery with his fancy shooting, the marshal offers him an undercover job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are a tight knit band of bad boys in the employ of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also happens to head up the rodeo committee."|1
I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon. I've seen only 4 films so far, and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12, and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon's films, so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might).|1
This movie made me so angry!! Here I am thinking that here's a new horror movie, one w/a sense of intelligence & then the movie starts. The scenery, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the fake gore, must I go on? There are porno movies out with better dialog than this. I understand the concept behind indie movies, but my goodness, this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w/a camcorder & the cast are all friends & relatives. This is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning.|1
"This movie was included in the Six Wives of Henry VIII BBC miniseries DVD. I loved those six movies. They were well-acted, well-scripted, and historically accurate. I did actually read Gregory's book and liked it well enough despite it's HUGE historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole fake homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie didn't even mention that. That angle was one of the pivotal points of the book. Above all this movie just leaves me asking ""WHY?"" Why do we see, as someone else aptly put, ""The Real World: Tudor England""?"|1
This is a joke , right ? This ca n't be a real film ? It 's not even a joke . But it's real . You know, I've been talking to the film makers here about it before I 'm thinking about it for awhile . I thought I'd just like to say hi . I know this is a joke but I 've got a question . It 's really funny if you have a big question . Please don't make a joke . You're a film maker! You should know that I 've got to be one of the actors to answer .|0
"when i watched this crap , it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE , Which is about an old woman in a car wreck. I can't remember the words , but a couple of us in this thread are saying, ""we were saying this because it was interesting,"" and they were telling you it was interesting, too. What's the worst part of it all, the joke, when you've got no interest in the actual thing you're going to make about the title of your favorite movie?"|0
"This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small town and a love letter. First off, the scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this film and doesn't want to move to this location is crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is stunning as the lead actress who captivates the emotional roller-coaster role. Tom Everett Scott is charming as the ""author"" of the note throughout the film, and the always delightful Ellen Degeneres is hilarious! Blythe Danner and the actress who plays the bookstore saleswoman are both terrific, too."|1
One of the better movies to come out of the 1980 's , this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a man who meets a beautiful lady at the beach while she takes a bath at her own house. While the woman is naked she has a beautiful body and enjoys a drink while she can. The woman then comes out of her room naked and takes one of her fingers, causing her to lose her fingers. The movie has a great cast who played a couple of characters who are very beautiful and a lot of fun to watch at once.|0
I happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made Christian film about The End Times (which I find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I missed the part about UFOs and the Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense.As a film, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing was poor.|1
This movie was painfully awful. Most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods, walking thru the woods, or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two kids who discover two 'horribly mutilated bodies' in the woods, return to the woods the very next night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no time continuity. its day, its night, its day, its really really night, its dusk, its pitch black, its day. All the woods scenes go on like this until you think you will lose your mind.|1
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was a bit bad because when they announced that they are going to start making movies in the early part of 2017, i had to actually see the first movie i was thinking of making. So i thought that would make me think of a few different ways that they might work together, so i was thinking about the first and the second movie. Now, i haven't finished my first film so maybe i should think of something like this.|0
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow . I got the first part with the Spanish lyrics and they were very good , that's why I can't get the other parts. Thanks for the link, I saw your link a few years ago and I still like your music. I'll be going back on the track again. I love the Spanish lyrics, and I think they are excellent. It's very fun to listen to these words and they are so well written. In some ways they are great. I think there's a reason they exist in this genre.|0
"A notorious big budget flop when released . This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally hilarious twist on the past, so don’t hold your breath for a moment, but if you are ready to take a stab at it, you can do one or two of these things at once. Here are the rules:

* The following are not officially required but will become legal as soon as they are released . This is a rule not used in the film. It is not a new rule, but is only currently in the development process."|0
This film was a huge surprise to me while i watched it at Cinequest in the big California Theatre in the mid-nineties. You don’t know why you would be watching it. That’s what it was. It was, to me then, a completely different show than the one that i was most likely watching this time around. It wasn’t, as you would expect, a “show” to be different than it was in my mind, because it wasn’t exactly a “show” of the kind I’d hoped to see it in.|0
Firstly, I am a huge fan of crap films. B grade is always good for a laugh. Unfortunately this film is just plain bad. I dressed up as a Zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film. Especially the big guy at the beginning, it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons.The acting is so bad I need not comment on why. The effect are also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot.|1
A suprisingly good film considering the circumstances of its production. Features performances from no-name actors that rival the top talent on the planet (sadly none have persued a career). Also features the the god-like ability of Christopher Nolan to write perfect dialogue. Dialogue is what carries this story, which is about a man who likes to follow people for material for his books. Well shot, VERY well edited, even better written, and amazingly well performed.This movie has everything a great film needs, except people who have seen it.|1
David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable , or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks . They may appear anywhere in the movie but are not the main character(s) on screen. I am not sure if I should tell anyone but I do not want to get into all the details. It is just a movie and a review, but if you are looking for an overview of the movie, its not necessary. In some cases it could be good as you have seen in the movies.|0
Being a former MST3k watcher , even I found this movie unwatchable . The awful attempts at humor-heck the awful humor and the terrible jokes . This is a great movie and one that is not to forget . This is the sequel of a film I made recently . There is a reason this film is so well known : It’s all about how it’s about a person trying to be funny . We can’t say the same about the MST3k movies. But there are several examples where they’re not, or have been, humorous.|0
"It is difficult to compete against classic greatness, but once you make that choice and the decision is in play, you need find the best and brightest resources to keep your product top drawer, and on the cutting edge of quality. If your intention is to aim for second or third (or fourth) best, why even try? It is with that, I wonder why this version of the Ten Commandments was written, produced, and aired. I would ask the producers, ""What were you thinking? Were you endeavoring to create a projected deficit?"""|1
Created by Dennis Spooner, 'Department S' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol, based in Geneva, created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no-one aboard, if a man was found wandering around London in a space-suit, if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton, if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters, you called on 'Department S' to sort things out.Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King', a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases.|1
this film was probably the best `` scary film '' i 've seen in years . chilling might be a better choice . i see what i can do, i am sure you would like to see it again. ... ... there are some other scary films to be looked at in the future, and you can find them in this book. ... If you have an idea for a book or book review of a film, please tell me if you don't know it well. You can always find more videos here. You can always see more about this movie.|0
Now , I love bad , old skifee movies as much as most people . And I understand that a bad skifee movie is a big disappointment , and a bad movie isn't as bad as most people know. And the fact that they made it before was enough. So when I hear a movie like this, I always think about how many years of my life I spent watching movies, and how many movies I watched during that period of time . I think about how much I knew and how much I had to learn to master .|0
If there 's anything worse than this movie I do n't want to see it . I remember so many times I 've looked at the movie, but never once, because that was not the same movie I remember. But I 've seen it twice. . . . What 's in the movie, you ask, is that you want to do this with a movie, and you want to get your own version of it. . . I do . . . but it 's not the way I am doing it. . . .|0
I enjoyed the Mr. Magoo cartoons I saw while growing up . And I enjoy Leslie Nielson 's comic skills . But a lot of his work has never made it to the drawing board but it is very interesting to learn more about his techniques and to think about them more. He also has a comic book series . It is an amazing read and one I am not going to spoil too. He has made a lot of very good comics but I am just going to keep this for myself . You will be able to enjoy his art very much .|0
"I expected a lot more out of this film. The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it out. Bottom line is that ""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole"" only had one decent thing: Adrian Grenier.I really like Grenier and found his performance to be very pleasing. The character is designed well, but everything else sort of just drifts along through the duration of the movie. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think that his character was explained too well. I mean there's not too much to explain; he wants to become a woman."|1
I do n't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad . It Was Great, But I don't understand why I'd want to hear more than just that. I've seen the movies too many times and I love all of them and I've seen most of them more than I have. My first thought was: It was bad. It was awful, and it made me crazy. When I saw the first trailer for this, I was all for that. But it wasn't just horrible, it was a great movie.|0
"If you can stomach the campiness , this movie should make you laugh out loud several times . It did in fact help a lot to find the plot . 1. It's very good , it's a funny, but in the middle of this movie, you think that it really is funny . 2. A very funny , it really is very funny . 3. And then there are two other parts . And the first part is called ""P.O."" , and that's really funny , because it is the main character of the movie ."|0
George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great . I 've heard him speak to his father, but I 'd say he was his father. He 'll tell me a lot more . . . What's interesting is that you get a sense of where the guy came from in the world, you know. He's just like an accountant who's doing a deal on a daily basis and never gets anything done. I think that 's not a coincidence. I have no idea if he was a banker.|0
"Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the ""film noir"" section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) ""dupey"" looking copies of hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it."|1
This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of its time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, casually steals the airman pin from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrific. It defines his character beautifully -- a guy who's so low, he'll purloin something of inestimable value to a war veteran, to use as a prop in his various charades.|1
WAIT until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. Anything above 8 would be odd.Nice to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the New Yorker accent but other times her southern (Virginia & NC) accent did sneak through.|1
The St. Francisville Experiment claims `` this ai n't no walk in the woods '' , a direct slap in the face of the scientific study of what is now the world's second largest tree, which claims to be over 20 feet tall and 5.2 feet wide of trunk.'' In its latest study, the study by the Forest Service, the study of the st. Francisville experiment showed that while the human brain is almost entirely devoted to making predictions about the tree's future, it is able to make them about as well.|0
"I love this movie. At first, I didn't expect much of this movie since I didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres. I also didn't think David and Minnie would make a good on-screen couple. (I've expected a lot out of on-screen couples since I saw ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Personally, I think Joely Richardson should've played Minnie's part and vice versa."|1
First of all , even IMDb is slacking with this movie , as the list of cast is VERY ``old'' . So if you had to take the time to get it up , the movie would look pretty bad but I would think it would still be a really good IMDb movie . Well , i think i'm going to have to take this movie by itself , and see what it is like here . So after reading the reviews , i have to think that there will be some changes , so im just going to try and make as much of the stuff as possible .|0
"""You can survive anything"". Anything except a dumb horror flick. The director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer. You can't have both. It's like Michael Moore trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his particular charlatan brand of ""docu-comedies"": they're supposed to be oh-so hilarious and zany, and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, hard-hitting documentaries. Some genres cannot be mixed."|1
"A few yrs ago , I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell saying that a woman was a ""fraud"" and that ""feminist feminism"" would be ""more feminist than"" a ""feminist feminism."" I read that book. It was on a trip to Canada (as opposed to the book that I was on in college). And it was based on the following:

• The woman in the book would have the right to choose not to have any choice but to get a divorce in order to become the husband of his own wife."|0
"Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches , each one of them focussing on a female personal device that was used for the production of some of the characters. Description
In this sketch-drawing I have sketched a woman's head at the center, and a female hand on the floor. She's not the face of a female human, although the two hands are slightly different. She's dressed in a full skirt of some kind, and a small gold bracelet on her breast. There's a small yellow star on her chin."|0
My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated, until the day your boat sinks that is.The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit.|1
I saw this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it . I heard an interesting story about this film and when the movie ended I was thrilled because I was looking for a character that could play a particular role and wanted to make sure I was allowed to make sure it was the best I could do in the world . I also wanted to try and figure out a better way of acting for my audience . so I wrote my first draft and it turned out great and I thought I would get it done in a shorter amount of time .|0
Back in August , '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies , big hits like `` Urban Cowboy '' and its sequels, but it was not all over the news. And it wasn't over the news. For the first few years, the idea of ''urban-craving'' didn't pan out. It was a bit more than a decade earlier, when ''urban-craving'' became a genre known as ''urban crime.'' It didn't work as a genre. It wasn't a crime. It wasn't even a crime.|0
Marked for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences, than it does with focusing on its characters. After his first two impressive efforts, Above the Law (1988) and Hard to Kill (1989), this third Steven Seagal picture makes the idea clear: anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool; the bad guys are just there to make him look good.Seagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick-'em-up antics of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme.In Marked for Death, Seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation.|1
"I had seen this movie when I was a boy ( Before WWII ) and was surprised that the local movie studio called me to the studio to see it. The first time I did it, we had already done it on my first day. I didn't know about this movie and didn't want to do it myself. My first day at school, when I went to class, I saw what happened. I thought, ""Wow"", I can do this. I had done it in my head for a few months prior."|0
I love this movie! It has everything! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing, directing and co-starring in this film. David Duchovny is just plain hot. and Minnie Driver is as cute as ever. combine all that talent with David Allen Grier, Carol O'Connor, Robert Loggia, Joley Richardson, and Jim Belushi you have a Oscar worthy movie! I'm surprised they didn't get one. if you haven't seen it, go rent the DVD, watch it once then put directors commentary on...Bonnie Hunt is Fabulous!|1
I've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre. Some movies have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about getting the best out of people, working together harmoniously, building a team and achieving goals, without ever preaching morality. The situations are crafted well and are consistent with the movie's opening premise. The tension builds nicely and the humor is clean and consistent throughout. The movie manages to pull me right in to root for the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through.|1
Well well, at last a view of this underrated flick. But you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. It's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's.|1
Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? This is one of those films. It was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. I caught it on TV last night and gave in to curiosity.In the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'Carry On...' vein but with 'adult' language.|1
I am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (Bella Martha/Mostly Martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. I miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. I don't think that the story itself is enough. Martha/Kate is more secluded, and Mario/Nick is not a clown. In most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here.|1
Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head , and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wookin, has the potential to open the gates to Korean cinema and to bring it into new heights. It is the first time we have ever heard the news that this film was made in the Korean language, the Korean language means that you have to have a language to make that statement. In recent years, however, Koreans have been much more comfortable using that word than you would like to think about using it.|0
"The Love Letter (1999): Starring Kate Capshaw, Tom Everett Scott, Tom Selleck, Ellen De Generes, Gloria Stuart, Blythe Danner, Jessica Capshaw, Alice Drummond, Bill Buell, Erik Jensen, Margaret Ann Brady, Walter Covell, Patrick Donnelly, Lucas Hall, Christian Harmony, Christopher Nee, Breanne Smith, Marilyn Rockafellow, Sasha Spielberg, Jack Black.....Director Peter Chan, Screenplay Maria Maggenti.Based on the novel ""The Love Letter"" by Cathleen Schine, Director Peter Chan's film version, released in 1999, was not a big box-office draw, not even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements."|1
As someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). Such is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there.Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon.|1
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a lot of its time and energy to keep the audience going. It’s funny enough for people to feel like this one is going for laughs, but what about the ending? You see, you have to be a fan of Laurel and Hardy and you’ve gotta love it. It’s like when you’re an adult, and you’re on Christmas Eve you don’t have to care what you think or want.|0
This is a film that has to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films, but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set, or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn't go in expecting Blade Runner; the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far, and it's a far more zany ride.Essentially the film is a science fiction set in future Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as is obvious) about a society where it's illegal to procreate.|1
Once again , I 've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I had never seen such comments before but I read this comment and decided I didn't want to give them a second thought. Now it's time for me to post a comment on the original review and if anyone wants to read the actual review, you can do it. Thanks! 1. I agree with the above that you should avoid this type of comment. You can still use it as a reference for making a decision.|0
The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments ( much less hundreds of 'votes ' ) speaks volumes about its power and importance. So while we should be grateful to every single person who commented on a particular episode, we're going to be grateful for any that did not comment. As I said earlier, this is not only about the cruddy series, but also about the number of commenters who commented. The first comment was in the form of 'I think you are a great person', while the second and third comments were in that same form.|0
"Put simply, this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the ways. 1. Absurd plotting. 2. Over-acting. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create viewer interest.This film can't even pass the ""Soap Opera for Dummies"" test. I'm sorry I have not read this award-winning novel, so I am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went."|1
"This film was really terrible.However , it 's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scenes and some of their most memorable scenes in the film.There is nothing particularly funny in it,but I would recommend checking it out.I could go on and on,but I will say it,it's quite a beautiful story, but I would never give it much thought, because there are things that are terrible that need to be told.I would recommend the film for women to watch and to enjoy. 5

4/4

It's not a big problem, but I want to go with it.I would recommend checking it out."|0
This movie is amazing . You will NEVER laugh harder . It 's a target . No , I think it is a target . But it is a target . I think it is a target . I do think you will get to the bottom of the story and what you were thinking was a target , and that is the target . The main characters are actually very cool (I don't know a single person like them ) and they don't try to fool anybody with it. They just try to make sense of the plot.|0
Like the other comments says, this might be surprise to those who haven't seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But have you already seen Delicatessen, there is nothing new it this film. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this film just arrive too late to be of any interest. I don't think it's a worse film than Delicatessen but it's a bore to see it now, like it probably would be to watch Delicatessen again. There is really no point to the film, nothing that really matter or stays with you.|1
Okay , anyone looking to see a great work of art should NOT watch this film . A sophisticated film which will bring you the very best of what we've got. You will need the skills and understanding of the filmmaker to film the movie, but I think you'll find that they are very good at getting you through the film. A: I think you can get a good understanding of these. I've read this movie a couple years ago and thought it was fascinating but it is probably still one of the most outstanding films to date.|0
Film critics of the world , I apologize . It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public, and it's been my experience, and I think that I can help with that too . Thanks and I hope you enjoyed the article . If you would like me to write more about your book , please check out the . Thanks for looking at it . You should too . You can follow my other articles on . I've never written anything like this, but it is very good. A few years ago i wrote a review about this book, so this is definitely worth it.|0
Just how bad ? Well , compared to this movie , Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane . There 's the main character , the main antagonist of this movie. He was the one who got killed and all the others . The main antagonist is the main antagonist in this movie (the protagonist , the main antagonist is in reality). He was killed and everyone was killed , he is the main antagonist. He's the main antagonist as the main antagonist of this movie . He is the main antagonist in the movie. The main antagonist is the main antagonist in the movie .|0
Okay it is terribly, and I mean terribly, easy to pick apart this film. C'mmon what do you expect with the title, synopsis, and actors in leads such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman, and, my personal favourite, Roger Ready. Yes, B star John Agar is here as a sheriff out to rid the Texan landscape of a robot-like ape from a NASA experiment gone awry. The movie has dreadful performances, dreadful scenery, dreadful special effects, and dreadful lighting.|1
Okay , I grew up on Who , but have n't loved a Doctor since Tom Baker . Christopher Eccleston was one of the first characters to go through this , but there are a ton of references to it, so it would have taken me about half a decade to get around to it , I don't think anyone in the library can remember . He has been one of my all time favorites for so long . I hope to do better next time I'm going to talk about him . I was wondering if I would be able to help out, as I would love to know more.|0
I went out of my way to get this film , and was fortunate to get it on VHS . I never thought I'd find it on CD-ROM, because it's very cheap . I've still got the DVD, and I was going to write this one but I wasn't. If you don't know the answer you'll probably come across the same thing again. I had a DVD with my friends who used to play with VHS and I was very lucky to get this one in the right price point.|0
I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up . I was greeted by a list of people from the IMDb. I am sorry to see that we did not have it yet. We were given a list of all the top 50 IMDb movies that we've watched so far, along with the list of all the IMDb movies we've seen. We were given an award based on our rating for this list, so there are not too many films that are out there now, but it is a great idea.|0
Grosse Pointe Blank was really quite a below average film . Its hit man theme is very dry and is usually set at zero and is a very long shot. The only exception to the film was a scene where we were shot by a guy who was out of control in the early part of a shot . I wanted to see what happened with his face and his face was turned into the frame and it was very close to what I wanted . We had to take the film with a shot and it was very difficult to do.|0
After seeing the Harry Potter movies, I've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet, we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma, being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving Rupert dead-end. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him for once in this movie.|1
River 's Edge is an excellent film and it 's a shame that it has n't made more of a splash here. And that 's just the way it goes. As you can tell this is the first I've heard of a British film. There are some great British films that were released in the early years of the British Film industry, such as The Black Stallions (1953). The film is a story of a boy who, while he is in prison, is forced to live the life of his prison guard and the world.|0
Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet ever done -- no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors that have played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is ferocious and still sympathetic -- I particularly like the two doofuses playing Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very feckless and yet sinister. Some might gripe about the need for a strong Ophelia -- she's not a strong person, that's the point, and Lalla Ward hits the proper nuances. Amazing. Simply Amazing -- every one of the more than two dozen times I've watched it.|1
"It carries the tone of voice that narrates the book into the jungle of Vietnam and into the wild-eyed look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz. (I don't say Marlon Brando because after watching the documentary, ""Hearts of Darkness,"" I am skeptical as to how much credit Brando is due for that quality). The tone of voice I'm talking about is brooding and dramatic without being overbearing: ""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one."|1
"Set in the Philipines , Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop take on the world's most powerful threat , the Joker, who can't stop killing humans. The movie was originally intended to be a feature length, but it was released on the first anniversary of the movie's original release in 1996. The film is rated PG, with a 2.0 rating and an average rating of 4.5. It was also released on Blu-ray in Japan for the first time. Reception 

As of the end of 2011, it holds two consecutive box-office highest ratings for the film."|0
A terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the Teddy in Berlin 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. The actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet: it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (e.g. Before Night Falls (2000) by Julian Schnabel).|1
"Very poor script and acting . I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with good script and acting skills. I'll have to say that I had a strong feeling that this is my best performance. A:

Here's a working script for this. You must have a clue that the script doesn't have anything to do with you. But if you read the script a few times you will understand the purpose of that. A good script can provide some direction for your story, but this is only one part of it."|0
I took my 14 year old to see this movie . We left after 15 or 20 minutes . It was a shame because the first thing he did was find a car . Then the driver asked me if I wanted the car . I said no thanks . I had to drive for 15 minutes . And when I came home to find him on the car waiting to get out of the car, I said yes , he was already in the car. I drove to the store . I bought the car and took the cash out of the car .|0
There are only a few movies which can be called ` must see ' and SHEPHERED is one of those. I have watched every one of them before and nothing has changed in that regard. I have seen a bunch of them before but nothing has made it any less interesting or satisfying than this movie. But SHEPHERED will definitely have an even better chance of making your friends, family and friends in the coming years than any of the others I have seen at all. I can't wait to see what all of you guys are up against in the next 30 minutes.|0
The reviewer in Variety said this was `` overwritten and overlong '' , and I kind of agree with it, but I didn't have the time. It's a lot to take in and take in; I just wanted to get rid of it before it's too late.'' I had done that myself, but it was much more than I could say for a lot of people. I had never considered it, and I really didn't like it, although I was not going to have much trouble with it until I decided how much time I would take to make up a new script.|0
Just a few words : it 's a good thing George A Romero is still among us cause if he doesn't return soon it's because of a few bad decisions he's made at the last minute and he's not happy about it now that the new movie is in the box-office. That means he could make another one of the new movies. Just a few words: that's pretty damn good. And I mean that is pretty damn good. It is probably going to be a while before we know what 'the new movie' is.|0
I always loved this film. The music,story and the action. I especially love the opening and closing of the film. The music stayed with me throughout the years. The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte' after all. Julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and the scenes are wonderful. The characters are appealing. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's singing to them. I wish she sang to me in Vietnam.|1

Like some other people wrote , I 'm a die-hard mario fan , and I loved this game . This game played very well . I played it with my girlfriend . My boyfriend played with my girlfriend a lot , so I 'm good at that . I also liked the way he made me think about how I should play. I enjoyed this game too .

"Fortunately , I have n't seen this film in a movie , big screen , just on a small screen , or on my phone , so I have to check for that on my phone . But it's a film , so I have to check on my phone

I haven't seen a movie about it in years . But I just love it, I've been doing this for a couple of years since its release . I love it
I love the film , because I love it , and I'm happy with how the film came together. I love the story ."|0
"I still count ""Police Squad!"" as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere, on BetaMax no less, I have all six episodes. I knew that a show this good wouldn't last and that I had to preserve it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers didn't know that ""Police Squad!"" was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like ""You take chances just getting up in the morning, driving to work, or sticking your face in a fan."|1
I could n't stop watching this movie , though it was far past my bedtime . Comparisons to Hitchcock are hard sometimes , but it was really quite good . Thank you for reading it . On the one hand it's very good. I just have to admit I loved the cinematography - it's all I can get out of all the movies I've watched on TV. I enjoyed it too, seeing the characters from the movies and having them in the background. On the other hand, the music is great, the soundtrack is beautiful (not too bad), and the cinematography itself is just good.|0
"When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it ""the greatest achievement in the history of the American cinema."" That was not wholly tongue in cheek. TW&TL remains Milius' best work, and it's sad that he has so little opportunity to work anymore. However, TW&TL remains a striking exposition of what once was known as The American Character, largely on the strength of Brian Keith's superb portrayal of Teddy R. (Obviously Milius--and Keith--admired TR tremendously to make two films about him, including ""The Rough Riders."")"|1
I love Ustinov's distinctive, literate narration. And the photography is quiet nice. We put the film on for our 3.5 year old who sort of wandered in and out of the room. So for our first viewing, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were quite charmed. When we re-watched, sitting down for family time,we were all mortified at the violence and life-threatening situations the poor otter got into. About halfway through the movie, there's a rack of dead, bloody furry animals. Lots of blood, not just a little.|1
Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s ( Casper Gutman , Signior Ferrari , Mr. Peters , Jerome Stull , etc. ), he would be the subject of an extensive literature. He was born in England in 1910. He received a BA from the Royal Society in 1957. After a year at Oxford, he obtained an M.A. from Yale University in 1959, and a Ph.D. in 1972. He wrote a textbook for the Royal Society in 1972. From 1963 to 1974 he worked at the Royal Institute for the Social Sciences in London.|0
I can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb. Of course, I've come to conclude that IMDb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this purpose an average is taken of most people, and unfortunately, most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. But I digress. The movie. I really don't want to waste my time writing about it.|1
Even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies , this one stinks . The usual gaggle of oversexed teens in their thirties in this movie is being played as the pornstars. It doesn't even have to look like a high school diploma to be sexy . If you want someone with a sexy body , you have to have sex with them. In reality, it is almost as if they don't belong in this class . The only way for the naked teens in this movie would be by having sex, but it is also impossible to have sex .|0
This is the worst movie that I have ever seen. At first i thought that it was going to be good because I'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. All it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. Next time the guys who made this go to Bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. Please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list.|1
Being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick 's Clockwork Orange there was of course `` no question about it '' not only has he done great work on everything he's done in the 20's, but he also created quite a few well-known films in the late 20's and early 20's. The story is a bit more about the two brothers and their families and their love of the game, which is about to change the face of hockey on TV. It is also more about the brothers' journey to the future and how to make that happen.|0
I was laying in bed , flicking through the channels ... and boy do I have channels ... 500 of them ... I'm trying to catch them and I have no channel for those, I just want to try to catch all of them ... they are there but I don't know which one they are. I am getting a call to see how the channels are ... they are in my head ... and there is one of them ... I don't even know it ... it's just that it is so difficult to catch them....|0
"The back of the DVD for this movie raves , `` Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films . The movie was released in the United States and has been re-released worldwide . The most famous feature film is that of Tarantino , who wrote a screenplay for the movie which made him the famous Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films ."" Consequently, Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films , and the film was released in the United States as the movie. I don't know how it was released. It wasn't released, was it?"|0
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama's brought upon us by Hollywood, this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Natalie Portman), this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share. They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities.|1
The TV show was slow moving and the 'offbeat ' characters were sometimes irritating . Only through the miracle of watching a character who made it to the next level can we get to the real story . A TV show that was just one of those rare shows can't be taken seriously. It was all a waste of time . The only way to go is to stay focused . I have read and liked a lot of things on the TV Show . I am not a fan , but I think it was the least of its problems .|0
"I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two and I thought, ""I don't care what you do."" So I just laughed and went to sleep and it was only when we got back to work that I fell in love. Wednesday, June 18, 2016

I've been reading some blogs that have been written by people who feel a little uncomfortable with it. I'm glad I've had this issue. I think it's a good place to start. Here's something I've been meaning to write about lately."|0
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who , as a child , specifically asked for something because it would be so great! The only issue with the short was that it would get lost in translation and was very hard to find! A few years ago I was working with a colleague who is now a professional translation artist , who wrote a book on a short that I liked, so we decided to bring it back to its original source. The book was called “Languages in the World” , in English and French.|0
Having seen only once and in the dawn hours , I ca n't seem to forget this haunting film . First I read it , and I saw it, and I am sure that it is pretty much what I have been trying to convey. After reading it , after reading a few reviews, I finally got the feeling that I have done a very bad one . I don't know how long I have in this review, but I think I have been trying to explain it, and in some ways , this has been good for me.|0
The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India. The use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish, as it signifies one who is sharp, fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. The movie never slacks for a moment, and keep you always with some exciting action. The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple.|1
I watched this movie which I really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel so much older. And I can't wait for him to see this film again. I don't believe this movie was made to be a good film. I do think the idea that this movie made is to make a film. But it's a big movie to make, but I think this is one of the best movies made and I hope that in the future, it will make movies. I hope that in the future, we'll have a film to show.|0

1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Ridiculously lame 3D movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks. Stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site, become hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, is going to live. We really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies. What a waste of a 3D viewer despite somewhat decent 3D effects.|1
Originally, the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. I dislike serials; they're typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, 'The Golden Lake,' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the Spiders--to steal gold from Incas. A silly love triangle ensues, with some Cowboys and Indians action. The sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me.One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang's later, far superior work.|1
"Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw Waterston in) and it is too bad copies aren't available. A similar situation exists for ""Glory Enough for All"", a British series from around the same time, about the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both of these on DVD. Is it really so difficult to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that is able to be played in the US? Another very enjoyable series, again from about the same time, was ""Danger UXB""."|1
"Well, the Sci-Fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out... and they seem to get worse every time. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Espositto come off as rank amateurs, you can imagine how abysmal the REST of the cast in this waste-of-your-time effort is. The only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature(which is glimpsed in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is). The dialogue...the plot...if this ""movie""(and I use the term loosely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to this."|1
This film is a nightmare ! The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same as waking up from a dream! For some reason it seems like you cannot get a phone call from your boss because the boss doesn’t want you to know. So what should we do now? How do we handle the situation? Here I’ll share what you should do first and how you should start doing it. What should you do to avoid being the boss at the end of the film?|0
There is a lot to like in this film , despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about what to do and what NOT to do at the last minute, a lot of it has been given to the audience . There's a lot to like, and I'm not a fan of any of that . But in fact, it has a lot to be excited about . As you might guess, it has been told by some good actors and writers who were there during the time it took to film this film but it has the potential to be a better film of some sort .|0
This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. I now have many friends who are guards at Dixon Correctional, and I myself worked for 3 yrs at the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store the old lady was at. However, this is still the dumbest movie ever made, destined to be introduced by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it hasn't been already. A bit of trivia, Illinois doesn't even have parole hearings, and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals.|1
Junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed one bit. He is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. This time he has a pal named Trixie and she is only slightly worse. Junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. Then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. I thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end.|1
This is a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical from the 40's. 'Cover Girl' made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide, all-American star. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker- it is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. Her singing is dubbed, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly.|1
This movie is a disaster within a disaster film . It is full of great action scenes , which are not only funny but also beautiful and entertaining. The film is very good at showing how much better they are at making movies. It’s good at providing the audience with a more complete understanding of what it can do, what it needs and where it needs it. It also shows that even with a small amount of time it can actually work well. Of course if you didn’t have any trouble watching it then you will have missed the most important part.|0
"First and foremost I'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie ""Embryo"" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses (animal as well as human) aged 12-16 weeks. The embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. Okay, in all honestly, I didn't know all this, but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of ""Embryo"" could have done."|1
I agree with the guy above , It is so funny I understand it all , but my friends just don't like it , I mean they only understand it when other people are around who have no opinion and don't know anything, and if they are stupid, then no one is stupid or stupid , and you are all right , I just don't agree with what you see , not because of you . Thanks again for the kind comments, i will be sending a link back to your site to share some ideas if you guys are interested in them .|0
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age ! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are going to a comedy festival to learn to play the guitar. If there is any sense that this was a serious and serious movie or a movie that could be played on stage , then I don't see it as a bad movie as it is and I think they could be played on stage on stage and it is an interesting idea to see how it could be. I also thought about it one more time and felt that the movie would help a person to be a better man.|0
What a crap that movie is. The script is simply non existent. The movie at times seems like a music video. But it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. Pathetic way of combining action and rap. One might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. Dialogues in this flick just killed me. The scene when Harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. Generally speaking, recent Seagals films are hardly watchable. What the hell happened to the guy?|1
I find it amazing, that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this movie, giving it such grades (mostly tens). OK, the movie was fine, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues, rather not comprehensive for non-Poles. Screenplay is primitive, the acting (except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - awful. It's too much ado about nothing - fortunately it's not included in the top 250. P.S.|1
"Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish ""epic"" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the Earth. Potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few stray laughs, but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense."|1
The appeal of this film has to be the artsy Euro style , because there 's absolutely no substance . You have the cinema in your heart and your brain and your mind . And this is what cinema is for, which means you have a whole way to go . You can 't help but notice how it 's about cinema, and how you 're looking at it . . . and you really don't know what you are getting into . . . and how it comes into the world . . . but there 's this very important thing , which you can 't help but notice .|0
"This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, ""well, it's a comedy show,"" so I'll laugh, I guess.I cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. She does not deserve anything but booing.Why can't America dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.She is not funny."|1
"This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film . The direction just works well, and the characters are just as good as the book. Sunday, 13 May 2011

Today's post is the last, because I haven't given up on my next book. For the past 3-4 years, I have read a lot of great books. The last two years have been pretty great. I bought a second book on this topic last week. So, I am not sure I'll be back this week."|0
"Nothing about this movie is any good. It's a formulaic predictable ""romantic comedy"" geared to make females force their significant others to watch. In other words, it's a predictable chic flick that is neither comedic or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. If you like watching the same thing over and over then this movie will fit just perfect. I was also forced to watch this with my g/f at the time and it's no surprise we are no longer together. I enjoy great movies that are wonderful to watch, while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors."|1
Chop Shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters ! I can not begin to describe how wonderful the performances are. I do not know if the production of the first half of this movie is that spectacular, but I can not help thinking that it is the best film I have ever seen. It is certainly one of my favorite to date. I have never seen anything more amazing, and I do not really know what to think, and this movie does not disappoint me. The first half was a really beautiful and moving film. The opening sequence in the first act was beautiful and exciting.|0
This is one of those movies that has everything in it . I do n't think I would get tired of watching it in the morning . and then I'd have to write a script or something. But I do. This is the first time I've played it in an anime. I've always thought anime movies were something that went by the wayside, and it seems like there are people who enjoy watching them on DVD. It's a big movie that is really good but I have been watching it a lot in the cinema lately.|0
"Okay, it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs, the names of the old time ""horror"" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt Repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. But why these soldiers are anti-Republicans? Because they have gone to the war, most of them should be Republicans, right? Why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? Why they ALL want to vote against the Republicans? Why this story has made of a movie?"|1
Do not see `` Mr . Magoo . '' It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, as it was one of the only movies in the history of all movie theaters I was ever seen, even if I did not see it. It is actually the one I have been working on for years. This is why I would say it does not have the movie quality that I would like. I know that Mr . Magoo is an awesome filmmaker. I have watched him more than once, and still can say that, but it does not seem to be his style of filmmaking.|0
This movie was astonishing how good it was ! The plot is extraordinary , and the acting spectacular . At least for me , I like the idea . This was the story of how I became the best actress for a long time ! She was very good at it , and was also the first actress of the world! I had a few moments of surprise when I found out about her acting ability, and I really enjoyed her performance. The movie was a lot stronger than before ! The story was amazing also. For the first few days of filming the movie ,I had to be in a hospital .|0
I have just caught this Movie on TCM, and can understand why George Murphy went into Politics if this was the best MGM could serve up to him. It is so slow-moving that the attempt to make it a real film-noir effort does not come off. It featured two of my favouriteplayers in Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell(the best actor in the Film), but what really hit me was that the leading lady Frances Gifford went through some 90 minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on her face--her fainting scene was comical.|1
"I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically . Anyone who calls this one on the internet probably has seen it once. And while we do have some examples, let me give you an example from the last film:

As the film takes a turn, there’s a new scene:

When I saw this scene one time, I knew I was seeing it on my phone because I saw a video of what’s been going on. But the director had just finished making this film."|0
Ah yet another Seagal movie.In no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.As bad as Submerged?No.But that is not saying much.Like perfume on a pig.Seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.He lands in Prison and is befriended by a Gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.Its good to see Seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.We actually get a USA Location in Las Vegas it seems. Then an eastern European territory as usual.|1
First of all, let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning.|1
Ordinarily, Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys' - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda . . . the A list cowboy stars. But in this B+ film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a trapper/ mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men.|1
This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-acted, dimly lit, depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy, indebted junkie. Talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea, and all the crying wears thin. Recommended if you like independent, slyly intellectual, slow-paced Merchant Ivory-type features. I suspected that the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimated, it didn't really have the emotional impact of 'Brokeback Mountain.'|1
Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is . I especially remember the scene where they talk like it is the only thing they know for sure (it's the only way they feel about it). They really get to see this in the first place. It is a movie that's been played so much in the theater every year, and I couldn't agree with that movie a little bit more. I do wish that the soundtrack was better. That soundtrack is so bad. They're playing a version of a film that's very much a sequel to the original.|0
"You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a couple months after its release. “I think it was a failure for the first time. It’s the most innovative piece of music in recent decades,” Barrice said. “As you know the music industry is a complex and diverse one that is increasingly changing.”

At the time BARRICADE was released, there were over 1,000 recording artists in its portfolio. There were about 15,000 new record companies. There were more than 40,000 people in the industry."|0
If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well-financed, well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie.|1
I've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie, But Just The Half. Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly's Friend's House. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious. They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow, Anyone Can Make It, No Matter How Small, No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer).Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets. Mel Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman.|1
"As I read the script on-line, I thought ""Capote"" needed a trim. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn ""Adorable One""; here, he is ""Mr. Shawn"".Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke? ), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the Clutters."|1
"As was mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former ""Wayne's World"" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there was any good scenic shots of Ireland then it would give it another reason to see it. But instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the Emerald-Isle that are often shown in Irish films."|1
Without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had. It is not a movie in a vacuum and it is an important one and it has been the case for a thousand years and has always existed for the sake of the film, and it will always remain in it's best position ever since its inception in the beginning. The thing is, that is the most beautiful and unique thing about this movie. It is the story and the reason the film is so important to its audience. That is the best thing.|0
Another first : this French movie is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer . Perhaps I 'm a bit biased. I have a long, long way to go, but that is my way of knowing what I see. But it doesn't hurt. It is my way of being. And if you are just trying to take your eyes off the face of a person you don't have to see to know when it's time to ask. Or at least, not if the person you don't really care about and you don't really care about is in a position to understand.|0
"I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: I was not impressed, not at all. I do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.On the discussion board, I found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. It says: ""'Deed Poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes."|1
"I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. I'm not sure what I really didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I dispise math. Maybe I'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved ""American Beauty"", but that was it."|1
I like dark humor and non-PC stuff , but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself to another level of self-healing. For example, when I was a kid, my parents taught us how to write a computer program. We wrote our own code on it, it was very easy and fast to write it. But in the early days, there were a lot of software programmers who took advantage of the fact that computers were programmed to be programmed. They wrote the most basic of software, and then they learned a little bit more about how to program those computers.|0
It's been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches Froides because it has gotten such great reviews in the papers.The thing is with this movie, is that it has no head or tail, but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters.When it started I already knew that it was gonna be a long sit down, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between the players.|1
Hitchcock 's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of , but also the 'look ' of Anthony Bourdain's writing – particularly the 'little book' he'd written in 1987. It was, as it turns out, a very long-winded piece, and if you weren't sure which one of the main characters was who he was – or what the other characters were – that would have to be a bit of a blur. At the time, as it turns out, it was all a bit confusing for him.|0
Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910 's , others do n't quite make it . The most popular ones were , and are the first ones to be made into animated movies. It's not quite the same for a few of them because they're still very difficult to make. It's not a bad idea to make them, because you can make them at home in your garage and you won't have any trouble making them . But then you'll have a few of the most difficult ones which you've never even heard of at home (or seen).|0
This is the second movie about 1985 , the other one was 'The Wedding Singer ' . Whilst the 'Wedding Singer', I had the privilege to attend the wedding a few times, it was quite a bit different. Though not all the guests were the same, I felt the same way that I do in this movie. I had to wait till after it finished. It would take some time in the beginning to work out the differences. This movie was my go-to movie for many years now. I loved it.|0
See Three Colors : Blue and Three Colors : White . They are both wonderful films and will give an interesting story. There are many types of films to choose from and each of the three styles will have its own unique appeal. You might like to consider two styles (Blue and Red) because they are both well-known to a lot of people. Blue is the most popular style due to the fact that it has a very wide range of roles. The roles in Blue and Red will usually be portrayed by the actors in roles that were made by the filmmakers but they do not appear in the films.|0
I've been writing hardboiled crime fiction for a number of years now. When a writer develops a story he always has a character/actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. This was a slick film highlighted by Vario's presence both on and off the screen (as his voice-over narration is also heard). I also especially liked the actress playing Benny's niece and Eddie's ex-wife, although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the double-crossing that goes with it.|1
Just saw this at the cinema . I have n't read the books . There is nothing new about this , it's an interesting story and it shows that people can read the books they like and they can read anything. This movie is a great example of that - it's very easy to have fun with it and is fun and exciting . I think they are doing quite a good job in these kinds of situations so it's nice that they have the chance of getting the right type of movie and are doing it in a fun and exciting way.|0
Would be promising if it were a student film. Never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. As a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. There's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely.|1
"Wow , I was really disappointed . I was n't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater , but . . . I was having the most fun . . . but . . . It was . . ."" He stopped. ""I . . . wasn't really . . . I just . . . didn't see . . . I mean I saw it . . . I really liked it . . . I actually wanted to watch it again . . . and . . . and it was pretty good . . . and it was pretty bad ."|0
"""The Dresser"" is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. The film is brimming with wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the ""energetic"" character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay, and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (Albert Finney) that he assists, the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in ""Bullitt"" is again on display, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence."|1
"Here 's a decidedly average Italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala The Most Dangerous Things You Will Ever Know

The most terrifying things we’ll ever see

So, you might say it’s more than just being able to do it. Sure we’ll find it easier to kill things, but only when we understand what we’re doing, when it’s happening, when people are around us, or when we have it to work for us to do, or as part of our daily lives and life experiences."|0
I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can't say that much about it. It still seems to be very hard to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night UHF channel television of the mid 1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it.|1
I do n't know which was worse , the viewer 's made dopes of , or the stars in this world, but for the most part, I feel that they can be very good to watch if you try and play. If you get too excited you might even have to watch it again :). 2. If you really want to watch this video, it's not too long to watch it, unless you're doing some other game you're going to like :). 3. What kind of person is you?|0
The initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what ? They may even play there. The idea is that the newbie should know where they can get some of the best players, but it might not be worth the time to do so. There are a couple of things to think about, and if any of these things are to be true then you need to ask yourself some questions about the current situation. Let me tell you a little story. One thing that is of concern is whether or not you believe your players are getting better and better with time.|0
Not really all that much to this movie...either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie, goes to bar, is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady, offer him a job, he goes back to their place, refuses, the police ask him to accept their ya go!!! What plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them.|1
Most of Chaplin 's most famous films are his full-length features . And , I assume most people have at least a minor interest in what Chaplin was doing here, since the title character was not in the film. Anyway, I am going to leave this to you guys to try and show you some of the highlights I've seen here in the last couple of reviews, and also to thank you for being so generous with what I have seen. And, I hope that I can keep this blog updated as I go through my review and see what it's really like.|0
This was the first Chan film made by Monogram. What a come down from Fox values and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after seeing the great Fox films. This is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as Chan calmly walks across the street. Chan is now working for the US Secret Service rather than the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays No. 3 Son Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter along, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown.|1
As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie (keeping it kid friendly) FX was low class, they should of spent the $1 on a coke. As is typical with these D movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead. Hope the money was worth it for Boxleitner, really really big step down from Babylon 5. Nice to see what happened to Buck Rogers but damn this was low even for him. ' It was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also.|1
An unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as the Countess Balakireff chasing everything in pants . At the start of the episode, the Countess, Kay Francis, shows up in her costume and looks to the back of her dress to discover that she has been spotted by an assassin. The scene ends with the Countess and her suit being dragged away and thrown into the water. At least, this is how it played out later, in the movie. In the end, it was all too obvious to the audience that the audience didn’t understand why she was there.|0
Deep Sea 3D is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand.From the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily engulfing us in the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre, a shark powers towards us, predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey. It is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes.Our ears on the other hand, are not given the same treatment. The film is narrated by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet.|1
I can't really criticize this film. It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, seeing it again years later, it held up fairly well. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has some good scenery. The acting is on a high level.|1
"Computer savvy John Light (as John Elias) goes from Stanford drop-out to successful young Dotcom-era tycoon. But, Mr. Light's sneering success could be short-lived, with partners like ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (as Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan used to bed down with Light's girlfriend, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don't have to end in college. After reading a naughty Internet sex session, Ms. Dodds shines Light on. He may lose is ""Digital Dreams"" Internet empire, too!"|1
It was 1983 and I was 13 . I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were on the couch in my room. I knew that I was going to be an adult. I had no idea what I was capable of. And I knew that I was not an adult yet, and that was the end of my story. It was very dark. My parents were not in bed at the time but they woke up the following morning to do so. I walked out of the living room and up to the ceiling, which was quite thick but was not dark at all.|0
Look, don't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON! I could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been OK to a F***ing Nightmare. I am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.I am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one, this one didn't even try. Please don't waste your precious time and money. I am sorry to be so harsh but come on!|1
This homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. The local police have bungled the case for a few years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house, because that's where he's hanging out, running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals. So FBI-chick gets kidnapped, which involves her father, the former lead investigator from the local police.|1
We've all got to start somewhere, it was in films like Escape In The Fog that somebody like Budd Boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. In fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on June 25, 1945.The war on Europe was over for almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn could control the events of history. So I'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a Nazi spy ring was helping out the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the Pacific or Asian theater.|1
Why is n't this movie on the bottom 100 ? Raptor is , without a doubt , the worst movie ever made. I don’t see why they would ever release a movie in such a big number of days, but when they make a big announcement about it, I see a lot of reasons why it should be on the bottom 100, but it shouldn’t always be the worst. Nope. The one that I like most is The Last Temptation, which is about to go on a massive run in its first week.|0
When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January ( 2005 ) I did n't like it at all but I really enjoyed it, I think it was one of the few movies I haven't seen in the US. Now I just want to know where I was and what was this movie going to be like. Also I loved it because it reminded me of what I looked for in movies, but also because the characters were so nice to play. The main part of the story was very short, I didn't know what they were really doing.|0
"There 's nothing much to the story . A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she can earn a few dollars a week. Meanwhile, the young woman runs away to a friend's parents' house and finds a strange man in a blue jumpsuit. But the man is the same one who got caught in the crossfire and is being investigated by the sheriff."" ""The man is dead,"" the coroner's investigator says, and ""no evidence is found for the man or his body"" but an old woman has been sent home to find the dead man."|0
How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, and it made me want to scream and scream again and again, is it okay to say it's a good thing I don't even know it's a good thing I don't know I'm not supposed to tell anyone. But it's good for the kids. If there's any hope of changing anything, I've got to get to work on this movie. I have to tell you this was the coolest thing I have ever seen in my lifetime.|0
There must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie . In fact , I think it was the wrong place to put it. We're talking about some background stuff, but nothing that should have been left out of the story. . . . The story takes place in the year 2000. I've never seen anything like it. I guess it started out at the end of the day. And I think there is an ending to all of this, but I don't know how the plot will end.|0
I left the theater, and I was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucked. The plot was horrid and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie. I was only 10 years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young, innocent age I did not laugh once at the movie. We (me and my friend) still laugh about how bad the movie was. We ended up going into the 'R' movie my parents were in.|1
This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.In fact , it 's so nerve-wracking , I have literally just finished watching it once again in a few hours now!It may be the most awe-struck movie I have ever seen , but every time that you go in to look at it you can see it in person, so I don't want you to miss your chance to actually enjoy it.This is the film that I would choose to film for the movie , and if you are one of those who don't watch the movies in person you might be able to watch this for a few days .|0
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. There's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be rather lonely. One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner, a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls.|1
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out . I recall the scariest scene was when the girls were being put together in a room. They were having sex and I was in awe. I thought it was very cute. So, I just sat there thinking. I am sure I was totally taken with that scene , but, I feel like it has made me really proud of my body . I just finished reading about this video and I found it because I had never seen the movie before.|0
This movie was outright painful for me to watch. I understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. But there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. First off, jump cuts. There are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. There are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. What I mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. Secondly, the dialog.|1
lovely . i just love the movie . i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor . and i like him so much that i decided to watch this movie because it looks great on the new movie which i think is a great movie . I think the whole movie should be considered as a must see movie for people to enjoy . there are all kinds of things in it and i would love to watch it and feel very happy with the movie because it will have a great experience and it could be really fun to watch it .|0
Chop Shop, the second feature from Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story not usually found in American cinema, the story of the of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on location in Queens, New York in the shadows of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neo-realism to the core. Featuring a cast of non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle Thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagetic.|1
This movie is about pathetic , spoiled , ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say , performed by losers who do not have the guts to put their feelings out there . I know you may think I've forgotten all of this . I just watched this and it made me very unhappy . I think you should be very, very careful . But if you want me to write this , you should write it in your own words . It is not my intention to tell anyone who doesn't like me a story , and I've said so many times .|0
( May contain spoilers ) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives . While it is most certainly beautiful for the characters and the plot, if you're a fan of it, then you know that if you do it right . It is so easy for a writer to think about a story without being a fan of the movie. And yet there's a lot of good, interesting, entertaining, well thought-out ideas that can be explored and improved upon in any other movie. If you are a writer, then that is a different matter.|0
Probably because this is Columbia's first film in color, the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger, sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasing. Randolph Scott is the sheriff, a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford, who is an outlaw that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon. There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it.|1
This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through . After the introduction of The Hunger Games I got the urge to watch it again but it is because of this time. I have to admit that I will never watch the movies again as I would like it but if it was up to me and not up to everyone, it would still be worth watching. So what is the film about and what are the main characters? Oh, and what were the main characters? The Hunger Games is not a very good movie though.|0
This movie is an example of small budget , ineffective star cast , weak storyline and poor entertainment . This is an extremely important movie , and this should never happen if you are a fan of the show , and you want a good one that looks good. But I can not say that because I have been watching a movie with a bad cast . This movie is not bad, but the cast and the story are bad . I can say that , when I watched this movie I was amazed that this movie looked good enough to watch it again.|0
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend. one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all, no surprise it's what crispin glover's character (layne) does. he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his, the killer's girlfriend. not because layne did not like this individual, rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do.|1
"I'm a next generation person...i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21'st century; the new ""Doctor who"" started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or BBC America; from season one we are introduce to a new player Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (misspelled last name sorry)."|1
"I 'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts , nor am I bothered by the cynical , self-righteous stance the US and UK have taken towards the Brexit process. I do believe it’s time for Theresa to resign

‘There's an end in sight

When the Prime Minister leaves, all will be well – there will be more of it. But it is worth remembering that the UK is currently in the same position as the EU. The Brexit deal is good, and the UK's position on the EU is very close to what the UK does in the UK at this time."|0
This movie is an abortive , stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movies. It's the perfect film to tell the stories of all of the bad movies that have come along with the good ones. As we've previously pointed out in the movie, the movie is a bad movie and the good ones are better than the movies that are bad. When I think of good movies that are good but bad, I can see why people are not happy when they think of good movies in general.|0
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
As the title suggests there is a philosophical , meritocratic thread running through this film : if a man has the will to live, there is no need to live, and if the will to live is the will to die, a man has an obligation to do what is best to save his fellow man. He does not have to do that. He has to do his own thing. That is what a man does in a film, as his will to survive and survive is something he has to do. If his will to live is the will to go to Heaven, then what is the problem?|0
I just realized why the colors and sets in `` Sakuran '' were so flashy and gaudy , and just how many of them were even the same color. If you have ever seen the Sakuran series, I highly recommend checking it out. You probably already have, or have already read, an excellent review of the series and it's very enjoyable. If you are not familiar with these, you can check out a few links on Sakuran's page on Youtube. It shows how many colors were used, and how the colors are applied to each color element.|0
`` The Dresser '' is perhaps the most refined of backstage films . The film is brimming with wit and skill , as if the audience could not help but get a sense that the director of the production was able to tell the story as it was unfolding. '' is also a film that the audience could have expected, but found it difficult to process properly. '' is obviously a fine-looking film but is not the kind of film that the audience, or actors, would expect when watching it. What are your suggestions ? What are your opinions on what the film was called ?|0
Watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of British screens. It showed a different side of Old Australia that we need to see more of. Good juxtaposition of old hand and young turk. Then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic. It was sadly missed. This show was a cold look at the old way of looking at Australia. Hard living and hard working. The young idealist clashing with the old practical head. Real Politicka fighting with the young upstarts of New Labour.|1
Eve is an eye opener , because of the great sceneries and the tech-no music in the backgrounds , we need to work hard to have the right background, but it is very important for the kids to have good sound. The sound of the eye is very important in the school , to know if its the right sound to be a good teacher . The eye has also to be very sensitive to sound and the noise of the eye . A good eye will work the right amount, and the eye itself is very sensitive to sound , and also to the noises.|0
I'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog. The film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship, however, the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration. This couple has one dimension: they fight, they tease, then they make love and fight some more. There brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship.|1
"Wow! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep the cinematic masochists happy. If the cheap-looking opening credits don't tell you you're in for quite a ride, then the diabolically tragic ""writing"" sure will.A diabetic kid gets tied on to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation onto the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people. Need I say more? This movie consists greatly of cheap effects that makes it look like it was edited with iMovie (note that spooky color inversion) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to show up on some late-night Cinemax special."|1
Trite and tiring , the one-liners almost made me cry . My 4 year old left the room and ended up in a nursing home with what looked like a gaggle of older children who were screaming at each other . My friends and I were at the hospital for a few days as they tried to convince the nurse to call us . I didn't sleep well as I was in a coma and I could barely lift my head or my eyes . . . But I woke up one day and started hearing a voice crying . I thought for a very long moment that I had not heard it before .|0
I left the theater , and I was only 10 years old . That 's how bad it sucked . It was horrible , and I 've had a long career to look forward to , and the one thing I 'll always like is the 's too. . . I was born and I went to church school . We lived in a small square . I 'd like to see a church , and I was never there . It 's nice that it's my home . It 's all right , and I just like the way it was . .|0
I'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park's Thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time. Sang-hyeon(Kang-ho Song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously. Instead of legitimately dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).|1
As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was unimpressed and bored with this film. The acting was OK but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least.What bothered me the most about this film was the Celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film. The directing and continuity was pretty bad too! **SPOILER** For example, after Phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured, he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio.|1
1 ) Bad acting.2 ) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet , it sure looked like home. 4) I’m a bit over the moon. It’s probably too late to take this into account. A couple years ago, I got the impression I’d be doing a full-length film. In fact, I’d like to do this film as it’s just such an emotional journey, which can only be explained in the same way. There’s a lot of emotional baggage, too, even though there is also some fun stuff going on.|0
Just in case the title did n't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review ? Yeah.I decided to rewatch it because its a little out of this world, but I'll try to be honest and admit that I had no interest in watching this movie, even if it was a little of a spoiler.The movie is great. It has great acting. It has great sound.It really has the best cast and direction.I really like the movie but I didn't like it in the least. I would recommend it to anyone if they have a chance to see it now.|0
The plot involves a new , hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin 's barbershop . . . it's all just a series, so you have to look at every single bar to see what's going on and if you have the time you can look around the other barbershops and find some great stories. They're great and they do a lot of entertaining, so it makes it so much fun to get lost, but at the end we have a great story from Calvin that we'll discuss next week. And it is a great story.|0
Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy, coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving mother a bit more freedom. Working at Helen's store are the manager, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village-gossip girl who has eyes for the handsome fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young college students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny (Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles across a romantic, tender love letter and she suspects that Johnny has written it for her.|1
"Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie. But this movie has changed nearly everything without any reason. Furthermore many changes have made the story illogical. A few examples: 1) in the movie ""Paul Renauld"" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot only gets a letter), telling him he is afraid to be killed. This is completely stupid because if Renaulds plan would have succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not have been Renauld. (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs Renauld identified the victim)."|1
Yes it is your typical direct to video action flick. And of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously. Snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does. Colloca proves that you don't need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal. The worst part is that it didn't cover my bad movie basics which are: 1  Cheap looking villains. 2  Perfectly timed one-liners. 3  Intense car chases with massive explosions. 4  The hero hooking up with the hot chick.|1
This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema. By seeing this film,we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy,such a strong and adequate use of sound-image montage,and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema was then not only one form of arts. It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said, that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years!|1
"Though it's a Christmas movie, ""Christmas in Connecticut"" could have been done any time of year, as it's the story of a soldier who spends what is to be an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In reality, the lady in question, portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck, has a popular magazine column about life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor are the many recipes she publishes hers. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby."|1
"I agree with msinabottle; this is a great movie. Here are some dialogue snippets:Raisuli (Sean Connery) to Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen): ""You see the man at the well, how he draws the water? When one bucket empties, the other fills. It is so with the world. At present, you are full of power. But you're spilling it, wastefully. And Islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket."" Raisuli: The English have paid very well in the past."|1
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone`s home movie . Drama schools must be full of idiots ! , there they are taking drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio . Hey I think I`ll send in the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE EVER SEEN or send in a tape of my honeymoon and call it THE GREATEST SEX EVER SEEN . Oh hold on I`m not married and I`ve never been on honeymoon !|1
I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad .. From the script to the music to the film. I am really sorry about that but I am sorry to have had that issue. I have been having a few problems and am sorry about the same problem with my movie. It was so hard for me to get a new movie but now I get used to it and enjoy it, so sorry to have had it. The only problem I have with my movie is that it sounds like it should be more of an art film.|0
In Everything Is Illuminated, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during WWII. In a sense, the woman that saved his entire family.This is a heart-felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a strange land so to speak. Jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the Ukraine (he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). But what he discovers is more, much more than he anticipated.|1
Set in Hungary in November 1956, this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprising.Once the airport is closed, the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria. As would be obvious, they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness, his internal struggle between right and wrong, his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings.|1
OK , I 've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through a dozen, or more, sequels, horror and suspense films over the last few years. I should add that this was a first for him, and he would have been better served by some of his peers. I 've yet to get to see a horror film released after the first, even if it is as good as I can imagine. What 's up with the film? Well, what does it feature in it?|0
Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90's flicks?I mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets. Med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost; Flatliners. Bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past, Very Bad Things? Groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies.|1
This is a movie that deserves another look -- if you have n't seen it for a while , or have no time for the movie , you need to watch a few episodes if you want to enjoy this movie . It is just not for everyone. There's a reason why I like to write stories . I like the idea of story telling, it is simple and fun , I know that I am very good at it , so I keep on writing it because of this . I do not want to spend my free time writing stories , but I also enjoy watching movies .|0
Mixed group of `` experts '' ( explorers , divers and scientists ) venture a mile underground and go another mile and a half at the edge of the sea. Each of them takes their turn at the water surface and makes his way into the deepest water depths. They walk around and make their way in and around each other, keeping their head down above the water and keeping their heart and soul level with them. All that is required to be alive and to survive are the basic skills needed by scientists in this new age of scientific medicine.|0
"I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap title work. It only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! The only enjoyment I got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background ""car sounds"" audio just disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). Production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times). Sandra Bullock plays essentially a bit part, completely unnecessary to the plot."|1

They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the 'gendercide' of men. The funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.OK, the plot. Some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. So then all the men are killed or something. So there are no more.Then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent.|1
'Don't Look In the Basement' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition. 'Don't' is his undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd, disjointed, claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on. It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty, just plain grubby, for Brownrigg's world is this mad, unwashed, scummy prison cell of rants, obsessions and all shades of mental illness.|1
"This movie was made only 48 years after the end of the Civil War -- most likely in anticipation of the first World War that would come this summer. It has been a favorite for decades, being released on DVD on both CD and DVD. It was not released until 1983, which is nearly the same time as the Civil War (although it was released as the second movie of a series). The movie is not exactly the same movie as the previous ones -- only the first movie was released, and the last, ""The Golden Dawn,"" also was released."|0
I'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. Whenever she was on the screen I couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. Take about stage presence! There seemed to be a lot of people with hearing problems in this movie also. There was a traffic warden writing out a parking ticket who somehow didn't notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who couldn't hear a huge bulldozer coming at him until it was 5 feet away.|1
This movie was very cute and totally little girl appropriate. My nieces have watched it non-stop since they've gotten it, and as a result I've seen it nearly 4 times all the way through. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good, and the ballet portrayals are excellent. Although the story line has a few holes, no little girl will pick up on them, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that one hardly even notices.|1
What an awful movie. Full of cliches, perplexing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. It is hard to believe the same guys that wrote The People vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this garbage. Man, this makes my list of Top 10 Worst Movies of All-Time. Didn't this guy, this director, if you can call him that, realize that the first Problem Child was bad enough? Let alone make a sequel for it!!?? Amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released!|1
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect . Unlike virtually any other film I can name, I like to take in the world at the beginning of each scene. It is, in fact, quite a different experience from any film I have ever heard. I would have loved more dialogue in this scene and it would have been great if that were to be the film I chose, but it is not. It is rather dull. I also like the dialogue, that the actors are the same as in this scene. But they have different ways of talking about something.|0
I agree with the guy above, It is so funny I understand it all, but my friends just don't get it. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there. When I met my girlfriends dad, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so I give this movie a 10 out 10.I have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to Japan next month.|1
I have always loved old movies but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the elements of one of the best films of recent years. I remember being at the theater when I heard about it and it was a bit disappointing, but it was a lot of fun in it, so I’ll continue to be a fan of the film. In addition to my favorites I also had a great look at the films that made up the Oscar winners list. I was not so lucky with the first and the last film.|0
Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. When it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) Halle Berry is no match for Antra Malli. While the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all.One of those movies which makes me wonder why IMDb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. Yet again, I think that movie does not even deserve a 0. It has to be something negative or minus infinity.OK what about the plot outline?|1
"The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. The storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:Katie - A beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn't everything. She realizes that she can ""feel"" and ""see the real world""."|1
Dante would of been mortified , if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS ! ! ! And yet . . . , he thought. Perhaps he had misheard . . . Or maybe that was what she said. Whatever it is, it seems that he would have been mortified , if he was . . . if . . . he could have told her the truth . . . Or at the very least, maybe he was more mortified when she told him that . . . that he was a coward . . .|0
A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek , quiet , but very large gardener who is at least a few hours old and with an hourglass of blood to kill. I can see that this is part of his job, that he uses it to kill other animals but he can't do this to humans. But he can try to trick us and we all get eaten. But the wolfman will still kill humans, right? Yes, but you have no idea what you're doing. And if you have any questions, please let me know.|0
This is the worst movie of all-time , no doubt , and Schindler 's List , did in fact have to go back to 1990 to see how that was supposed to work. So you'd be shocked how the movie works, it was just a movie that was supposed to do it better than it could, and the only reason to see this movie is that it was in the best film category in years , when I was a kid, but that was way too many years ago, and that was it .|0
"This is marvelous movie , about a soul of Ale . This is a journey to Ale 's heart . Ale lives to tell the story. Ale is called Ale by his fans , his friends , his relatives , family

Ale grew up very close with Ale, his family

Ale spent his childhood in New York City , he went to live in a studio ,

Do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of ANY sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour ? It is funny to me that this seems like a common misconception. I've seen many a great spoof spoof and some of the other ones, but for many years I can't seem to get anyone to understand what it's like to be a spoof. That doesn't mean that the film is funny but that it's stupid. You do understand that when you've seen it in the cinema it's funny to you but that you don't get to understand the comedy.|0
This movie was extremely disappointing , I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy ' but do n't be mislead , it had a much better ending and it did a good job for it. The other thing was the music, which was actually quite nice , the only thing that was not great . I'm not going to do much more 'marijuana comedy movies because they were good, but it was still pretty good. The other thing that I wanted to do more 'marijuana comedies' was to shoot a few shots of some of the music.|0
This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.I remember watching Mr Bean with my family back in 1990, when I was still a child. My family laughed so hard at every episode, and the contents of which still come up in our daily conversations twenty years later. The memorable scenes which are still in my head include Mr Bean attempting to get out of his car park, shooting out the lights, counting sheep, and him in the swimming pool. We bought all the Mr Bean videos on VHS, no mater how expensive they were.|1
I had to watch this movie for a film class , I suffered the whole time through . I am so glad to hear that you are enjoying it and not afraid to help others out and to share what you have discovered . As you know, you are not the only one who can help anyone that you are looking for. Many of us are also going to help you if you just want to learn more or if you are willing to help out others that you can be part of that can be done with your time .|0
"( This is a review of the later English release by Disney , featuring Alison Lohman , Patrick Stewart , Robert Rauschenberg   
And you might be familiar with the cover artwork of The Good Earth and The Wicked Witch. The cover art was an early version of ""The Wicked Witch and The Beast"", released in 1990 and was re-released in the same year. The original cover art was taken from the film (see above ) by Andy Warhol , while the cover artwork is from the second issue of the Harry Potter books series. This covers the book title and covers the opening page of the book."|0
"If you came here, it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it.I feel for you, I *really* do. And I profusely apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we do) that this film ever had to cross your eyes, if only for a moment. I hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases.I, like everyone else, rented this movie believing it to be some stupid B-movie ripoff of Blade. I thought, ""sure I could use a good laugh at a stupid movie."""|1
"Okay,I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet I see this!I thought,""I have no idea of what this movie was like,""so I went ahead and put it in.OH MY GOD!!!! !This film is so darn bad!I never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did,but I did laugh,because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous,not funny!!!"|1
"If you put Seinfeld aside , this is The Best Comedy ever , no doubt ! Just Great ! ``

DELIBERATED

There are so many ways to write this. You'll probably have to spend some time on it, but you'll see that it has a lot of good features that make this one a good read. You'll also get to read the first chapter of the story, you'll see that the writer has already done the work, and that's that. It's easy to get lost in the content, and the idea of this is that it's a great idea."|0
Actually, Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times...mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield, for example, is no where on par for CGI, but I would give it the same vote.Everyone knows the story...which wasn't that bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it is a KIDS movie...and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role.|1
Nothing will ever top KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a shrink ( ! ) , but KvC aiC's a great way to expand their horizons! A few months ago someone said: 'I like it. It's pretty cool, but not perfect.' And yet this person has said something like: 'What is not perfect about it is it doesn't make sense?' And I have no way of knowing! That being said: I have no idea what he means. A: You will be very proud of your name and all the things you have put into your own little world.|0
Umberto Lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash . Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her lover. In this trash, an abandoned car is left in the middle of the sidewalk where the vehicle can easily find it. The abandoned car is located in a neighborhood, which is mostly empty. The trash can is at a very low level. This is because the street is not well connected with the neighborhood, so that there are not much cars left. In fact, the street is very small and there is not much parking.|0
"Barbershop 2 : Back in Business was n't as good as it 's original but was just as funny . . . "" I can't believe that I haven't spent enough time with one of these bbershop operators in my 20's and 25's. . . . . . I can tell you, the only thing that really matters to me about this is that this is one of my favorites. I never really felt like I didn't need to work in a bbershop (not that there is much that could be written about it in terms of what it was like)."|0
As far as fake documentaries go ( fakumentaries anyone ? ) , this one is up there with the best, and most reliable, of all. If you really are looking to film some of what's going on out there and make a good documentary, chances are you'll want to find out all about it. I'm not sure I'd ever want to do a fake documentary, but when I do, I'll get to see. I know there are people who know more about this subject than I have. I know that I'd like to know more, but I don't have time.|0
Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best. I left wondering why i spent my money on this movie.|1
"I do n't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy , and maybe I will in the future . I was in the early 2000's and I was reading the books. I don't go to the movies either, though. That's one of the things that makes me very happy:

1) I think the movies were great (or so I'm told, since I was a movie geek) and that's why I love them. It was great that when you see a movie, it's in your interest."|0
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work. The opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look. All is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter.|1
"When Hollywood is trying to grasp what an `` intelligent person '' is like , they fail so miserably , that they don't even know it

In the '50s, movie-making was considered the most 'intelligent' of all, and it didn't matter where the movie was made, it was still the most intelligent of all

However, as the 1970s saw the rise of artificial intelligence , we've noticed that the vast majority of 'intelligence' is 'invented' , which can be thought of as either 'science' , or a 'philosophical' view

What's not to like about that, though?"|0
A group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while this might seem like it will take some time to get their feet wet and get the most attention, it’s important not to overstay your welcome. But for those looking to see what is happening on the internet and in real-life situations, you’ve come a long way. This article covers the film and where it currently stands. For a more detailed review, visit the film’s Facebook page.|0
"Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS ""event"". There's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, featuring bland by-the-book TV drama clichés. Bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies, so I'm not going to complain about that. Silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion. What kills this movie is it's 10 subplots... all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot."|1
Actor turned director Liev Schreiber ( The Sum of All Fears ) does an above average screen version of the movie “Sickin' With My Eyes” which was released to DVD on June 30, 2016. The screen version, titled “Sickin' with My Eyes ”, has been shot for over 10 years. It is the first video film made for a movie and the first screen version for an anime film. The film has not been shown in Japan and is currently unknown in the U.S. There are no confirmed release dates for it.|0
When I first saw this movie back in the middle of January (2005) I didn't like it. I thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star, Judith Light, acted were so unlike her. (Which of course is true) And then I watched bits of it the next day when it re-aired and I felt pretty much the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.|1
"Surprisingly good and quick-witted adventure that features Kelsey Grammer ( supposedly in his first lead role in a feature ) , who in this story plays a character that was in the past known to him by the nicknames ""I"" and ""M"". This is a very interesting and interesting story, since there is very little dialogue and the characters and characters of the series are very much the same way. The characters of the series are much more familiar with Kelsey's character. This series is a good example of what I am trying to write this story. This is very interesting."|0
"I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV , now that I’ve got a good look at it :D

The plot was the same, and the characters were just as bad as they could have been :D

This one was a shame but there is a nice little scene in it. There was a huge amount of time spent watching it, especially when you’re really starting to enjoy the action! One scene was about a young boy who is having problems getting a new job."|0
What can I say...not much to this one at all. Pretty dull and uninteresting.The actors performances are just OK. The only one that shines in any way is Simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help but feel his talent was wasted. No one else rose above mediocre.The story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning, but then just doesn't go anywhere.|1
For a moment , let 's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie , even if it is a good film, and watch a few years from now to get your head around the story. You know what happened ? I'm going to try to write this review for you. And if it doesn't make sense, let 's put the movie down, because we're going to have fun here. So let us start over. The first thing we're going to do is tell the story of 'R.G.H.'|0
Stunning blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young, not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill, telling her story to a TV reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the community's well-heeled horsey-set, she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband. That's James Brolin, trusting as a babe-in-arms. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article that appeared in Vanity Fair magazine. It must be true! Whatever, it's far more romance than mystery, and a very familiar tale. Leggy Species star Henstridge as a gold-digging hospice nurse?|1
"Story of a strange love and a fall desire. Poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch.A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonize Venice. Idon't know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director's world. It is, absolutely, a"" memento mori"". and a exploration of illusion. A old mirror of limits, signs and death's delicacy. A trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. ""Death"" is a Orfeu's trip copy in the immediate reality."|1
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs . It is definitely an awful example of a bad habit. And it is, unfortunately, a habit that is often overlooked or overlooked by many and a lot of people in the field. I have found that this is one of the ways to not get too carried away with having to carry on in such a bad habit. I find the fact that some of the best books on how to do this in the world are either good or bad. I will tell you one thing that you can do to help others in this way.|0
"I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question.....Who CAN'T cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens. Also, almost every cooking show on TV is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work (except for Sandra Lee), during their show. Oh and yep....they do full meals too.Love the comment by the guy who hated the ""EVOO"" comment."|1
"I rented a copy of this one from Netflix -- big mistake. The DVD version titled ""The One-Armed Swordsmen"" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. Some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the DVD is still a mess. Don't rent or buy it. Not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense."|1
A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast . Not only have the people lost their homes, their homes and their pets but the people are losing their children too. It is a time of heightened anxiety due to the fear that the future will not come to an end. They fear a world that is not yet set in stone and is no longer possible. To them this world has not changed but they feel the need to do things differently and have no alternative to what is now.|0
"This is a semi fictional memoir of an ""international man"" who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years.I was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war. I was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting. However, I was disappointed by this film. ""Chico"" seemed fragmentary, with the main character, Ricardo, staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes. As could be expected, no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame. The excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained."|1
This is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. It really does not qualify for movie status. It is VERY cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. It looked like a home video! I mean I believe a guy I know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. It is that bad. I noticed the name from whence this cameAsylumand I will NEVER rent anything with that name on it again!!!|1
"First and foremost I 'd like to state - for the record - that it 's incredibly dumb to call it what it 's, but that it's actually a good example of why there is always a need for it to work as it does, because as you point out, the best way is to call it what it's. And, yes, it is. What I've got to change though:

It seems to me that I should say that I do believe that it's actually a better way."|0
A small-town schoolteacher (Geena Davis) slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin! Soon, there are men after her and a small-time private detective (Samuel L. Jackson).This was action-packed, with some great special effects and really funny one-liners (especially from Jackson). Although the action may get a little silly at times, who cares? After all, aren't movies meant to be a good time?Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was an all-around good time.|1
"This is a romantic, albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites. It is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80's genre like ""Pretty in Pink"" or ""Some kind of Wonderful"".Nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl Julie. It is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end.True, most of the acting sucks but ...I have been in love with Nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since."|1
"Well, this is about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a ""master of commercial suspense"" or maybe a ""compulsive technician"" -- or was he really ""deep."" Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean, but it's legitimate to ask if, at his best, he could not have been all three things at once.In this one he seems to be about at his peak. Hardly anything in it is accidental. It abounds with doubt, ambiguity, and wit."|1
I will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.The simple plot is.. well.. simple. I got to the point where I didn't care if they destroy the building or not. If I had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, I swear I would hurl the DVD out the window. And there's also the protagonist. They try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert!|1
Ben Marshall, a teen ager from a religious background, is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura. She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household. In fact the family has taken a widower, to board with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor at the local church; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church.The job Ben applies is with an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house.|1
This movie was a disappointment . The story is essentially The Shining with a castle ( or a very cheap one ) , which would turn out to look very much like that of The Evil Dead . I was not that surprised . In fact , I felt that the movie was a bit weak . Not only the plot, but the characters are not very good at it , and the acting is bad . After the ending , The Shining finally ends and I had a very bad day . I think it is time we got a better look at the characters and the plot .|0
"I think I can safely say (without really giving anything away), that this movie had no robots in it. The guys in ""robot"" costumes didn't act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole ""plot"" isn't a robot either.The whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere, with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe the acting...This couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of ""Star Crystal""."|1
I was laying in bed, flicking through the channels... and boy do I have channels... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month... DVD has spolied me.Anyway, I'm flicking through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I take interest. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could this be? When I first saw the previews to this movie in the theater I remember making fun of it.|1
"If you've ever been to Ukraine, this movie is absolutely hilarious. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about air bags in cars and waitresses in total shock over meeting a vegetarian, this movie really captures bits and pieces of Ukraine that you would never know unless you went there. I spent most of the movie nodding my head and thinking, ""Yep. That's exactly right."" It's a lot of fun if you understand Russian too because the subtitles just don't always do it justice."|1
"I 'm not here to tell you `` Armored '' is Kubrickian , Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire . Nope . Referenced here : **********

If I recall correctly, ""A"" means ""All or Nothing."" If ""A"", please, stop me, but I can't remember what I meant. But I can't recall it. It seems like it could be, but I don't remember anything about it, except maybe some kind of reference. But I know that for sure. Maybe I should just stop."|0
This movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book. As written by Rafael Sabatini, this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the Caribbean, and it would have made a grand motion . Also, it would have been very simple to make. All the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screen writers took the title from Sabatini then threw the rest of the book away. Even the name of the main character was changed, and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel.|1
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham , AL , which was actually a really nice venue for such a good film . It's a very large venue but it's still very well run and good quality film. There's a lot of music going on all the way, but it's a fun venue with great music too. The venue has also been well run since I first saw it, and I think it's still the best venue for a film. I didn't want to have to go into it again but I'm glad I did it now .|0
"'Water ' ( 2005 ) , the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta 's elemental trilogy has been a hit in Indian film circles since its inception. ""Water ' is one of those movies which brings us to another time, a time when our ancestors, who passed on the Earth, had to go into this world."" The series was made on May 8, 2005 in Toronto and released on May 17th, 2005. It received mixed to positive reception from critics and audience members, with an average audience rating of 8/10."|0
Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor , but this is in a league of its own . One of the major differences between Western and non-Western remakes is that Western remakes are better adapted to their own culture, and Western movies have a lot of cultural baggage, but I’m not sure that American movies have gotten the most from them, or any of them, at the box office. Still, I don’t feel quite so sure that American remakes have gone down the drain in the box office, so it may not be the case for a western remake that is on the way.|0
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks , this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. There were a lot of problems. One thing you’ll notice is that no matter how nice you feel on the screen, there won’t ever be anyone to watch it with. That’s another thing that made me think that I would have to go back to work for this film. As a result of that, we have no other work to do – we’re all out here. We’re going to go to work for this movie in one day.|0
Rififi is a great film that is overlooked. It's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. It's an over used story but this one is different from the others. They round up the usual suspects for the job. This film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. The actual heist scene is one of the best I have ever seen. Instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. This fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days.|1
This is an excellent documentary about a story I had n't heard about before . The first solo , non-stop tour . The first couple of weeks , and then another. I have not heard a word about it at all before, I just hope I can have my say about it when it is available. As I read, I was excited. I watched the first couple of songs, and I was excited, and then I saw it again, and I was excited again. I was watching a show that had the same name as this, but it had a name from the second verse.|0
"I cannot believe I let myself rent that piece of garbage! The acting was so poor, my Grandmother could have done better. The punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the Scarecrow was knocking to the floor. The movie became a chore to watch! So this group of baseball jocks decide to go hazing, even after they weren't supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences. So, naturally, they go anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called ""Scarecrow."""|1
I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . . . I have no idea how or why. I think a lot about it and what it is supposed to teach or to do at all. But I think that if we are taught what it teaches it should be a very simple and simple statement and I think that if we are taught what it teaches we will be able to have no problem. I think that should be simple and simple and then we should be able to think.|0
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter. Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers, Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine. Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town.|1
This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario that I can imagine in which anyone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What WERE they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is MacLaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for American audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid.|1
Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever ... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe . The music from award winning jazz musicians like Paul Rodgers and Frank Sinatra was just as popular as Sam Marlowe's other tunes . Sam was the main attraction in his debut solo album . He was also a huge favorite for the group and was invited to the studio by the lead singer-guitarist of his choice . He also has a knack for developing a well rounded, dynamic and dynamic voice that is also very effective . Sam also had the ability to perform his solo song on the album .|0
I love pop culture , but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this . Then , I realized that I can be a little bit skeptical. And then a few days later, I saw the news. And my first thought was, “Is this fake? I am not going to buy into the fact that this is a fake . . .” I thought for a minute, and then my mind began spinning again. It seemed like an obvious fact that the fake news had happened . . . but it didn't make sense at this point.|0
"Writer & director Jay Andrews, a.k.a. Jim Wynorski, serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade-Z computer generated reptiles in ""Komodo Vs. Cobra,"" as generic a rip-off of ""Mysterious Island"" meets ""Jurassic Park"" as you can imagine. The chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects. The cobra and the Komodo are hilariously awful. However, the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable."|1
"The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home . it was an honor to come back in season one. The second season had some challenges but I think it's important to remember when you look at season two. I have a few questions about season three, and I want to answer them in detail:

Does the player have to play in a different position than he is playing in? If so, do you think the player has to get out of that position so that he can go back to playing the role he is playing?"|0
I was unsure what to expect from `` driving lessons '' - unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a vehicle, or whether Grint could not. It looks like there was no way for him to carry the vehicle, so he didn't really have much to work with anyway. But the driver did have his own ideas, so it's not clear what is going on, but we should assume that he'd been talking to the dealer, where Grint is, and there might be other cars that can help with that.|0
When I first saw this movie , I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset , so I had to watch it right away . It wasn't very funny but I think what I saw made me think, that there are so many things to learn in the movies , and it was hilarious. When I was watching it on my tv, I was having a lot of fun with it. There are also so many people that I would rather watch watching the movie than I would think that it is a horrible movie .|0
A chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room Italian castle while still grieving the loss of their young son. The couples marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of their son and left their daughter blind. Upon taking inventory of the castle for a future sale a hideous, tortured and misshapen creature breaks lose from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza .|1
"Excellent story , wonderful acting , amazing production values and a cool , action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end :)

I viewed my videotape last night , for the first time in at least ten years . I found the story of the murder of a child to be so chilling , like the first time . I have to admit, I have no idea where it came from . I can't imagine what went on behind my back . This is just part of a series of stories that will make you think again and re-think some more. I also had to stop by the house to see the scene. I noticed something . It was dark. It was almost like I was falling asleep.|0
Actually , Son of the Mask did make me laugh a few times ... mostly due to the cartoonish jokes ... but sometimes he made me look silly ... and it was even better because that was what he had been telling me before. But you know what ? I mean, I didn't think anyone else would ever say that - I thought it was just him and me talking in the middle of a conversation or two ... but he's a good man, so I guess you can believe that he did make me laugh every time I did.|0
"I think this is a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me. It is blatantly obvious once you look out for it: the main characters in this movie are the inspiration for the bullies on The Simpsons. Layne is Jimbo, John is Kearney, and Tony is Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons where Jimbo uses the line ""I poked her with a stick. ""The Jimbo-Layne connection is the most obvious with the knit hat and long hair and the voice. Kearney has the shaved head, unlike John, but is the big, dumb one."|1
"I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this ""movie"" left me stunned in my chair.It's so bad that it could just not have been any worse. Not once did I laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. I have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one I remember best - in my nightmares.The only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.This is the worst movie ever."|1
As a Genghis Khan `` fan '' I was looking forward to this movie . After devouring Conn Igguldens epic film, I could never imagine what I was going through in such a short time with so much story. I would not have it any other way, but I wanted to see it with my family and friends. And the movie was just a big hit, so I have to say the film has been on my very favorite list since it was released at the time. I would not say that this film was a bad movie by any means.|0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film. The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.|1
I really wanted to like this film , especially after all the buzz I 'd heard revolving around it . . . I saw it on video but it was a big movie so I wasn't quite sure what to make of it . . . but it was worth it . . . so I thought it would be a great story . . . which I'm sure many of you would have liked to hear . . . but if you enjoyed it you can find out the whole of it here. That's pretty much it!|0
Jess Franco makes exploitation films , and he has made tons of them . Franco is responsible for some of the biggest exploitation films out in the world . He is the only one who has ever done it himself . He started it himself and has the greatest of them . He is a big fan of the films he made with Franco . He made it out of a piece of shit he had , but he still does it himself . He's a big fan of the work he makes . He's a big fan of how people talk and what they think.|0
`` Delusion '' is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile . . . or something. This film is just so funny, it's hard not to feel the same . . . and it's funny. . . . And I think the best thing about it is that you can learn a lot, because you get to live and learn . . . but not be bored . . . you don't have to learn . . . and if you don't learn , then you don't really know what you're getting into.|0
Okay , so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern society. I don’t believe he wants to make Psycho the color of his own personal reality. He doesn’t want to paint himself into the light, but I do think it is a pretty good design. But if you look closely it seems as though this is some sort of dream or dream sequence for him as a teen, then you can see what he sees. He doesn’t even say anything, so how could I be any happier if I could make Psycho out of it?|0
"Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda. It came no wonder for me that this is admired by most American viewers and hated by Europeans. This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere. Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round. operator work is ground zero etc. etc.You have been warned. It doesn't even have ""guilty pleasure"" entertainment for those brainwashed iq=0 human beings.I wish I could enter negative values, admins?"|1
. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there.I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles.|1
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film , but with Today's review, I was in the mood for the next review so I decided to make a few comments about the film itself. This review will start off with an introduction. It will tell you what I love about today's review, but also what I don't love. So, why are you here? Because I like it, right? I don't think so. I think that the movie is good.|0
OK , so I know better than to watch movies on SciFi . . . er , sorry . . . . . . but you can still watch movies on sci-fi television. But it's not the way the internet is , right? And this is what I find so strange, though , because this is what I think sci-fi means. And you've had a lot more trouble watching it now than I have , so I can understand why you might not want to go there. Or else you wouldn't have known this about SciFi . . . but . .|0
I did n't expect much from this movie , it was just one of those movies I thought I 'd love to do. I'm sure some of you are hoping it's not like this because of the fact that you might get it wrong if you were to give it a second thought. But for you, it was just a great movie, and it did a lot for you and your career. If you're interested in learning more about film, please visit this website or the website of the film company, and I hope you'll have a great weekend!|0
Until today, I thought there only three people, including me, who considered Heaven's Gate (1980)to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western, (since the 1970), after, Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). I was stunned and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB rate this movie a 10, as do I. A recent book, the Worst Movies of All Time, includes Heaven's Gate.|1
If I could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating I would . I was stupid enough to go into every single thing I had to get to know that I had. So what do you guys recommend in the film that you really want to get into? That's the point where I get a lot of great advice about how to make it into the film. I just don't see it that way. No, it's not a very good movie. It's not even a movie for a film. It's not a movie for anyone and everyone.|0
"If you just want gore, and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want a at least a sliver of good acting, logic, story, consistencies, or even a good guy ending, go elsewhere.I couldn't help but to think to myself, ""Jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?"" Example, after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated, the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck."|1
"""What Alice Found"" is the greatest movie that nobody's ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard of it, and I though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say all indie movies suck, but this one, and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" didn't suck. I asked my friend, who'd seen it before I did, and she said that Alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that I remember, and little nudity."|1
"Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino, ala ""Ocean's 11"", and pin it on the Hell's Angels. Bad move. For a film with the words Hell's Angels AND the number 69 AND featuring actual Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly tame. The Hell's Angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them. Not this snoorefest. Luckily this is one of the DVDs that features commentary by Joe Bob Briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly alleviated."|1
"Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly ! ! I related to the character Ann August more than most other things, but I think the first part is what we have come to appreciate it :D

Not sure that is what I wanted to get back to though. I'm not going to lie, I would like to find out what has been on my radar for the week. I'll do my best with what I can get, so let's go back to the past and add a few things to my life!"|0
This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s C&W singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. The count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, creepy former nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and went mad! Fallon is trapped but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave.|1
The producers of this picture are Hungarians . It 's not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are in the picture. . . it's by a great writer that you and I are at the bottom of the list. I've said this before and I'll say it again. We don't speak about it now, not after this. But, you know. I'm really sorry if I didn't mean it but I just wanted to say it a little. I didn't have the courage to say it.|0
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given Uwe Boll's track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce.The first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness - even the horrible one-liners delivered by GI Joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre.You will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point. You've already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history.Next, enter absolute rubbish talent.|1
"THE OTHER is a supposed ""horror"" movie made during the 1970s. It is not to be confused with the similarly titled THE OTHERS, which starred Nicole Kidman.The plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as ""the game"". One of these twin boys - Niles - is supposed to be ""good"". The other one - Holland - is supposed to be evil.The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel."|1
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional . Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the theatre but it was the beginning of my career . I was very excited to learn that I made it for the first time and also to be very pleased to learn a bit about the theatre . I love cinema and I was delighted to learn that the theatre is my most favourite cinema in England . I was also delighted to discover how I could film for the first time in a theatre . I was amazed when I discovered that there was nothing that I could do better .|0
"Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says ""stay away from this movie"". We should all pay more attention to that little voice. This may be the worst movie I've ever had the non-pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your DVD player has a fast-forward button. Made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, ""The Cavern"" is obviously a quick cheapie made to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like ""The Cave"" and ""The Descent""."|1
`` The Planet '' is an astounding piece of film making . For a mere £8000 Stirton Production have turned the story about a scientist's quest to see what lies ahead of us in the world and how it is going to affect our world. If we want to make a film that really looks at the world and tells the story of our lives, we must make sure to create a soundtrack of that world that will give the characters the feeling of living together in the moment and in the world we want to see us live in.|0
Just a great soundtrack . Really enjoyable music . Outstanding cast , great lead performance . Worth watching.Does n't really have alot to recommend . I feel very fortunate to have heard this song . If it is not already mentioned , I would definitely be recommending this one to anyone who is looking for one or a remix . If anyone can give a review on this, please email me so we can talk about it . Thank you very much in advance for taking the time to watch this song . This song is a great album , I've listened to this song 3-5 times and have never been so impressed.|0
"Okay, enough. Every time I think I've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that I think that no one could possibly find something to praise, I just come to the IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual inane ""Undiscovered masterpiece"" ""GREAT film"" - I mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess I just watched on the new Fox/MGM/UA DVD. There are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning."|1
The film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then ends with a dialogue that the audience is introduced to to help them understand and appreciate the film's story. I'm not a film buff. I'm just a storyteller from a different generation. I'm not even sure what is happening in this world. The most important lesson is to not get caught up with the story and don't try to tell a good story with it. I can tell you there's nothing you won't get caught up with.|0
"I started to watch this show by accident, but I love it. The fact that main character is in a wheelchair is something that lacking in television, especially for kids shows. My five-year-old nephew (as most children do) would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched Pelswick it just seemed to be a normal occurrence to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair he would simply say ""Like Pelswick"" and go on with what ever he was originally doing."|1
Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40 's and 50 's , you were guaranteed great success. I'd give it to you, but it doesn't matter if its great or not. I don't care if you got it, or if you didn't. But you don't care to be able to say that you liked it. I wouldn't put that into anything, but you did. And if you don't like that movie, you might like some. But I'll tell you what I think: it's a movie you can enjoy.|0
"Oh, my. Oh, this is a *really* bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is god-awful, and the photography is simply dreadful.What does make this movie stand out, however, is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. ""Oh, s/he died? Huh... Figured they would"" was the best reaction I could muster after each murder. Characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off, you could still figure out who was who."|1
Check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in. We get a pretty good look at super-secret Los Alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end WWII. Except for the tight security, it looks unthreatening enough. Note how it's a TV repairman, an obvious regular guy, who takes us through security. Once through, it's like any-town-USA, nice homes, quiet streets, kids going to school, and a family TV on the blink. Later on we see little Tommy and little Peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates.|1
A kooky, but funny bit of diversion. You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. It's fun to watch. Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even more low budget. For someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died.|1
"I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America engages in. I cringe now thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s we all knew ""stoners."" These were the kids who wore Iron Maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two."|1
A young couple decides to runaway to sunny California. They never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the Rest Stop.After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop. When she is ready to leave, she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of Texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company.Rest Stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic you may ask?|1
How in the world does a thing like this get into my DVD player at home ? How does it play out as well? If you want a more detailed analysis of how movies come into the world, you can read my blog, my review and my review section. More info and more information. But if you want to learn the most in the world at this time, then this article is worth a look. In this article, I will take a look at what makes movie DVDs great. Let's take a look at some of the movie movies that I like.|0
Dear Readers , 2001 : A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best ... although I really ca n't say what he did with that, but let me try and find out why . . . In the summer of 2000, as I was watching The Shining, a new documentary film that I had previously watched called The Shining and I was impressed by it. It was a great documentary about a little girl who's parents told her to leave. When I left the theater I got a phone call from a friend that I couldn't pass up, but they said that the girl was having problems with her mother.|0
"This was not a good movie!! Why do you people keep saying that? There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires!!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where did they come from? Also, what the hell?! There are all of these ""super human"" vampires but George Clooney and three other random guys dominate ALL of them. Quickly too. It's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies!"|1
...and I Bought A Vampire Motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together. Some 'bad' films are quite enjoyable (like Norman J.Warren's Inseminoid), some 'bad' films are just bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but 'bad' films that try and do the post-modernist thing of being knowingly bad should always be approached with extreme caution. A lot of people think Troma's Terror Firmer is a bad-taste masterpiece, for example, but I'm guessing anyone over the age of nineteen will shrug it off as worthless dreck.|1
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique , brilliant , and very twisted at a minimum . Well, it doesn’t seem as if it is, but I hope it can turn out as it is. The idea behind the Park Chan-wook can be summarized as follows. If you are going for ‘speciality’, you don’t see it. Why does the Park Chan-wook seem to be unique? There is a few reasons. It is the product of two people, that they both own, and you would like to work on them independently.|0
Brilliant Aussie movie ... A little slow at the beginning , but once it gets going you ca n't stop until it got going and it's all right. I really liked this movie though. I am very happy that the soundtrack is all right. I don't know a thing about music but it has always been great, that's how I like the music. It is also a very good piece of the musical. It really helps me out in the end as to how it has affected me and it really helps the story of me. Thanks for that.|0
I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations , having just graduated college and moved on to work as a web designer / developer for the web. In the new pilot episode I’ll introduce you all the details in what we know so far. First, our main question: Can you please tell us more about your web hosting plan and what you’ll be charging? Second, we’ll try to explain what it is you are looking for, how it’s really going and whether you’d like to buy the hosting.|0
"when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing ( especially when they were making a movie like it is in real life) and the next thing i saw was someone was walking right towards me. That’s what my friend said,

The only time i saw this movie was at a concert where the music was really very popular and it had really strong themes. It was not the end of the world, or a dream that was fulfilled but it’s a lot of fun to be on tour."|0
I awarded this presentation 4 stars. They are all for the script, which has been butchered beyond recognition in places. What can possibly be said? They took one of the finest plays written in the last century and methodically robbed it of its heart, humor and humanity. I don't really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with shoddy direction and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their insides -- and insights -- ripped out). I do very much blame the director, who seems to strain to find ways to undermine the script.|1
Eros and Thanatos , Love and Death command the dialectics of Life . By the end of 19th century in Germany the dialectics of life and the way of death played a pivotal role in German politics. German writers were in a similar position to German poets: they, in their writing, understood the essence of the language, and their literary language was the dialectical language. The same happened with German poets who, when the language was broken, became writers. German poets did not understand what it was they were doing; their work did not have a certain meaning.|0
There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas Island,” and this is one of those things that will have to be revisited at some later date (or at least that’s what I thought at first). That is, if you know the meaning of the phrase, and I know the meaning of it, you can use it here. I’ve chosen to use it in case someone else gets confused, so I don’t need to add the word “fearful,” but I’d like to do that.|0
"I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was all about ""Dinosaurs eat people."" However, it was disappointing even on that level.For starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly ""enough"" dinosaurs."|1
Our family ( and the entire sold out sneak preview audience ) enjoyed `` The Guardian '' . Kevin Costner, Bill Maher, Mark Levin, Michael Dern, and more was part of the show! '' , the show is still on hold, but the cast will be back to back shows the next week or so. So if you have any questions about what might happen with this show in the next week or so, do feel free to send them over, and I look forward to seeing them all again on April 19th for more updates.|0
As much as 'The Beginning ' showed that we 're still going to get `` classic '' x-files , Drive-a-tachts, and that it's still getting a little tired, and it's starting to get too hot, we think that we'd be better off to just keep our eyes on the sidelines. So what's in store, then? I'll just give you some hints. First, you don't actually need to 'have' a backup for your drives, but you do need to be sure you don't already have one.|0
This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I am giving this movie way too much credit! My best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone else's martial arts abilities, but realized that you can't just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it, so he put a story behind the fighting... and people still didn't watch it.This movie's story line was onion skin thin.|1
The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman 's `` Autumn Sonata '' ( 1978 ) starring Ingrid Brecht. The film was a massive success in Sweden and Finland, making a whopping 1.2 million views. In Sweden, it was one of the worst films released. The Finnish studio made the movie twice. In Finland, the Swedish version was only the second time since the 1950s to be produced. In the USA, the film was also the first Swedish movie ever directed by the Swedish director Yrjänäkönen, who was also an expert in English language cinema in the early 80s and early 70s.|0
i did not expect to enjoy this . in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew her too. I would say to you there is no reason you can not find such a story and a couple of stories you should never have told. So what is the best way to know the story? I would ask the reader to make a note of what you told. If they think it was a bad story, then you shouldn’t read it, as I know there is some bad stuff out there.|0
`` Mishima : A Life in Four Chapters '' is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative narrative. We've been able to work through each chapter and make some of these characters as vivid as we could on our own, so I think it's a lot more difficult to do that than just getting the book out of the way while you're reading this series. But if you're not into that sort of stuff, you should probably get a copy. For the next five chapters of this novel, you will be able to read the story on your own.|0
"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II."|1
I have always loved The Muppets. Though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable, The Muppet's was. The Muppet's are very, very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters ever. Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas carol to The Muppet's treasure Island. The first Muppet's movie, The Muppet movie, was also, like the show and the other films, excellent.The Muppet movie is about how they all got started.|1
Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie ? I have recently been reading a blog on the latest news site and am curious if anyone finds the news articles entertaining, informative, and a little scary. To answer your question, yes. These are the news articles that are featured in the blogs. These articles do not have any specific content. I have just started a new job and I'm working with a very talented young woman to help me find some of the interesting facts about how the internet works in general.|0
"There are no saving graces in this dreadful, stagey, boring snooze-fest, which brings to mind ""The Ransom Of Red Chief""! Even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. Glenn Ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. Donna Reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. The son is such a repulsive little brat, I found myself rooting for the kidnappers. The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler."|1
"A low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore. However, it is not an excuse for poor writing. It is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical. The dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training.I also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. With that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, ""that was perfect""."|1
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado , played to perfection with expert timing and panache , don't worry! I was very pleased with the quality of it and how well it came out, as I was absolutely thrilled with what it was. The track was perfect, and I really enjoyed playing it with Mikado! I wish I could have played more of his stuff but it was impossible and he was too slow for me . The track was a good piece of art, and it looks great, and it should be on everyone's album as well.|0
"Without doubt, GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of ""AAA"" level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun, ""G"" rated family adventure. This is a MUST BUY for every video collection! Director BARRY TUBB skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo / 4H competition for the ""GRAND CHAMPION"" cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges. Joey Lauren Adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well-intentioned mother, but the star of the show is 12-year-old EMMA ROBERTS, whose on-camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt, JULIA."|1
"(This has been edited for space)Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie, the central character is a vampire, the film actually has elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body), romance and few other things as well. It's a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case Emile Zola's ""Thérèse Raquin""."|1
This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film Total Reality , which was the first film I heard about, and I’m glad I was there. And I’m glad to hear you think you’re a part of it as well. So here’s my take. This is what I thought I wanted to be able to say about Total Reality. I wasn’t sure how to say that. I don’t know if I had the patience to really get there, but I was able to do it.|0
Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clichéd cop-on-a-mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action. Tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer (no not Buffy!) to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave. 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible film. It rips off so many other films (can you say Blade?) that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity. The script is non existent.|1
I have to hold my hand up and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. Where do I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction of course was the soundtrack. Which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what Himesh does best. But as they say, don't give up your day job - HR definitely shouldn't.HR's acting is plain and simply awful. Even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there.|1
The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, the acting is awful, the female leading actress is chubby, and the story is... wait a minute... There is no story...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you expect to to see Piranhas, you might be disappointed. This movie has nothing to do with the Piranha movies from 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of one scene involving Piranhas.The only thing that I liked about this movie, besides the fact that it runs for only about 85 minutes, is the song at the end.|1
"Found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown,(Mark Hardin), played a military adviser in South America and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. However, Mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. In one scene as Mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed),""Dead Sexy"",01."|1
All right, let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. The computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. That's the first thing that's wrong with RL, everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people. I mean, shouldn't you, as the leader, be telling people how to handle each and every mission?|1
If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated.|1
Well, this film came on on a workday at 230am. The cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes I was held captive to my television till the very end. It has you on the edge of your seat, then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.The only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film, causing certain sequences to drag just a little. Nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.|1
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films, I thought it looked very entertaining. Before watching the movie i went on to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched to movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable. The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time.|1
Yeah , I know my title sucks . I could n't think of any other title . x ] Ice, it would be fun if someone gave me a new one for free ! Thanks for the reply, I had to wait until this thread was about to be deleted to try to read the title again. I want to find out if there's a chance that I'm missing something on this board. I don't understand where you came up with the idea for a title. You said something along the line that someone might not be interested in.|0
Probably because this is Columbia 's first film in color , the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. I do not know who you are in this scene... I would just like to understand why you would think the movie should not be about the color. What is it about a color movie? I just watched the film. But I was very impressed by the color film. I can't remember how many movies have it in the world. I've never heard of it... I was a fan in my childhood.|0
"I 'm sorry , perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911 , perhaps it is too much to hope for ? Or perhaps I can try to find this article on the internet and give a link to it for you to see if I can find a good resource to read about it? Thank you. A:

"Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I've ever seen. It's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place. Some scenes are not ""nice"" or ""beautiful"", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. This is exactly what's happening here. The camera is used to intrude, to disgrace and to ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan. The music is disturbing. Just as I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this one is the worst."|1

First of all I hate those moronic rappers, who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like cliché'e version of gangsters.The movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse There is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both hill billies and Sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters.|1
In his feature film debut `Yellow,' Chris Chan Lee attempts to enlighten Hollywood's portrayal of Asian-Americans by departing from the stereotypes typically depicted in mainstream film. However, in so doing, Lee commits a far more heinous crime: he exaggerates Asian-Americans' own stereotypes of themselves to the point of incredulity. The result? Dreadfully one-dimensional characters and an outrageously shallow script triggers the cast into a frenzy of over-acting, ultimately resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch.Don't be deceived by any of the positive reviews garnered by `Yellow'; each falls into one of two camps.|1
"Without doubt , GRAND CHAMPION has the most impressive cast of `` AAA '' level stars and musicians ever gathered in Hollywood or anything else '' (The Hollywood Reporter)

(CNN) At the start of this year, the Grand Champion of Hollywood will be looking to add a new title to his big screen franchise, ""Super Mario Bros.""

Yes , it 's a SBIF ( So Bad It 's Funny ) classic . With a budget running into $2.5B, it costs just under $500/month if you get it. That doesn't include everything you'll ever need to start your life away from a house that might be worth $500/month. While your life is going great it doesn't take a lot of time to turn your house away and start your job. You have to make time to make time for yourself. But you need to make time to make the right decisions with the right people .|0
Imagine every stereotypical , overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930-1940; it may be hard to know exactly what they did, so what happened? And why? Because the answer could be no. What happened at the film theaters during the 1950s-60s? That’s right. We’ve been watching it since the 1970s and I have to admit that we’ve heard about it several times. But I’d like to think that this was the earliest film theater experience.|0
I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; I was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot.|1
I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didn't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video, but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced, and wasn't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.There were other problems.|1
I hope this isn't a portent of things to come. High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I wouldn't swear that's what was used here), so it's open season for all the wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos.There is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker, and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice. The photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. What's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst.|1
"I have for years remembered a song ""JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE"" (""No. twenty moonbeam square, just a couple in castle in the air""). I couldn't find the song, but I remembered that it it had to do with cartoon bugs. I located a reference to the movie on the web. I had seen the movie when I was only 9 year old at the Ligonier PA theatre. I was pleased to find that it had Kenny Gardner the singer with Guy Lombaro (I am a Lombardo fan)."|1
A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles . The special unit’s purpose is to help police get justice in the communities of which they are police officers. Its purpose is to provide justice for the people who commit these crimes. When you see that you have a special team of Special Unit Police officers, they’re not a couple of police officers, but a couple of law enforcement officers, that work together in a single organization to provide justice for the citizens.|0
This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available.The Good : 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about Theresa ChanThe Bad :The main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman Theresa Chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. No linkage between the 3 story lines. Minimum DIALOGUE in the film, substituted by SMSs and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.|1

The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny, the woman who believes in doing good, no matter to whom, with no strings attached. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.Of course, none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful play.|1
I went into this movie with an open mind . I had been too lazy to go to the video store and review it, so my review went into an online site and I went in. It was one of those things that made me a bit angry with the fact that it made me a little paranoid that this might be a book I would really like. As I started reading this review, it became apparent to me that, no matter how I read and reviewed it, I never would have been able to get it to make me feel safe in the movies.|0
"Yah. I know. It has the name ""Sinatra"" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented this thinking it was some movie I missed in the theaters. It's not. It's some garbage ""movie"" made by the folks at Showtime (cable station). Geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want! It's not good. I am as big a Sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb."|1
"eXistenZ was a good film, at the first I was wondering what is going on, organic ""pods"" made out of mutant reptiles which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a umbilical cord, well it seems a little odd.But once it gets going its a pretty good film, with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of weridness throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next.Security personnel throw away the metal detectors; they have bone guns !"|1
Finally! Other people who have actually seen this show! It is the funniest anime I have ever seen, but most people have even heard about it. It is just hilarious. 'And so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day, he will save the world....or maybe not'. tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city...because he has no choice since his brakes are broken (study study study)' And some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook, 'today i had a very educational experience.|1
One of the movies i just DIDN'T want to see. I got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.Also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it's filmed from a book of Giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.|1
the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie. the girls were lame and pathetic, i mean, how can they own their own clothing line, dolls, movies, producing studios, and not smell this bomb from far away? in order to gain some sort of responsibility, which i dont really see the sense in the punishment..., they are sent to paris, far far far away from home to live with the so-called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris. i cant really remember what he was, so who really cares?|1
Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent adult film. That's what the Christian film is all about, not just the fact that the film is not just religious, it is also the fact that it is not the type of film people want to see anyway, nor that it would be a good film for any religious person to watch anyway. If it's not the type of film people want to see anyway, then why would they care about that?|0
`` No one really knows how the Power came to be . Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its beginning in the late 15th century. In fact, many writers had already written a number of works in that time . They would probably do better to make a different point here . They have already begun to write for it . . . and to give the world a true sense of what it means to be a Christian . . . There is a strong sense of hope, of hope that there could be no more . . .|0
"Hello again, I have been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California in 1942. What a wonderful story of being good to one another, kindness, and charity. You forget it is the bugs relating to one another. It was just as if they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult children. Such beautiful color in this movie.I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie, that I just can't remember the ""why"" of it.Thanks for listening."|1
"The sun was not shining, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies, that cold, cold, wet date day. ""The Cat in the Hat"" was the name of the flick, and when it was over, my stomach was sick.Mike Myers played the Cat, his humor was lame, and kids needn't see this, the humor was not tame.the film was like drinking milk, from a rabid cow, so it IS fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers didn't know how.This film, in short is atrocious."|1
There's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel, which piles on the naff visuals to no effect. Good old Alan Smithee directed this one, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, by Bruce Ramsay) are terrorised by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick.|1
"Though it 's a Christmas movie , `` Christmas in Connecticut '' could have been done any time of year. And it was, but for this movie the holiday was a holiday in England, where it is in the movie industry. The first of the movies, '' Home,'' is set on the city of Newport, New

The second of the movie '' Christmas In New York '' could have been done anywhere in the world, with all the movies that were made for the city, with all the people, or with the movie companies."|0
"I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way), so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it really also ought to say ""Comedy"" in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value), it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging, which is very rare in current TV shows.I've seen the first eight episodes, and #6-8 were my favorites so far."|1
`` The Cave '' got released more or less simultaneously with the English film `` The Descent '' , directed by E.A.F. Johnson (directed by L.A. Smith and directed by L.E. Smith). The film had first appeared in 1966. It appeared on TV, radio and in the documentary `` The Man Who Wouldn't Die''. It is a major feature-length documentary that will feature the work of an American director and producer, and some of the most important characters from the film. It was produced for the British TV channel, and the movie was released on April 1, 1968.|0
Well , first off , the twins are exactly the same . there is no one is girly and one is a girly . so there are no difference . if we see that there is nothing . and if we know that the twins are as girly and girly , then we can get a better picture . but not a picture as girly as this , this is a very simple picture that can be made . and there are no other pictures that would make a good picture . if we know that there is nothing . and if we don't then we can go on to the other questions .|0
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen . On a par with Blair Witch 2, this should not have been such an issue for me because I have never seen a film about that sort of stuff, I know. But I did, and it's fine. The main thing here is that I didn’t do it in the movies because it wasn’t in a good way. And so it was nice to see it over and over again. But that’s not to say I can’t do a lot of work for the sake of work.|0
Mankind 's Self awakening is the theme of `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' , a process that unfolds in our lives as we read, listen to, and read books. The first book, `` The Big Short,'' is published in 2002 and in `` The Book'' in 2005. It features some of the most beloved and beloved authors in the world: Martin Selznick, Edna St. James, Alan Edelstein, Peter Beardsley, and many others. In addition to the many great authors in the book, there have been a number of other books that were released and published before 2001.|0
Ever since 1981 , Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda . Most ideas that came in to use Super Mario Bros and Metroid were created in 1980, with Super Mario Bros. as the first entry in that series. Nintendo’s first release was in 1987 and it was a very successful title. In 1987, Nintendo released 3DS and Super Mario Bros in 1987. The game was the first on the handheld system in the world. The game has been a classic for the most part for its time, but it has evolved into a major hit in modern times.|0
For the first time in reviewing films , I found myself immediately uninterested in this story . I do n't know whether I was a fool, or a hero. However I do know, and I do n't know if I was fooled by a hero. If you look back at a few of my posts I have noticed that it is often difficult to get caught with the stories that you read, but they do have an interesting premise. I know that there have been many books about movies, but this book has a lot more to do with movies.|0
The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired .. I have never seen the films of a movie, just the film in its entirety. Not to mention I’ve seen a couple of these films for the last few years which I thought were well worth it, but the only thing I did want to see was a few action scenes where the character would be trying to kill a soldier. So far, I think they’ve done an admirable job of capturing the moments when the actors would really want to kill a soldier.|0
Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter that started the trend, but as is the case with many of the genre's clichés - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the originators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of American pre-Halloween slashers that warrant a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly pre-date 1978, whilst The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies.|1
Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a big budget production that totally fails to deliver; not only is it not as clever as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring time waster. Do not be fooled by the media hype, and particularly the stories about people throwing up in cinema and being mentally scarred for the rest of their lifes because of the brain - eating scene: in the movie it just comes across as laughably bad SFX.|1
I saw this film many years ago , and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to be released again! What is the point of making films when it is so hard not to do it properly? The truth is that most people like doing the films as they should but there is no way that you can change it so it works as expected. If your plan is to get it done you will get the results. It is just as easy to make movies and make a film based on that plan to make the film.|0
I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love . In fact , it makes sex an all-American sport. But when it hits theaters, I can't blame it. That's one reason I wanted it. But the way the movie opens and plays, you don't know when it's going to be sex. And then it's all about you, and what you want sex with. So I thought if you wanted to watch the movie, you'd have a good time, and then you're going to enjoy it.|0
I realise it's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a Charleton Heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better.The one thing that threw me off was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-Pharoh like. The acting really wasn't that great. For a modern adaptation, I was expecting something better. It just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one.|1
"For the record, I hate spoof movies. Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE! because those are classics and make fun of the clichés, not the actual movies itself. I think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. I especially hate things created by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the ""geniuses"" behind DATE MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE, and MEET THE SPARTANS.I decided to give THE COMEBACKS a look. Since Friedberg and Seltzer had nothing to do with the production, I was as objective as possible. It was just like one of their movies."|1
"This film was n't good at all . I was able to catch it at a film festival and did one in Italy . I thought it was funny but I thought it made a good comedy . And then I got another one in Germany . It was actually not good at all. And I really hope the film will be a good movie again. But if I'm thinking that, I would really love it if people were making their own films and not trying to make films that are made of other movies. On this post you might ask for some clarification:

"It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ""ottepel'"" or ""the thaw"", has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman."|1
I like `` Hack . '' Think the `` Lone Ranger '' reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver , a 1950s redneck , a 1964 Ford Explorer and a 1984 Toyota Camry . But, since I have no knowledge of how that happened , I would be wise to take a look at what I've been told about the evolution of the character '' Lone Ranger''. I'll let you see what I've been told, but for now, it seems to me to be clear that the '' Lone Ranger'' was not an '' ordinary'' car in its '' early history''.|0
"My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film, realized it was a Christian movie, and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that ""Christian"" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.To be fair, there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good."|1
The idea behind Dead Silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. There was so much going for this film. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.The film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were soooo stupid! They ran around flailing their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.I know this is a brief review, but I just don't see the need to invest much into this.|1
People call a 976 `` party line '' to talk dirty to strangers , and perhaps meet up for a beer and a drink.'' But it's still far too early for such a public conversation, which is why we're putting in an effort to bring in a couple of good oldies, some good oldies who aren't too much of a deal to get involved, and just a couple of good oldies who aren't too much of a deal to get involved with a good deal of good oldies who have nothing else to do but to get in.|0
"We picked this up as a part of a Brentwood set , under the title `` The Broken Skull .``, to try and make a reference. The name was a reference to a famous piece by James Joyce, ""The Last Judgment."" The piece was on display at the London Art Centre on 6 June 1966, when it had been displayed in the London Museum. It was also in the collections of the Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool, and British Art, and in the archives of the Tate in London."|0
While not truly terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of Beach Boys history.Basically, this movie would have you believe that Mike Love was the brains behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a TV movie so what do you expect? Mike Love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re-write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius.|1
"""The Cave"" got released more or less simultaneously with the English film ""The Descent"", directed by Neil Marshall. Both movies share a similar premise; only ""The Cave"" is dreadfully unoriginal, unexciting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is ""The Descent"". It feels like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, whereas ""The Cave""-director Bruce Hunt simply went for the most rudimentary elaboration of the screenplay that was thrown on his desk."|1
This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moronic political commentary in every imaginable place, and itself deserves a place in the Eighth Circle, Tenth Bolgia with the rest of the falsifiers. Sandow Birk has reserved himself a spot next to it.Stocking Hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, to say nothing of extreme liberal bias. It is, however, unoriginal, tedious and trite.|1
I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious , the script was written and directed by a great director . I have a strong memory of watching the film which was very entertaining and an amazing piece of cinematic entertainment . I'm still not sure if this movie has ever been seen in real life, and I don't know why, but I think this movie does have a very strong character . I was in love with the film at the end of the week , it is the best movie in the history of movies.|0
A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they discover that they are to late. Apparently the government made a scientist test his experiment on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra which made them grow very large. I'm not sure that this movie really needed or deserved explaining since it is almost identical to Curse of the Komodo which also sucked. The computer effects are as cartoony as ever an the komodo roars like a dinosaur which really got on my nerves.|1
This representation of the popular children 's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch . I know it is a bad film but I can't stop thinking about it. How do I go about making a movie to have a character look like that ? What if it was a little bit better? The best way to see a child's life like a movie was in the movie. I'm trying to make a film like this with my friends, but not everyone can make them work. If it was the right thing to be made, I would make a really great movie for my friends.|0
"this show is pretty alright and fun to watch , its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.I really enjoy watching this one. I love it, the characters and the music is pretty catchy. Like a lot of other Disney channels, its a great show, if it is still your thing. I love Disney movies and it is always nice to see a Disney movie in it, you can’t beat it.”

On the other hand, though, the music and lyrics are alright. Not too bad as far as the music goes but I like that song."|0
Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film. but, for whatever reason, I really liked this film. Was it terribly original? No. Was it a bit predictable? Yes. And so what? It was still a really nice movie. I've always liked Bruce Willis (well, almost always, there was Hudson Hawk and The Fifth Element, after all), and he portrayed a selfish, sarcastic b***ard perfectly. Maybe this movie isn't Academy Award material, but it sure is feel good material.|1
... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have Galaxina.This film came out when the Original Star Wars proved there was a market for Science Fiction. This in turn lead to some gems such as Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say obviously, because I hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.I missed it when it came out in 1980.)|1
Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels. There were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of Jim Carrey's character DIck Harper, but the writers never follow up that particular conflict. Basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but Carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey wasn't very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either.|1
I, like many this evening braved the frigid winter and long lines to see what I had anticipated to be one of the best movies of this year. However, I was left sadly wanting in many ways after the credits rolled. But to be fair, there were redeemable qualities (although very few). Let's start with what worked. First, the Lycans: on point in every way  from their terrifying physicality to their sheer ferocity. The action: sublimely visceral  when it did occur. Nighy/Victor and Sheen/Lucian: Perfect. Now, what did not (and there is plenty).|1
This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really didn't understand the guests. I knew they weren't serious but whether they were really them was unclear because...i guess i'm just that stupid. I don't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests aren't real like in Ali g or anything they're played by one man or so i believe. I love the serious look that he's got going on. Its like that programme that was on on a Sunday morning that i forget the name of lol.|1
"The basic idea behind `` Dungeon of Harrow '' is n't all bad . The acting , however , is what made it possible for them to become successful. They could use this technique to create something resembling a dungeon in the real world, which in turn could change the game. Or they could start using it to make something that has the same flavor of gameplay in its place. The real world

A basic dungeon game is very much like a dungeon for players. When it's all in place, the player simply follows the rules of the dungeon."|0
This is an account of events that have been covered in print several times , and I had read two of them before. Here are the original printouts of those articles . I'm very grateful for all of the emails I received, and I am also very pleased with each of them , especially for the new one I've posted below. This one's a good deal better than last , though, but I don't want to take it away from you. I just don't have time for it, so keep it with me in mind as I do that I think your email is really good.|0
Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without passport . She 's a young refugee who has been in the US for more than one year waiting to come back to her hometown of Hong Kong after being rescued by China's government, and then taken back to her family and friends in Australia . The story of a refugee who has spent her entire life in China is a vivid memory from her life in China. She is a refugee living in Hong Kong, trying to get to Australia to go back home .|0
An hulking alien beastie crash-lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off (that is when his aim isn't terribly off) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen! All in all, it's pretty silly stuff. I do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times. I actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects.|1
Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard . For something made by an eighteen year old kid - who has never played the game before - I can't be sure what they mean. . I can only speak of a few reasons for this one though: . I've never been to this game myself. . But I've been to it in more ways. . For example, I bought a CD player, and I've never played the game. I've never actually heard of this game, so I'm not quite sure about the game's sound quality.|0
'Be With Me ' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie . Just leave it running in the background . chat with me. It's not that hard to live with when you're a kid, you get to do it. Just have fun with it. I don't know why you thought that was so hard but I have no problem being with the right person, right now. Just have fun. Don't think that you're going to get it right. But if you don't and don't like it.|0
When I was driving home after work , I bought some movies for my four year old twins . I didn't know which of those movies I was watching but it turns out . The one that you see all the time is the one in which we see all the time. Now I'm not sure why, I have read this and I have even found it to be a good read! And it's a film that you read because I have always read it a lot . I have read this movie and I still can't understand why that was so bad.|0
"I can't disagree with a previous comment that ""Driving Lessons"" is more than a little twee, but one man's indictment is another's endorsement, I suppose. In my book this film succeeds on pure charm, no small feat in itself.I can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it, but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway. Julie Walters' Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress."|1
"Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. If you can even call it a film. This looks like some first-year art school project, hastily cobbled together.The ""talents"" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious.The film in no way reflects Malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here. I live in Malaysia, BTW.Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival. And unfortunately, that ploy seems to have worked."|1
Ty Cobb is, by far, the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live. His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. Every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. So of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author Al Stump. Now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards.|1
Badly shot , badly edited , clumsy dialogue , flat characters , unsuccessful adaption of a novel . It does not do the same as it would in some of the movies . It is more interesting, if you know what it's about , than it is , and that it is . And that is just it , to tell you that it's not the only part of art you need it to be the most important . But what is your opinion on this ? Is this the greatest part ? Is that it? The other thing is the art that comes out and shows us how it should be .|0
"How can ANYBODY give this anything higher than a '1'?I thought ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. Indeed, I didn't think anything COULD be worse.I was wrong. ""Galaxina"" is that rare movie where EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. How often have you watched a movie and commented, ""Who the hell LIT this thing?"" From lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . ."|1
This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts . Donald Trump became the man to tell him he had to fight. Trump's dream was to give his country an honest life, but it became impossible to live in the way he had hoped . The dream, like all dreamers, was one of betrayal and destruction . Trump told the man to take his dreams seriously. Trump said it was about taking his dreams seriously . He said he wanted to do it because he wanted to do something that could be done and would be done again .|0
"Having just watched Acacia, I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here. I like Asian, and Korean horror, and I had great expectations for this film. Man, was i disappointed. Watching this, I kept thinking ""surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on"", and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realised that the film really is that bad. It is the cheapest cash in into the Asian horror market I have seen so far."|1
"STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I've seen in quite some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer, cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80's horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness, preposterous situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the ""excessive violence"" and ""gratuitous nudity"" that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love."|1
"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece, or a lemon: there's little middle ground. Putting it gently, this is not ""Berlin - symphony of a city"" or ""Man with a Movie Camera"". Unfortunately, it's not much to look at, either.The problem with this one is that it's glib and half-baked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It doesn't really have anything to say, or rather, to show us with pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis."|1
This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I watched the manga review in a magazine, I thought it was maybe interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized it was a complete stupidity.OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK, and the series have an standard. But as the plot advances, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show some mystical based upon the Christian mythologies, but it's a total stupidity. It features some demons and stigmata scenes... Totally nonsense.|1
Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone . Even a man with more than ten years of business experience would know that, but he is so far away. I’m not really sure I see what he is doing, though. I believe he may have an idea or two, but I doubt it. I don’t believe he has any idea or plan for how to go about shooting a film or video, because he has no idea what to shoot. That would be the one he is currently shooting.|0
OH MY God I am lost Now I know everything this guy does is Pointless R J A wrote at 7:27 AM I can't wait to see what he has done to his wife's children. I don't know what to think about that. I have seen so many people get killed by this and it's really horrible to watch. I can't wait for this to go away. You've been a lifesaver for the last 3 months and I don't think we'll ever make it back. I'm praying for my husband.|0
This movie was, of the 67 of 71 best pictures I have seen, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years/ still in love/ not even a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress-woman's party? This film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of African-Americans that I have ever seen. It makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) look downright progressive!|1
OK, so this is horror? I get horror - but I don't get horrific. Black & white is artistic but too much black is overkill.....enough said about the lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... lot's of these around. It's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done.....but I hope not. My question is , when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? I guess the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. Well that's been done before too.|1
I guess I should now comment upon a 4th flick in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise ; the sequels still surprise me and I'll be hard pressed not to get that into the film I'm looking forward to watching. 1. It was good. I liked it, I thought I liked it. I didn't know that I could watch the trilogy of 4th Flicks in one place and still watch them without any trouble at all. I was going to skip the 3rd FFL's sequels and just skip them because it had so much potential for me to enjoy.|0
"There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting , plot , effects , continuity , etc. There are also a host of other elements to this movie that you may not have considered. So let's make this one up. I will start by giving you a list of the most important and most important elements of this film. Directing the Movie

You will have to wait for more to find out what the actors and crew are all doing. You will have to wait for several hours in order to figure out what to do with this."|0
Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic . Rosemary 's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied in a series of TV films. At first glance it looks as if Rosemary's story is more about her own mother and father than the original film. But she's more about her father than her mother and is in her own life the most compelling character in all of her movies. But she's not as good as it would appear to be on this list, or that list. Her father is portrayed by her friend, who has been watching all the movie series since they first met.|0
I don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: I hope that someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki...) someday will direct the REAL Neverending story.|1
I suppose I'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. These laboratory movies (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the laboratory), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time. Of course, they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that Dr. Frankenstein's did. There is always something they didn't anticipate. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here.|1
I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue, as well as the language, very well formed in the English. I was hoping this was something that we’d all been thinking about long before. But that was never going to be the case. The English had been in decline for a long time before we started, and it’s been hard not to think about what was happening there. This is not the way I’ve read the blog. It’s not, and never will be.|0
I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half the cast must be retired porno actors, and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting.The graphics are unlike anything I have ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more believability. They can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Perhaps I should also note how incredibly impressed I am at the number of 'bullets' their pistols can hold.|1
It seems like an exciting prospect , a modern-dress `` Othello '' with Christopher Eccleston , who was so frighteningly charming and interesting in such a way as to have a full-time job on the day he came to London. One of my friends was an English teacher in the mid-1960s who had been working on a project for the department for a very long time before he realised that he had to do an English version of Shakespeare's 'I Am a Bird' because he had to be told that he could make money from it. Well, it turned out that he was not as good at it as he thought.|0
The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It's hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. Supposedly set in the 70s, there is scant attention paid to period details, with overly muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location, the bleachers.|1
The story of a Volcano erupting downtown L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a disaster movie. This one though, is missed bigtime. The movie looks chaotic, has a storyline which is hard to follow or believe and the acting was very bad.Im in agreement with a lot of comments that Lee Jones is only good at bossing people around as a chief in some particular field. In this one, he is heading the emergency office. Being chief of such an office it naturally is a good idea to bring along your daughter to dangerous scenes. Clever thinking.|1
"Let 's face it , a truly awful movie , no ... I mean a `` truly '' awful movie.'' This is not a movie or any other movie, it's really a movie and a movie and it makes you laugh out loud and cry. ""The only way to avoid the horror of a movie on a television ... is to put a ''dance,'' in which you're dancing to a 'dance'' that the actor you're acting is doing. You'll get an opportunity for a great performance on ''The Last of Us''."|0
Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on the game. It would be foolish to think R DOGS is a complete or even accurate comparison to the Game of Life, since R DOGS is a collection of games released in the last year. There are two main reasons to doubt that the game can be compared to any games released since 2000. First, the game is very much like any other video game game. The combat system is very similar, and the dialogue is almost identical.|0
This is one of the best action films I have seen . Geena 's portrayal of the tough as nails in action movies is brilliant and I was surprised how much she can get out of it , so it should be done with great care and will be done with no effort . It is also a great addition to film school for a reason , and it will have an all around great cinematography . Geena's characters look fantastic in action films (as in the movie) and if she's in the mood for more action .|0
I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun caper flick and thought about what would happen if we decided to take over for the next two years and then make their next appearance. It didn’t exactly feel like that, though, but that’s because I had the time to get to grips with some things. And I loved it. First I thought about what my career would be without me. But it turns out I was already working in the industry, right? I’ve gotten better and better and better.|0
8/2008 . When I originally wrote my comments , shortly after first seeing this film , I took a critical shot of the original film and took a look at the new film on the internet. It was quite interesting and was a little strange that I had not been able to see the film at all. I also saw the same film on my phone but I haven’t found a movie I like to look at it. So, here is a photo of my first look at the new film and the other pictures in my gallery.|0
Bought for £1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Wooden acting,lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see. PV is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull,stupid and crap as humanly possible.A vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control.|1
While I can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography (I thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low-fi, home movie feel) I must say that I thought the script and acting of WHAT ALICE FOUND were excellent! Dean Bell has crafted a real gem that Judith Ivey charms with character-driven delight. Her performance of Sandra is a pleasure -- unfolding, alternately, as diabolical and romantic. We are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions... and never given more information than is necessary. Her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet Bell's post-modern fairy tale with arms wide open.|1
I rated this movie a 3 and that was generous . The scenery is ponderous and gaudy , the acting is well done but the actors seem to have some issues with acting and it's a little hard to distinguish between that and the acting. The movie is funny as hell but I wouldn't recommend it. I would really recommend it if you have any other ideas of how to approach that movie. I'm sure that you will have some ideas about how you should go about it. I would also recommend it if you are looking to get some money out of your account.|0
Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero.|1
Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Welsh to be an infantile artist , helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best, when the world and the world at large seem so far apart, and yet have so often come close to becoming the same thing in ways that we do. It's not so much a matter that the work of such an extraordinary individual, to whom I am not a part of this world, has been born. It's not as if the whole world, or, as we would have them to be, the entire world has been left behind.|0
This forth film in the `` Angel Guts '' saga , which at only a few minutes above an hour ago, was about to be filmed as a video production, and the story is very much in the same vein. The story began on Friday, 4 June, 2011 (12/14) and concluded on Tuesday, 12 October, 2011 (3/28). As mentioned in our previous post, Angel Guts had already released two film sets, one of which was based on the story, and the second one was filmed entirely on DVD.|0
For the record , I hate spoof movies . Except for Mel Brooks and AIRPLANE ! because those are classics . If I had the money to pay for something , I'd probably put a record at my own expense . So I decided not to buy any of it. And even though I think I will get a few, I don't know what will happen. Anyhow, if I buy some of these CDs , I don't know the difference . And if I bought a record , then I wouldn't have to pay $20 .|0
I just saw this movie tonight. Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too, but it was way better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie feeling great. The acting was excellent, which is something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU, think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor.|1
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film, but this is not true. I did enjoy the movie, but was probably expecting too much.Adele, who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon, did not come off as a very likable character. She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old.|1
This film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget. Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There is your basic bar brawl, alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama, but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I don't know.|1
This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst Biblical theme film ever... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they've put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They've described Lot as a friend of Noah although he lived after Noah. To make things worse, later Lot became a pirate and attacks Noah's Ark during the flood!!!??? And what's with the merchant who comes along on a boat which is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism??? And exchanges alcohol for a food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as alcoholic!?|1
"Wow. I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago, and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually.Never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those Halloween green marshmallows.Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then, there was ""The Shining. ""The plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog."|1

Ik know it is impossible to keep all details of a book in a movie . But this movie has been around for more than a decade. So what should I do? Before we go to the movie, I would like to talk a little about the concept behind the idea. Let's start with what it was called back in the 1980's, from a book called What is Your Book? that was published in 1979. This book is based around the work of an artist who wrote the book and is now at the bottom of the story.|0
I supposed 'Scarecrow Gone Wild ' is a dull slasher flick . Yes , it have some good point , but when you are going to do the film, it will have a lot of good stuff. It's not that it is boring, but it can be boring when you want a bit of it. But then again, if you are going to take a really big budget, you will have to pay extra for a movie. If you want to take a budget and don't want the film to go out of budget, the film is fine.|0
I 'm a large scarred heterosexual male ex-bouncer , ex-rugby player , and ex-boxer , and I love this movie.It is about two men, one in the middle and one in the back who get together over a certain amount of time in order to try and fix their relationship, which is one of their main problems is that sometimes we all feel we are missing something important, but we can't be sure what it is.When I was a young adult , I knew there were only two people that would be perfect for each other.|0
The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel, by Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not that I had ever heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series. The first movie got released way back in 1927, simultaneously with the novel. Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations.Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood. She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one.|1
"I 've never written a comment on IMDb before , but this movie was so bad it left me little time to comment

I have watched this one for about a year now, and it's so good but I have no idea why. It is not as good as the last one I had, but I would have given it a few years longer if I hadn't done it in the beginning. This is from the time they first posted it I never did like it. This was posted a couple of months ago, on my website about a few months ago when they posted it on the site."|0
This is a entertaingly bad b-movie. Actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies. It had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I have seen worse acting. The zombies were great, clearly these were Romero zombies, and was really a interesting zombie story. Obviously not Oscar material, and if your not into zombie movies, or b-movies you probably wont enjoy this, but if you are you'll like this movie.The main clint eastwood knockoff western character guy is pretty good, although they never really clearly explain how he can heal himself from gunshots and zombie bites.|1
"The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad , although it is . The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it's terrible ; it's just that . If we were to take a look at her and realize it's not bad , perhaps we should look closer . . . If you're going to study her at all , you should probably look at the way her eyes ""looked"" on me. I'm not sure what is wrong with her eyes, but they are beautiful. She is not like me , she does not have eyes, but they do, in her eyes."|0
For those viewers who thought the 1979 film `` Alien '' the first to depict a male Earthling being impregnated by a female biological child, it is no coincidence that it was also one of the most significant films of the past 20 years. For those who had hoped to see the film at all, it was no small accomplishment to watch it during its 60th birthday on May 17. It was an honor to see the movie at the opening of its 60th anniversary. It will be released by Sony and is free for everyone to see and enjoy in theaters on the Internet.|0
This cheapo remake of the terrific Five Star Final suffers from terrible acting. Humphrey Bogart stars as the manager of a sleazoid radio station that is desperate to boost sagging ratings. The owner decides to have a series of morality plays written about a famous murder case from 20 years ago. So they hire the fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to track down the murderess, who was acquitted and has been living quietly under a fake name. The preacher arrive on the daughter's wedding day, but the ruthless radio station refuses to back off exposing the mother and ruining their lives.Bogart is always good.|1
Incident on and off a Mountain Road is Don Coscarelli 's entry in Mick Garris ' Masters of Horror series which has been released on DVD in North America on March 25th (as of March 28th), and on DVD as a stand-alone video game (as of March 21st). On March 28th, 2010, it will be revealed on the DVD as a stand-alone game, and on March 21st, 2020, will be released as a fully-animated set on DVD as a stand-alone video game, as well as a limited edition DVD.|0
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two being The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.I have always had a fascination with UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO investigation that was not a comedy. But after about 30 minutes, it all went horribly wrong.I could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none here.|1
"If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical (or Torah) portrayal of the events in Exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood fashion people who are not even in the Bible have been ""created"" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. Jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a Shepherd priest who gave Moses excellent advise. God is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that Moses had to figure things out for himself."|1
"I am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes . I feel comfortable writing it now , but I'm a bit worried about what the next 10 mins will be. Here's how I'll go about getting all of this in order :  

1. You'll need some time for it to load the film. If it isn't ready, you'll need to give it an update. Once it has finished loading, put it into a temporary folder, then run it again in the film manager. 2."|0
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it . . . I didn’t think that I would see that way again . . . I think I did . . . I thought it was a great story because she did a really good job . . . and I think the people I have talked to . . . were there . . . and I really enjoyed her as an author . . .

As a fan of nearly any period drama , and at that a huge Jane Austen fan , I was looking forward to the end of the first season of The Lord of the Rings but I have not yet gotten over that feeling . . . and this is my first time watching the first season. . . . And so, I am going to tell you a little bit of everything I have to say about it. In this first season, I felt I could just keep talking and just sit back and watch the movie as if it never happened.|0
"""Hardbodies 2"" is harmless, aimless and plot less. I would add ""brainless"" to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. The scenery has changed from the California beaches to the Greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with Pam Grier in ""The Big Doll House"")."|1
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war.|1
A couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks. My friend grabbed Head of the Family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. Well you guessed it, it was me!!!!!!!! I have never been so embarrised in all my life.|1
***SPOILERS*** Feeling alone and needing companionship as well as love Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she goes through life as a popular young single lady who has many high class friends. But for reasons of her own deep insecurity she keeps them at arms length. As for Frances male friends non are anywhere near her age so that she won't have any reason to have any romantic involvement with them. One early evening as Frances was entertaining some of her friends she spots outside her apartment window a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the cold pouring rain.|1
I watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick. The shonky production values and low-rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci-fi channel style knock offs.The central performance from Bill Moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act. The rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever.The cinematography is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kind of films.|1
Not good. Mostly because you don't give a damn about what happens to all these people. Some comments : 1. I am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils, never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil, who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds, says something 2. Fine, so Rosina has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer. But Charles is completely different in all aspects from her father - if anything Henry is much closer as a sensual, exalted person 3.|1
This is one of those movies where the acting , set location , direction , and effects were so bad. They are so bad that if they did a really bad job at making it look so boring, they would take out the director because of this. And yet there they are, that movie was filmed for, because of this. There is not even a script. No, not even a picture. This is an example of how bad it is. A bad movie, they will shoot it, and I don't care how they do it because they are bad at it.|0
Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard. For something made by an eighteen year old film student, I would say bravo, but that is not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffitti stick to the documentaries. It is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film. The plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around Portland writing graffitti. He is joined by another and they skate around together creating art.|1
"When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry. It completely blew in my opinion. I didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell, let's see. I'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. My guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole ""i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff, oh noes what is happening, oh its a dream, oh its not a dream, oh wait i see something spooky, oh never mind""-sucky storyline."|1
I completely understand WHY this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump-factor....What I don't understand is why THIS movie was made... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and dissatisfying film.There's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could, but for those of you who prefer to waste your money, DON't READ ON. The film is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a non-issue.|1
OK, so maybe it's because I'm from the North East of Scotland and I talk just like the guys in this film, but I found this great fun. Cheap fun to be sure, but plenty of effort has gone into making the film look great and the actors certainly give it all. I was actually quite effected when they died. In particulare when the Captain finally fell. The script? Well it;s a game of 2 halfs. The opening half of the film is well written and sharp. The last half hour is not so great, with many questions left unanswered.|1
Dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything in fact. The most compelling performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film. The director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement.Presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between. This sort of thing has been done better by lots of others. Don't go out of your way to see it.|1
and there are not many in cinema history . `` Rouge '' seems to be a bit of a hope for Hollywood. But you see it everywhere. It makes for a fantastic film. So what can we all do about it? I think people should be aware of the idea that movies should be made in a way that does not go down too well with the rest of humanity. That way, the filmmakers can be brought back to life. And we can also look forward to movies in the next two decades, if we want to achieve a more peaceful and stable world.|0
I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance.I have watched the original from the beginning and I am so excited for the continuation of that series.I am sure that this show will be a little bit different from the original but I can't wait to watch it again!It's my first TV series and this has not been seen before...and I have never watched an episode from the first season but I am so looking forward to it and will be playing this one for years to come. I love that series and I am so excited to get back on the road with it!|0
It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. Just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater.|1
For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. The reviews I've written thus far have been for films that I love, respect, and admire, and I have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. A life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out.|1

"My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the ""MTV"" logo appeared. It might as well been called ""National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose."" And it did play to the ""MTV"" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film."|1
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades.|1
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in there or something like that. It's a very good place for a place to start and it is great for that kind of thing. I would recommend you try it as often as possible when you want to make more money. I have never been there and i have had to pay a little bit more than $20/month for 1 year and it was still a little over $1,000. Maybe a year or two but you could do with some money.|0
Well , this is about as good as they come . There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a little drunk and a bit on the off chance of a bad movie. But then there is the debate about why he was made. There is the question whether there were more or less of these people. The main thing that makes this movie is that he was a good man and he got that. It is a lot to like, but there is also that other element of the film to be had. It is, in a way, the most interesting movie.|0
`` While sporadically engrossing ( including a few effectively tender moments ) and humorous , the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'Homecoming ' is certainly not to be discounted as a work of art, but as a whole, it is rather to be considered. It is the kind of piece that has been used by writers, film and television and television critics alike, and by many film-makers in particular; it is not by any means an art piece, as it is in fact a piece of art, and it may have been used by someone who was at the time a movie director.|0
This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : '' quirky '' and obnoxious characters who don't fit in with everyone. And for the sake of making this movie interesting, I suggest that you read my review. I'll tell you why I like this movie. This is a very well produced movie and one that the director can use for his first action film. And for that reason, I like this movie a lot! It is a very well executed movie and I'm very excited about it.|0
"This is one of the best martial art ( Kung-fu ) movies of all time . if u love martial arts . but its a bit hard to get to learn it but the movies are worth it . its very easy to learn it . it is not as easy as other things like that . and you can learn more on it . It is hard to not learn it but if you are looking for a martial art film then you might have better luck on it . you can go and learn it by yourself

Kung Fu is a very hard to master with Kung Fu ."|0
I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. The only thing I enjoyed about it was when Robin Williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. Glenn Close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp's would have had her kids taken away by the Department of Children and Families. Robin Williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me.|1
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward ... granted i am still in shock from what i’ve learned over the past three months (and for that I am thankful). I just want to make sure that all this continues. I think that I am starting to think that if I did this right, I could be doing something very profound. That I could be able to use all my skills to do what I was doing, but that would be something I could not do in real life.|0
Corben Bernsen directed horror film about a chemical weapon being released in a sporting event and turning everyone in to fear-inducing firecrackers is a must-watch movie. But it’s a much bigger movie than all the others, and one that I have no doubt will be watched by at least a couple hundred million people in the coming months. So, I’ve gone on a few posts about how the movie looks and what it’s like to have a weapon being used to take out a man’s gun in the film. But, here’s the bottom line about it.|0
First, let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is. So the book may have been great, but the movie isn't.I have spent my entire life living in the Peidmont region of NC. I have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie. I have lived in two small NC towns and Charlotte and Raleigh. On occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but I have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of Gone with the Wind.In response to Gore_Won from the atheist community.|1
"Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie ""Son of the Mask."" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this?"|1
The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots. Here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them. It comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties.|1
Man , what an awful film . As with many terrible films , the structure of its awfulness lies in the actions of its protagonists. The story is a tragedy, not a comedy . Instead of turning the film into comedy , instead of being a good story , we should try to learn the stories from their characters and see how it feels. I have always enjoyed the series , but the most disappointing of the first few movies in terms of the second and the second film in terms of the ending, is how much of a bad thing that has gone on when the main characters are introduced to this story .|0
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy, it gets right in to it right from the start, there's no boring build up. The chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were believable! Would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions. The story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details, to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment.|1
"I heard legends about this ""film"" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I impatiently started watching it. By the end, I *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.This may be the worst film I've even ""touched"" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. ""Manson Family"" makes the bottom of Troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork."|1
A young man, named Danny, has run away from home and meets a drifter, named Bix, who agrees to tag along with Danny and watch out for him... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy, naive girl working in her father's diner. Bix starts seeing Carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter, see? He's no good! Understand?). Meanwhile, the town creep, Jesse (played by a perfectly casted Jack Elam), keeps showing up at the diner and bothering Carrie.|1
Andy McDermott ( Tom Everett Scott ) is a shy American teenager spending vacation in Paris with his friends Braden and Mattie Scott. In the summer of last year, he and his wife, Jessica, travel to the Alps and fly to Italy. It was during his first summer in Italy that he and Jessica met Braden. In the summer of '96, Mattie was in Paris with his friends Mattie and Mike, and Braden. In summer '96, they were living in Paris. It was during their first summer in Rome that Tom and Mattie met Braden and Josh.|0
Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century , Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded as one of the most reliable and popular British politicians, and with an impressive track record in the English press. He has also become well known by the British newspaper The Express. Erwin Rommel died in the year 1994, aged 72. He is survived by eight children; the eldest son of a former prime minister. He is also survived by all three of his grandchildren, all of whom are British born and English born, and a number of other well-known British and international personalities.|0
I have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously. But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediately.The first five minutes of these series were... acceptable.|1
Like Margot in `` Fear of Fear '' falls victim of her ambitious husband , like Fox in `` Foxy '' falls victim of her own husband, and is a lesbian, but it turns out she is also a lesbian , and that she is also gay , and that if her husband (a man) were to get a divorce, the whole family would feel the need to put her out with all the drama of being gay. But even though they are both lesbian, Margot is still in the same situation. She is an attractive young woman , who is not ashamed, and she is not shy.|0
The only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack , their choices and viewpoints. It is difficult to say how their choices and viewpoints will affect your decision, but it is worth the time to consider that, as it is a great piece of documentation. I am currently in my second year of university and have read a couple of books (and the other three are available on Amazon if you know what I mean) and will try to make it to the top of the library as I finish the project.|0
I have noticed that a lot of films that have been featured on `` Mystery Science Theater '' have received very few positive reviews. So I decided that I would post a post about them on their site. On this page, you can search the name of a movie that you love. If you like it, it's also an option for you to find the movie you love. So if you want to submit it, please make sure you're the right person. You may think that you will find the movie, but after reading this blog, you're really going to find it.|0
"This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick . And of course us Americans just might not be as keen on the movie as I would have us believe. I hope that someone is looking out for this project. Thursday, July 16, 2012

Here's how to go about making the film:

Make the cut, take the first and second shots, and make the second one on the cut. In one of the cut there are two options:

Use your imagination to decide whether or not to use the first shot or use the second."|0
Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August , a single mother who 's the working definition of 'mother' (and also a woman on the other side of the family). There are no real rules about what happens to these children, but I have a couple of reasons for why I believe a mother and her children will eventually become mothers. They'll grow up as a single young woman who will find a role model of her own in the world of family living. For my money, one of the two most important roles of mother and child is a role of raising the kids.|0
"What we know of Caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas. His works' themes were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred within the profane. He lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim ""strangling the boy for the purity of his scream"".You can't fault Derek Jarman for his cinematography, nor his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings and you certainly can't accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality."|1
I have never been as surprised by a film that was this old . Only `` The Treasure of the Sierra Club'' does not appear, but we all know that when one gets too old, one can forget it. It would be easy to understand why. However, it's not like there's anything new in it, so it's interesting to see what else it was. In fact, there are a couple of great movies that I don't like about it, and that I can't really relate to.|0
Although it was dark, depressing, and at times hard to watch, You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog. It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships. In addition, the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched. Her compelling and believable performance made the movie. It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute. Who knows.|1
"Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages. The movie focuses around ""Fizzy"" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This tv film was just great. The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation."|1
"Having worked professionally with young girls on the run, I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age, Mother/Daughter Estrangement, The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged, Who is the Good Samaritan, Tragedy is in Every Life & the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. The cast really ""sells"" their roles."|1
I wasn't sure where this was headed until the ending. when it turned out that this was all a liberal conspiracy to hand the world over to European wimps and the United Nations. What a load of right-wing crud! Incidentally, the bit about Canada joining the US didn't really have much to do with the plot at all and the idea was never developed. The only point of it seems to be that it made the main character eligible to run for President(but they could have just made him American and dispensed with that).|1
"One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third. What’s Your Reaction:

This is an archive of reactions from more than 1,100 responses to the film. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I’m really sorry for the bad language in the comments, if it makes any difference. I don’t want to do another review but I have some thoughts to make sure to include them. I really appreciate all the positive comments."|0
For many year I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture I can only think this is just another karate film. A black shinobi and some weapons doesn't make a ninja, it's much more than that. The ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything, killing whatever try to stop them. This movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand.|1
"Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson, while on an assignment for Germany.The songs are beautiful. The two are well-paired. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. A half-German, half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I, Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs. I loved the film. Some will say it's a ""chick-flick,"" but so what. It's wonderful. Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped."|1
The first feature length Muppet Movie , and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol , the movie puppeteers the world over had been watching as a whole for a long time , but since then, they have been watching . . . and that is why the first time around , I can’t get my mind off how this is going to come out :-). The first thing that people seem to think about is the difference in the way people see the characters, since the main characters are in one world and the characters are in another.|0
Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature , and not because it 's not without trying. The game has the potential for a sequel, even a reboot, and there is a lot of hype around it. But there has never been a better time to have a feature than at the beginning. I think you have all the right arguments to make . . . I've been playing for over seven years now and I'm really enjoying all the exciting things around the game, and I know I'm getting close to a lot of them.|0
First of all , i have nothing against Christianity . i believe , every person has the right to believe , however i have never heard of any person who has . i think it is important for people to keep the faith and do not believe the faith , i also hope that people can keep faith and do not believe . i also hope that we can be free to believe , in order to keep our religion , but we should not take it for granted that the faith should be held, and not for granted that our religion is right and perfect , and so on .|0
This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame , fake-looking bird puppet which is all you need. Now you have to get the real thing, to make a fake bird puppet. You don't get the real thing for free as it's all the same stuff as a moovie. That's how you make a moovie. You don't see a bird puppet in real life - it goes with the moovie, but it's not the real thing. The moovie is a really simple game - you start the game with some simple instructions.|0
"This demented left-wing wipe-out trivializes Dante 's great work , distorts the genius of the author out of all recognition. It makes the author's world seem larger than it is."" I disagree with the authors of The Devil in the Machine. I find Dante a strange and bizarre figure. He is so unlike any man I have seen or experienced before. But the author and critic are both more than interesting and interesting. The Devil in the Machine is interesting because he is funny and clever, but I don't think it's any more than Dante is, and I don't believe he's even funnier."|0
"I won't bore you with any synopsis, chances are you already know them. And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work.I STRONGLY disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that ""Park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah."" Because you know what? He HAS!!! The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with, how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of ""Sympathy For Mr Vengeance"" with the frantic and extravagance of ""Oldboy""?"|1
Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has just been accepted for the title of West Coast basketball coach. But, if he was to coach West Coast again in 2012-13, he'd need to put together an entirely new basketball team with a better reputation. So it's all about winning the title, and I'm sure this would be an easier title to get an even easier one than the recent one. That is, until West Coast faces its first team to the NCAA Tournament in the summer.|0
... when we all know, no one does it like the BBC.Being an avid fan of this sort of Sunday night watching, i was quite looking forward to this. How disappointed was I! In the first thirty seconds I didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch.However me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. The plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style.|1
"This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots , dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly , but is well made and made in a great way. Its a great movie and has great visuals, but is not bad in it. The only thing you need to do is download the film for free. You can download the free version for more information

I really liked this movie. I have been a big fan of this film for several years, but this one really made me sad. It had the great visuals of the film and it was good to watch."|0
What a waste of energy and money . What a waste of what talent there was.Emilio Estevez was completely wasted on the way out of this mess. If I had only known what we had to do to get him back out, I would have found him. I don't think he had anything to do but just let me have a look, and see if I could figure out some way to get him out. There were several hours after the show that we had to leave, but we got up and walked back up the ramp.|0
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of film it gets out of whack and goes to bed at 4:30 or 5:30 or 6:00 in the morning. It's not all bad. It's still an entertaining movie when you get home from a day out. You could watch the movie on the sofa or the computer if you're not at bed time. You can watch it at night too, but it's not the best thing you can do for yourself. I really liked it.|0
UP AT THE VILLA (2000) **1/2WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt's hard to know what is the point in UP AT THE VILLA, a gorgeous but shallow period piece, one of those made with the only objective of earning Oscar nominations for best costume design and art-set direction (one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome). It has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her.|1
Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any youngaspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using toline a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching thismovie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases.|1
This Is one of those classic American made for TV movies that are just made for watching on a rainy night. It might seem like the perfect place for it, but the story and the art are so well-done that you wonder why you wouldn't like them in the first place, but then again, the first time I ever watched an American made movie was to find a recipe for it, which I suppose is why I love these so much. You can buy them from the store here or at Amazon or at a local grocery store.|0
If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! If you have however... After having read the books several times, over many years, I have come to love the characters and story, and feel I Know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character-gallery. Thus for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline.|1
This movie was made by Daiei Studios, known for its Gamera movies. It is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men. He claims his throne, forcing his former's two children to flee into the woods, where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 years. In those time that passed, the new samurai lord has proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley. Therefore, it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone statue, which is where a demon god sleeps; they want the god to help them.|1
"I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least LIKE this movie. Also, I'm Canadian and this is a mostly-Canadian movie so I was prepared to cut it some serious slack. Nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is ""Airborne"". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me a break. The acting throughout the movie was so bad I am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. I now have only two wishes in my life.1. I hope that you never have to sit through this movie."|1
"Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.It's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one night stand, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love.Many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent KST movies (e.g. the English Patient), but have far less appeal.After the first half-hour I started checking my watch, wondering if I'd make it home in time to catch Leno on tv.I passed up ""Gladiator"" to see this!? !"|1
I haven't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III. Both shows sold out, and for good reason. The Man With the Screaming Brain was the best movie to see with a crowd full of geeks. (Hey, I'm a dork too.) Bruce Campbell was present and had the whole crowd in stitches! The movie was cheesy in the best possible way. It may be the funniest movie that Bruce has done. Ted Raimi steals the show with his Bulgarian hip hop-itude and zany facial expressions, he is a laugh riot!|1
Sony Pictures Classics , I 'm looking at you ! Sony 's got the rights to Harry records -- you'll have to visit them. I can't find anything on YouTube, so I'd like to see some clips. Do they exist in the U.S? What makes these movies so much fun? Are there other films you like? Do they have any special effects that you like to use? Let me know by commenting below! If you'd like to play these movies I would like to have a look at these.|0
So, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original with a bunch of obnoxious environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds a Cobra. Most of the movie is spent listening to the self-righteous characters prattle on about the evil capitalist pigs, while sandwiched between this cavalcade of condescension are flashbacks to what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were conducted, critters started to grow, people spoke to each other without coming off as being morally superior jerks, etc.|1
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum. Well, anything that isn't I'm a Cyborg at least. Park's newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes, that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin. Park creates a uniquely Korean, and uniquely Park, vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop.|1
"I'm not a movie snob. I've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and I've hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with critics here--""Galaxina"" is just substandard. Clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. ""Galaxina"" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard. ""Galaxina"" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called ""The Blue Star""."|1
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal . Such an amazing relationship between parents and sons. It seems that Muthamittal is one of our most trusted and caring mothers, but I have yet to find anything wrong. But is there really a difference in the relationship between dad and son? My son has two sisters who are close in age: 1) father and 2) daughter. So it would be the case of a dad and a son. I had not read the story for years when I started, so there is a connection between father and son.|0
This fantasy was utter garbage . I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies , but this was the first time I saw any of them for real . There is not a single good fantasy about Michael Moore that I would love to see in a mainstream movie , so I can only assume that it's not the first movie I saw as a kid! . In other news, there has been some news on the YouTube page of a website that claims to be the official channel of the US House of Representatives, but is apparently not doing anything.|0
In my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash ! ! ! ! ! and if you go to the right side of the post the movie was pretty good :P ! I was watching that movie and it made me laugh and I just watched it and then I saw the picture of the car and it wasn't bad. But I didn't see the movie and it didn't really do much for me and I would have to watch it again if I don't know the movie that I want and I know what I should watch.|0
Everyone has their choice for `` worst movie they 've ever seen . '' Some like to pick on Gigli because they think he's cool, while others think it's for a character who's too good to be out of reach of the audience, or to keep them on their toes and keep the camera around them. They've all heard a few good things about him from his fans before. It's a shame there weren't so many bad things about him. The first time he's made it work, it's the same film as the second time he's made it work.|0
When a friend and I saw this in the recent releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that neither of us had heard of it before. We both like Costas Mandylor and it had James Coburn so we figured it couldn't be that bad. We were wrong. It was. It was REALLY that bad. No actor or actress could have made this film worth seeing. It was like taking Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and some nuclear bomb film and trying to cut and paste it all together.I must admit that there were a couple of chuckles.|1
Like another poster mentioned Ch . 56 ( a local Boston TV station ) showed this multiple times over the last few years. Last night I watched the series, and the first two episodes lasted a while longer. There is one or the other, and as you may recall, I wasn't sure what I'd watch. Since I didn't have time to watch it it took me at least another 2-3 hours to get my brain set up so I could focus on the next episode (I didn't do that last night after watching it.)|0
This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother's stories. Its up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince.|1
This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and an older woman in a non-Christian environment and a man in a non-Christian community. This is really interesting because there are multiple examples where Christian and non-Christian families in different environments are associated with different kinds of life, and the two groups are more similar than the other. This film may also show that the father/mother relationship can be quite complicated and that there is always a big difference between these two types of relationships.|0
Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie . She wears her hair in a buzz cut to make it shine. . In this story, you can find her a few minutes before you watch her film and you will see her dress like she is a queen. She wears her dress like a queen and her hair like her hair. . In the story, she will have a little more variety when she puts on a sexy dress. . Then she will go on to a very special moment in the film.|0
"Intelligent summary , is n't it ? If Mad Max was something of a simple , straight forward , nothing would come of it , except if he gets a chance to be the ""perfect man"" he will be a complete and utter man. The point of the statement is that if he's the perfect man, then he'll have to do something else with him. If he doesn't, then if he does, he won't be what he used to be and will be nothing but nothing. That's not the case with him as an actor , or in any other situation of the moment."|0
I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot.|1
"Kazuo Komizu strikes again with ""Entrails of a Beautiful Woman"", the sequel to ""Entrails of a Virgin"". This time around the story is based around a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to take on the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a doped-up and raped patient that winds up on her doorstep one day. When she gets over her head and the Yakuza capture her, she learns their insidious plat of doping up girls and selling them into slavery. It apparently ends badly when she overdoses from the cocaine."|1
Eh . This is a popcorn movie , nothing more . I watched this with a bunch of friends ( i don’t have the time or the money , it’ll be too big to get a movie in it ) and they all said it was amazing . I had to watch the trailer, but I love it , it was great . I loved the popcorn movie , the atmosphere was a bit of a drama , it was so good! I will never get another movie on this channel again because I never will ever watch a movie on one channel .|0
Leonard can write lyrics , but he sure ca n't sing . Nor has he had an original idea in his mind . It is almost impossible to know what an original lyric would mean to someone who's not an original person. If you ask him why he's not an original author, that would be silly. He's probably got the idea that it's impossible to describe what he's written, but you might want to ask yourself if you can really make sense of him. The following is a short poem by Leonard Nimoy, the son of George Leonard.|0
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. The movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. The seventeen year old, Ben, decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. It is very comical and touching. I honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.|1
This movie was so awful that I can't even describe it. I was amazed that I even sat through this pile of trash. I couldn't believe that a movie like this was even thought of. It was a about a serial killer that clucks like a chicken. He doesn't just cluck a couple of times, he clucks non-stop through out the whole movie. He even flaps his arms like a chicken which is even stupider than anything I have ever seen. I couldn't believe this came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early '80's or something.|1
It´s all my fault . They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I´m a huge fan of the flick (and I´ll try and be honest, I´m still not in the mood to watch it :P) but this was the only movie they ever said I should avoid, which is why I’m currently reading “I Should” :). They did say that I should avoid the flick as it was a big hit and they didn´t mean that they meant it as a movie. However, I was told by a certain director that I should avoid.|0
"""Disappointing"" is the best word I could think for this film, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users.One thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial(in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focussing as it does on the US athletics team) but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the US team faced.What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?"|1
"I recently viewed a copy of this (under the title 'Eaten Alive') Talk about dreadful! Any movie Ed Wood ever put out looks like Oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. To be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as ""These people (Cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me"" Classic! The mad 'Jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really did look like a nutter."|1
After an undercover mission in Bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers, the agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect the Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of an accountant of the Romanian Mafia. However, the CIA safe house is broken in by the criminals, and Sonni realizes that the information was leaked from inside the Agency. Alone, trusting only in his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni fights to survive and protect Nadia.The career of Wesley Snipes is downhill.|1
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable, aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luscious Betty Chandler), loopy Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross), paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin), gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee), and nutty old hag Mrs. Callingham (the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams).|1
I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan it is now my pleasure to share with you all the amazing news that will be a part of this adaptation, which will hopefully be very useful and interesting for other fans. I don’t know who I would have done a little bit of adaptation with, but it is pretty amazing to see the world of Jane Austen being adapted by a huge amount of people, and to see this adaptation take shape.|0
This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.I can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a SF one.For example: 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly.2. You can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie. (believe me, it's my domain)3. With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy. Let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron.4.|1
I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know , those hip , jazz club clubs. But my friend and i don't really know the reason why you can't see it in the movie ( I know you want to go see it in the movie). And if I'm not mistaken, the movie in the picture is supposed to be about hip-hop and not jazz -- I think it should have been about hip-hop and not jazz. But you don't really know the details of it because the movies are supposed to show it for you to see and to understand.|0
John Knowles modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, are one of many subtle, and subtly is the watch word, themes of love, hate, jealously, denial and regret. The 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is - A love story with war looming in the background. The 2004 version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story. What is staring you in the face when you read the novel - is a love story, and yes maybe it is arguable, a gay love story.|1
I could n't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a day after I was at work. This is a great movie for those of me who are looking for inspiration or to get some inspiration from some of the older movies on DVD or Blu-ray. I am sure that it can be used to make life a bit easier and more interesting for everyone. If I had to look into the future, I'm sure this could make more of an impact than just the old. I hope this movie can give you inspiration.|0
I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like his singing too. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among commoners. Now when he ventured to become an actor  that was a big joke! What guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. I did never want to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becoming a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor has raked box office collection of 14 crores  compared to Apne that has collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks.|1
"""The death of a performer at a Broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo. The dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a prime suspect in this death, and some other murders that occur at the theatre. 'The Phantom Killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim; so, it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.Milton Raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit."|1
Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other?Contrary to what others say, there IS an element of suspense here: The idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their awfulness on some other, undeserving mate.It's funny reading comments here about how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this film, because Montgomery's role is as much of a heel.|1
"This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out.Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the ""wrong side of the tracks"" in '40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother."|1
"Okay , . so I went into this loving RuPaul . I still love him/her but think a little less of him/her . so I'll try it for a while so I can see what is going on. ""As I've said on the record, I've never done it. It's actually been my favorite song ever, and to this day, I do feel like I've made it through this whole process."" I don't know where this is going but I think it would be an improvement if RuPaul made something that wasn't his."|0
The genius that is Stephen Sondheim was never more prominently displayed as it was in his 1979 `` Musical Thriller » series in which he became one of the first to speak about the need for an independent film about him. On that fateful night of July 5, 1999, a few months before the release of the new book in the second issue, it was still early for Sondheim to be interviewed by writer/director Robert Altman and, as if he hadn't had any luck at all, he wasn't the first actor to say anything about what he thought the movie should be about.|0
`` Lackawanna Blues'is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban Blacks during the 50s and early 60s . A group of eight people were killed, and five were injured by police and paramedics in the attack on the jazz club on May 8. Blues had been trying to bring peace to the region in the 1960s, but the Blues were losing it. It took a long time to put a stop to the chaos. By 1970, there was a total lack of funds. By the mid 70s, it was estimated that the Blues would lose $60 million in its last decade.|0
Though I have watched Salò , I do not know if excrement tastes tart . If it does , this is likely the reason why Salò taste good on me . And if it tastes not tart, then it is probably not . Salò taste good so if it tastes not tart, it is likely it tastes not tart . But there is another theory, that the sweetness of Salò may come from a chemical process and it is very likely that . That’s my theory, but it does not have any practical application . Salò is made of sugar and sucrose.|0
I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night. Frankly, I have never heard about this movie before. Simply, I lost track of Seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one. Here, again we have a dull Seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully. The plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart. I simply don't have any idea why Seagal did this movie.|1
A 1957 Roger Corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley in New York, California. It is hard not to notice. This book was the first one I wrote for young readers, and a book that really was. It is also a story about the world around us. If you haven’t read it before, it will probably be the first time you will have. This was an epic that took place in the 19th Century. It was written for young readers, with the aim to be great, but not exactly the way that you expected.|0
"I have always liked the Carry On films , with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy. I don't remember why I watched the one where they said, ""Oh, I want to get married! It's just because you are too fat"". This film is much better than I remember it, and I have not watched this one in awhile, and it's a bit of a draw. Carry On was my first time in a film that I haven't watched, it was my first time seeing the film and I enjoyed it as I watched it."|0
... and in this series , I 've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle . Remember this , because I was the one who thought it a funny way for a guy to use the hairstyle . I always feel that it doesn't fit the style of a particular style, and I feel like there should be something in between . So , when I saw this video , I thought it would be a good thing to change my style , but it turns out that I'm a good guy too . This is the first time I feel like I have an issue with the style.|0
"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW . At least Ed Wood 's misguided attempt at making a point that was not addressed in The Dune of harrrow 's novel. But the fact that the novel has been translated into English has nothing to do with the fact that it is intended to be the ""Dune of Harrrow."" And this is especially true in an era where many books are available to people of limited means (e.g., the paperback version of Harrrow 's classic work, The Dark Tower of Babel) but that doesn't mean that it won't work well as a book for all readers."|0
No doubt that the indie flick Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I 've seen in a long time. And yes, it is even better than its predecessor. But when the film opens, it doesn't seem like you'll have more than enough room to take the movie. For that reason, I'll give it to you. I'll give Eddie the option of going to a local movie theater, where you get to watch whatever you want and see if they give you tickets to a movie night or something.|0
This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a B-Movie. The script is awful, it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither. First there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic, uninspired Vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... How more can you pander to your audience?... That prison time is boring, unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep.|1
I 'm glad they finally released it on DVD . I bought the video tape years ago and watch it every morning and I'm happy for it. I just don't know what I was watching before I did it but now I've seen it in my head and if I just watch it after a long break, I'll take a break. I've been waiting for one of my best friends to take my picture on DVD but they're getting impatient, so I'll just put it on my wall and watch it .|0
As talk-shows go , Larry King Live is not bad , and since he occasionally gets good guests , it’s probably his fault he was not the most popular one in the audience , because it was not a fun evening but he is the best host of the show. However, as you may know, Larry King was a guest on The Late Show Live and you have to wonder whether he was very good as host , for that matter, for all those who were on his show . He did well , and it’s hard for me to imagine what the fans would think about him .|0
Breathtaking at it 's best , intriguing at it 's worst , Francis Ford Coppala 's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' show. And then, he did it again — and again — and again and again and again, all over the world. There has never been a more beautiful place to stand in than it has to be this year, and even more amazing than ever, in terms of its beauty. There is such beauty everywhere — in everything, even when it is very, very special — that there has never been room for any sort of visual art.|0
A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan. What could be worse than Hogan in the movies? Bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, as Tiny Lester made his way to the WWE that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders. See the dictionary under Oops. As a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when I came out I immediately checked into H.A. - Hulkamaniacs Annoynimous. I am proud to say I have been off the Hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since.|1
Great 1980s Comic Strip comedy set in the South West of England. It is a tale of sex, drugs, cream teas and murder by the seaside. Adrian Edmondson, French and Saunders, Nigel Planer (hilarious in drag) and Robbie Coltrane play a part. Dennis (Edmondson) tries to impress girlfriend by boasting he is involved in a multi-million pounds drug deal. This leads to complications with hilarious results. I am trying to find out the original picture ratio for this film but it does not appear under 'Technical Aspects' of the IMDb site.|1

I would like to know if `` The Outsiders '' ( Australian TV series ) will ever be released on the UK box-office list. Is the series available for the first time to the US? Does the series have to be released later this year or will it be released only on Australia? I've been watching the Australian series for about a month and a half. I have seen the show on TV and it has been great. I haven't watched it on Netflix yet, and it has been a big disappointment. Can the Australian series get released for the US?|0
This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. Besides, HOW do you resist the title?For late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them into English, then made a mint with them at the drive in.|1
"""Love Life"" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene."|1
Unreal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers , you can expect to find many new and improved versions of this article. Reviews are a very important part of any web page. If you review a book in review mode it is very important to give your reader a good idea on what you are looking for so that you can be sure that the review comes from your ideal author. One of the easiest things to remember is what is being reviewed in terms of book reviews, and how much the book reviews are on review day.|0
By the time the Hellraiser franchise was reaching it 's forth film the premise was wearing a bit thin . . . I don't like the idea that we're being called 'heroes' but we could just call them heroes . . . . But I don't see what this is . . . . I don't even really care about how many people think we do . . .

A satire about greed and money , what ? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than I've ever found out in my entire life I've known, so let me share this with you, because if you don't like what I saw , please just drop me a PM or so. I think this is the biggest scandal to come out on the Internet. They are having a hard time convincing everyone who is paying for this, to stop making money. I have tried and tried to help them and they are still not working well.|0
There were only two redeeming features about this movie ; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture , and the way it was shot . As the film progressed, we discovered more about the movie and how it had been made. The movie is very interesting as well as a good example of a story , but not as a masterpiece . In Bucharest, the hero has to do everything to stay alive in the fight with his wife, his sons, and his son's wife . For this reason, the film is made very well.|0
Badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. It doesn't really get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. Occasional good one-liners.David is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an IQ below sea level.|1
I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap. This anti-Bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original Batman done by Michael Moore. Political satire should be clever, this however, pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an L. Ron Hubbard film.In its campy, inane way, it accuses the Republicans of stealing elections, going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder. It even takes a swipe at the Second Amendment and religion.|1
"They call this film ""euro trash horror"". Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it's ""euro"". Trash? Ah yes, it's trash all right.You know you're in for a great movie when, right at the beginning, the DVD gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch. Expect crackles, odd jarring cuts, and for the movie not to fit the screen. Plus there's the sound -- at first I thought I was watching a dubbed film."|1

There is one adjective that describes everything about this film - acting, plot, effects, continuity, etc. - and that word is poor. The government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something-or-other (looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face) wreaks havoc around the accident scene, which includes a favorite place for the window-fogging, partying set. Therefore, some young people - as well as a law enforcement officer - are among the creature's victims.|1
I was once a big Olsen fan . I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost immediately, but after I watched a couple of times, I didn’t watch any more, and then later decided I was bored. I finally saw this movie in 2014 and I was obsessed. I watched it again in January 2016, and I also watched another movie this year. This time, I didn’t see it again. I just saw it on my phone. I was not a fan, but in some ways, it had a lot of heart.|0
This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in a while . The acting was just soooo bad . The movie was just terrible . And the story is so lame , that it looks terrible .

You know , and the story is so lame , that it looks terrible . I think you're right . But the story , and the acting . .|0
"If you're tired by the same repetitive, unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases, you'll enjoy ""You Are Alone"". It is thought provoking, well shot and riveting.Without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie, this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.Through their discussion, you explore two shifting views of prostitution, depression, loneliness."|1
This movie was much better than I expected . ++++ Jean Peters actually does a passable job as a pirate and he's very well-read . . . This is a really interesting film and I think this was a pretty good story. He was a bit of a duffer. It's not all good for a story, though. This is really good. If there's more than one, I think this is the film that best summarizes my thoughts. I don't understand what the title means, but I do understand that if we get it right this movie is just a bit better.|0
Until today , I thought there only three people , including me , who considered Heaven 's Gate ( 1980 ) , the place of all the Gods, who are here. Now I thought about it, 'God is here,' and 'the Gate is the way, the Way of the World' and all that's here. And I'm really confused because I can't remember any of that. This is so weird I almost forgot the word. I can't recall why I think I should ask the question I just asked.|0
Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful! !This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name, or no name. Well, to be fair, I guess most Canadian movies give Canadian Cinema a bad name.Next to the characters (there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history), the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie. It's like a drunken snail making its way to die.Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at. She's the only thing that kept me watching.|1
"Most people will consider that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in, from comic, to tragic, from eager to learn to dominating to hateful. It also showed him to advantage as a ""talk singer"" and a dancer. Finally, as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway, the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I."|1
I found West Point to be an agreeable film , although I doubt that I would watch it again . I also watched a few other films in it and thought I'd enjoy watching the movie. The story is pretty simple, as you can imagine! There is a small town in the area that has a small bar in the middle of a street (there are about 5 in there) so that if you go outside for a drink, there are a few bars around the bar that can be a great idea to try.|0
This movie made me so angry ! ! Here I am thinking that here 's a new horror movie , and I want to make this movie with the same kind of feelings. So, if you want to read a new horror movie or something with a similar themes , then here is a movie that you can watch that's made for you. The movie is really a very good movie , but you can just see it if you look at what you want to see when you look at it , and you have no idea what the meaning of the movies is.|0
I saw this film many years ago, and absolutely hated it -- I could not wait for it to end, and would have walked out, but there was a girl sleeping on my shoulder. You know what? I have never forgotten this film, and more, I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music over the years. How many movies have I wept over and laughed over in the moviehouse, then forgotten as soon as I hit the street, like ... you see, I can't even think of one!|1
This movie totally sucked!!! Don't even rent it! You'll hate it! The plot didn't make sense, the characters sucked, and why was that penguin trying to get the pebble anyway? If that girl penguin would only like him because he has a pretty pebble than the relationship would not be based on love only on money! I very much disliked this movie(Hate is such a strong word!). And penguins cant fly! Even if they believe than they can do it, they cant. p.s. I am not who you think I am!|1
Got this the other day from the Creators on DVD. I saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst family were stopping in a hotel, had never heard anything about it. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie beach i just had to buy it. I used to take the kids to the dunes in the film all the time whilst living in Aberdeen.1st off Im not a big Sci-Fi fan (baring Star Wars) I was really just wanting to see what they had done with this film location, I was presently surprised.|1
An enjoyable movie, without a doubt, and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boy's 'rites of passage'. But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here, I was a bit disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays. The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns, but a philanderer, is risible. And without that, nada.|1
An obvious cash-in on the *Insert Monster Here* On A Plane gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you'd expect it to be. The film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. Although, it is fun in parts, I must say. The Zombie-action is particularly entertaining. Once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid.The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. The ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel.|1
This movie will not be considered for an academy award, but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment. You'll enjoy a send up of Darth Vader for the villain (the breather), a female Batman for the heroine (but much cuter with much less costume), and a running joke that involves cigarettes and the police captain that's very funny. Not by any means a great cinematic achievement. But if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing.|1
Even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries, odds are you will find this one fascinating. Not only does it have a well-mapped out plot that while easy to follow, contains its interesting detours; it also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that relies on a simple specific tone. Instead the emotions here are as profound and turbulent as the seas featured.That being said, if you know nothing of Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 single-handers boat race around the world...as was the case for me...please stop reading, and rent/view this film.|1
Alain Resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a sort of Operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only his attempt misses it's only real target, the woman that he pines after. In the same unfinished château he built, a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story, as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group.|1
What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. While the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. The characters are cutouts from the inner city version of The Breakfast Club or even The Faculty. Watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. With them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems.|1
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. Unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. This film only concerns itself with the period within New York City, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a fair amount of time in NYC at that time, I can assure you that there was a gay life outside Manhattan!|1
2005 will go down in 'Dr.Who ' history as its most incredible year . Everything seemed to click ; a lot more than I could care to think about. But then, I get a little bit of it . I'm a bit of a little bit of a fool for saying that I'm a fool for believing that I'm not , but I just can't. I'm just as much of a fool as being a fool for believing I'm a fool for thinking I'm a fool for thinking that I am, but not believing.|0
"Fun With Dick and Jane failed to entertain on so many levels . There were loose ends with the writing of this article, many of which are still open to debate

You have no idea how much you want Dick and Jane to be successful. They were the first two people in the UK to have the opportunity to write about The Hunger Games, and it was a hard decision at first. It was also a difficult time. They were a tough sell and it was painful for them. I’ll just say: Dick and Jane are the only two that have reached the level that you’re after."|0
When I first saw this movie in the theater I was so angry . It completely blew in my opinion that it was an entirely different movie. And I loved the movie so much I actually put it on hold to watch it for about an hour. This movie is great and if you are ever in a theater in your life and watch it you will love it. I mean, you do get to see all of these movies and not just the actors. It also works because it is so popular with people so you don’t get bored of it and it is great.|0
"(Spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it at a Blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely NO description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that, I had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing it with ""Night of the Demons,"" but, you know, they're basically the same thing."|1
"The sort of `` little '' film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore .

I'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS...) Why, you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room, it's so large. And how 'bout the bay windows in the bow, the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the Admiral's stateroom with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub...OK, OK...it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity.|1
"What I hoped for (or even expected) was the well known ""stop motion"" imagery and extreme slow motions, extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes. In short: The art of a) finding interesting Visual Events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. The stuff that made the other Qatsi's hits.I just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.Having watched the movie I got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping."|1
This movie is very modern and forward. It is about 75% in English. It is aimed at English-speaking multiplex-going young audience. Basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average.Unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. The director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. All through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding.|1
Is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch ? Just what is she doing ? She’s trying to help her family in some way , she’s trying to tell her family that it is not all about her being a witch and that she wants them to love her no matter how much money she makes, she has to convince them to get married and that is how she does it , but she can’t really tell anyone the truth, so that she can tell them all what she’s trying to tell them .|0
"Why can't a movie be rated a zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies such as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" are so bad they're fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. ""The Dungeon of Horror"" might be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of anyway. I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but thankfully, I can't remember them."|1
Great acting, great production values, good direction.But the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. We're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.The conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. For instance, we're very clear that Rudyard Kipling is pro-war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.This is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books.|1
THE MERCHANT OF FOUR SEASONS was Rainer Werner Fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance. In a turbulent career of just fifteen years, he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater, both as a performer and a creative producer, actor, and director. Although this movie might not appeal to many viewers, the film has much to offer. The storyline is fairly straightforward. A man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems, and proves unable to control his downward spiral.|1
Stephen Sondheim 's SWEENEY TODD : THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with a sold-out crowd of about 400 people. A few years earlier he had won a gold medal in the PGA Tour, and was awarded a bronze by New York Magazine as the winner of a World Golf Champion at the New World Golf Championships, the world’s only golf tour by a woman. This year it will be an honor to win the gold, and will also be a big honor for the winner to be the first woman to win a Tour de France.|0
The subject matter was good , direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major . The role also had to be taken from another Major as well. He had to play a very unique role and played well for a while, but he did not play as much as was needed in the role. The only thing he did not do, in terms of strategy, to get the ball out was to take the ball to the back end. Mohanlal had to learn that a great deal more than you'd get from a man with an ounce of speed.|0
This movie twists the facts of Anne and Mary 's lives into something unrecognizable . To make Mary Boleyn , who had been the most famous woman in the history of American society, the story of Anne Boleyn (1910-1984). Boleyn became her life's most famous woman, having been one of the most powerful men and women on Earth. This is because she had always believed that Mary would never be able to escape death. She was not prepared for a life of obscurity and danger . This is the story of Anne Boleyn. It's her story to tell you.|0
I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning Brit sex comedy. I guess I should have read the finer print. I rarely write a panning review, but here goes.These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.I repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick?|1
From the portrayals of Andy Warhol in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquiat, this is the type of movie I would predict Andy Warhol might make--airy, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The movie's (almost non-existent) plot which is sometimes increduously unbelievable is offset by the movie's rough, real-looking cinematography. The film has a way of being unreal, yet dictating reality to the viewer. The only worthwhile part of the movie is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly and every thing in it should be viewed as a characterization device.|1
One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card.|1
"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film-making is that you either make a masterpiece , or a lemon :-(

It's an interesting question: Is a movie a film? If it's a film, as the title suggests, is there a rule that says it's a ""film"" ? Or, if it's a movie (or a documentary), can it also be a ""films"" ? And, if you think it's a film, are there other films, movies that make sense in your mind?"|0
This movie sucks so bad . Its funny to see what a poor story this has , where two pea-brained women who have no idea how to be successful in life get into this movie, as it's supposed to be a little bit. They have to figure out the right way to put together a good story and then decide for themselves who's the good guy to make it all work together in the movie. But i have to agree with them, i don't know why the movie is better than any other.|0
"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! ""The Beginning"" was not the greatest either but better than this one. This is not a good way to lead up to the original movie. It's just simply awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake looking in both movies! Why not use real animals? I enjoyed the old Sinbad movies better than this. I was royally disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well. I understand why this movie was redone as ""The Beginning""."|1
`` What Alice Found '' is the greatest movie that nobody 's ever heard of ! I underestimated it when I heard it. I didn't even know how to watch a film. I don't watch movies or television or anything because I haven't watched the series. I don't think that the series is the greatest any one of the last two. If you find a movie and you like it, that's one of those things that you can easily do, especially if you know exactly what the film is like, because most of what you can find from it is not the same.|0
If anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. This film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. I wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy. It is a low budget movie with amateur actors. It looks like it was filmed for a film contest. The acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a Hee Haw script writer. My family laughed at it. A Grade ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way.|1
"In my opinion, the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing. The initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever. People started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. People went nutty, demons were possessing people, all kinds of fun. Of course then it all went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of writings to find the ""third testament"" in five days, but then at the end it became this ridiculous humanist fantasy."|1
I 'm an action movie fan but until today I 've never seen a preview or an ad for this game. I haven't, but as I've never played it before, I'm sure I'll find a few new ones I have a couple of months to try out, I hope. I 'm very interested in hearing more about the game this year. The last time it was announced I didn't have the budget for it so I haven't yet seen the preview. I've also only seen it for four hours and nothing new was released.|0
This was a great movie. Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child. The performances by S Eptath was outstanding. Mos Def and his singing was off the hook. Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there. But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching. All the different stories they had was amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence.|1
This was it ! i would have never expected the ending if i did n't already know the behind the scenes of how they ended up, thanks ! ive seen all that happened before, and have not even been in touch with them since ive been so scared, i don't even know what to do :(. Thanks again!!!!!!! I've been trying to find a link to a few things, but I'm really looking for other things that might be related. First off, you might wanna look at a screenshot of this for the rest of the weekend.|0
I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie . You people encouraged him to go, but when he saw how the movie made the story more believable, he turned to the movie, and said he was too tired of the story, and that it made him feel sick to have a character who was too weak for the big screen. I've seen a few of his movies before, and he's not a bad guy, especially one that has a lot of time for the big screen.|0
"When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island,they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor(Richard Johnson of ""Zombi 2"" fame),a mad scientist(Joseph Cotten),his beautiful daughter(Barbara Bach)and a horde of superstitious natives.The tribesmen say that the doctor has created grotesque half-human,half-fish creatures for evil,secretive purposes.And though at first the prisoners do not believe this,as they disappear,one by one,they begin to change their minds."|1
"I really love this movie. It has a very real feel to it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.This is an ""A"" movie and I recommend it highly. If you liked ""1984"" book or movie, I think you will like this one as well.This is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. Not for the week at heart or stomach."|1
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked this one even more than X-men. In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is just not an emotionless super hero. Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies.|1
Seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name `` employee of the month '' might ring bells with some people. I am sure it won't work out for some of you but I don't think it's that important. That's what I think of it for. The only person I've ever known I've tried to hire as an employee was a company executive and I've worked as a human resources person for almost a decade now. I've had numerous opportunities to work for a company for a decade but I never had the opportunity to hire them myself.|0
This film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the Kennedy assassination. The film would be the best thing I've seen, the best that we've had. I watched it last night, I watched it at night, and it's been amazing. I watched the assassination as an ordinary citizen, not just in New York and New York City. I watched the assassination of JFK as he was being tried in the United States District Court of the District of Columbia.|0
Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film . His dialogue was captivating, with a wide range of voices and moods in and out of character. His direction and direction were well researched, and he created a well crafted screenplay that could not be denied. I enjoyed his film but the final scenes I enjoyed. I liked his film a lot because it presented the same vision and feel as the original movie. The pacing and execution were good, but he made no bones about it. He made no compromises in the pace of his work.|0
I was hoping that Pulp would be a interesting movie , but was profoundly disappointed.Pulp has very little storyline , so I thought the story was a lot better. The film was a little dull, so I felt it would have been better if Pulp was more of a plot device. However Pulp did have a sense of adventure and I was hoping it would be a bit more adventure story, but then again this would probably be more interesting. But I was thinking it was a bit more suspenseful, more action , less plot but I was hoping that the ending was less suspenseful.|0
A great film . Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew . The actors give credible performances all the time . The directors are capable to convey all your needs and desires . The performance is very good . As you are going to feel a lot of tension , one of the most important things in a film is to do it with the right kind of person. In the beginning, the actors are very helpful . As we are going to discuss . In this brief chapter, you will discover a lot that you will not get in the story . As we discussed .|0
This is an excellent film , but Momento ( Nolan 's other big budget film ) is much better . . . . and if this were a 3D game you'd want to spend more than 2 hours on a game. The only reason you see this film is because, as far as the 3D animation goes, it was a great way to go in 3D. I'd love to see more 3d games in this one. It is one of the best I have ever seen. If only they could change the rules for a movie, I'd buy it .|0
Before you watch this movie - clean your ears, take away the make-up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She doesn't have to. This picture will give you both warmth enough to keep your relationship life-long enough. If you're Jew/Russian/Ukrainian/immigrant - yes, what popular-movie-minority so ever - laugh within your memories. If you're something else or whatever your are anyway - laugh for the bittersweet memory of importance of friendship and family. It this movie, nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem.|1
I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out . It did n't bother me that I was in a bad place at that time. My friend and I used to play a lot of those games on the way back to school, but I'd gotten used to it a lot. So I bought one of those old-timers and made some of the older games with the help of two of my favorite players. It's not really a movie, but I do like to see the stories that get told to young kids.|0
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The plot revolves around a man named Mr. Shrimp who goes out for dinner and ends up getting drunk, and he gets the best of everything. The movie does a good job with the dialogue, but it isn't great as the movie ends and the film is a bad movie. The movie does a great job in showing the movie as a bad film, but it does not work so well that I have to re-edit the script. It would be better if the plot was the best of the worst !|0
You know , before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases . I had a great experience with a large number of people in this country and it is no surprise that this film was such a hit. The film was also a great experience to watch , as we have a lot of stories to share here . It made me a lot more relaxed and professional than I've ever been , with a big heart for people who are in the criminal arena as well as their families . One thing I've learned here is that watching is not something you take for granted .|0
"Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen , clearly inspired by Rock Hudson 's stage plays. There is no hint of sound. There isn't, however, a music video for the soundtracks , except for one single song . ""If"" is his first collaboration with an audience member. The second one is the title track in the second half of the play. This production is inspired by his earlier work for the stage, ""When You Were Young"" and ""How Long You Can Keep On Going"" (1942) directed by Thomas W. Puckett."|0
Mickey Rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays Martin Fallon an IRA terrorist who accidentally blows up an IRA checkpoint. The plot starts when an IRA terrorist in Las Vegas gets arrested for an attempted murder. The terrorist is charged with murder and has to be taken into custody. When the terrorist is apprehended he escapes and the plot goes wrong. The plot is successful, however, and the terrorist is later taken back to Las Vegas. The movie has been criticized for its depiction of a plot to use a private jet as a hostage.|0
Well, this is new...Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci shoots a film about a famous Italian horror director called...Lucio Fulci. After years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences, it becomes hard for Lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders. He quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom. Even the dedicated psychiatrist can't seem to keep Fulci on the right track... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value, Cat in the Brain certainly is one of Fulci's most pleasant films.|1
This is easily one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long long time ( and I 've seen a long time anyway ) I hope you'll like it !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There's no way this one can make it through in a day or more !!! !!!! I think it's pretty close !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!!! !!!!|0
I do n't really know why so many persons love this movie : maybe it 's funny , OK , i just hope its true ? : i was just wondering whether it was funny for you to say something funny like i have such a lot of knowledge , why would you not like to watch the movie ? but i want to watch it with my kids , this is my life , when i was a kid i didn't understand , it was funny too , but now its the same again ? It was hilarious and funny but i was not expecting to see a movie that is more than that!|0
"There is a difference between a ""film,"" and a ""movie."" A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer, I have seen may examples of both.On September 19, I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski's ""Donnybrook."" Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the ""finished"" product) of this piece, I can safely say it is a movie."|1
I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all of the performances are strong. I especially enjoyed the way the role of Emily, a mentally challenged savant, was handled. Despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without cliché by the actress, Taylor Roberts. Also a standout was Fran Kranz, whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors. Although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script.|1
Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT ( 1955 ) : the first half is deadly dull , even dreary - it’s time for a fresh start, if we’ve been living with it. The last half of the first half is a great one, as we all know how important it gets. But I’m not going to spoil it for you if you ask my opinion, so let’s go with a little more of what you have to offer. What does it look like in terms of gameplay? Well it is very simple.|0
"I used to think that it couldn't get worse that ""Army of the Dead"" but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like ""The Godfather""!! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes the acting, put it this way, I went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an Oscar worthy performance, when compared to these D-List (and that's being kind about it) actors and actresses."|1
Yes , maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that does n't take away from the fact that there is nothing like this in many, many modern film productions. It should be clear from what has been stated that the most important elements in the film are a film that was designed to shock audiences and that was filmed under the radar of many people who were not involved in the production. I think the film was well received and as a result the film was reviewed by many critics. For me, it was one of the best features of the entire film.|0
Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and despite the mostly negative responses I've heard to it, and the suspiciously tardy DVD release, I couldn't help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage, because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne, and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit.|1
Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema . ( 1 ) Your average person could watch the most popular movies but only one was good . . . and if the film had been better then I would have thought I was in love with the movie ( 2 ) Now I know this is completely subjective , it’s all too easy to find movies with bad reviews. So I’ll be honest, I don’t do a lot of reviews. They aren’t good. So I’ll just tell you some good movies I’ve found.|0
A wasted effort . On the surface it 's a typical disaster movie : we 're involved in the lives of people that have lost a loved one . But then we 're going to get killed . I don ' t want my wife to have a good life . But she has to have a good life as well . What do we do about it and how do we get her to give up her good life in order to be with us, and to see the world for the sake of our family and our community . How do we keep the family going and keep her healthy and the community going?|0
This film proves a theory I have had for quite some time - in Australia, as long as a film deals with the right topic, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. Aussie Park Boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor Warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in twenty-first century Sydney! The last time any Irish gangs were in Australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!)|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance, but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom.|1
The core issues at play ( God & Satan / Good & Evil ) can be & should be tremendously complicated. But it is just that this is a common enough scenario that we need to discuss here, so let us try to take a few simple suggestions from there. For one, we don’t need to know a lot about who or where the Satan is or who he’s leading us to think we should be fighting against. This has to be something we’ll start with. We aren’t a lot of good fighters, but we have some interesting things to learn.|0
This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house that it is based on as well as the person. As you see at the end of themovie, she was killed in the world trade center incident. I know that, because I was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains. (She was the only one in our area lost). The nudity in the movie went a bit far. I am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing.|1
"""Tragic Hero"" is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty, and revenge. Also, this is part of a two part series as The Godfather also was (at the time). However, this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other Triad thrillers being released in Hong Kong at the time.One reason is the acting. With the exception of Chow Yun Fat, the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable."|1
I ca n't quite explain why I find this so alluring and `` The Leopard '' not ; it may be a little weird that you need to think about it first and then you're done with the world, or perhaps it's just because you wanted to be that way, but there's nothing to do. It's true that we can do it if we want; we know that it'll always be different from what it was, but we have to learn to work with it. We can't have it, you understand, because it's a way to learn.|0
. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice , bouncy jugs. . . and I have always said to my friends and family that if we are looking for a woman who loves me, it's not enough that I will look for a nice woman who doesn't. But if we are looking for someone who would love me, then I will just look for the right woman, and they would find one who would love me, and not only will I find someone who wouldn't. . .|0
"Awful, awful, awful times a hundred still doesn't begin to describe how crappy ""Biggest Loser"" is. Picture this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on prime time television. Am I the only one who thinks that this isn't something people with IQs in the 3-digit area WANT TO WATCH? Everything drags on forever, with the lumps of lard whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care?"|1
I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie. There's a lot of famous Rome monuments and historical locations.It is from the same writer and director from The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks stars along with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The movie starts out with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the canisters is stolen by the church's most hated enemy the Illuminati. The plot is hard to discuss about without spoiling anything. Its a race all of Rome following the Illuminati trail to get to the Illuminati secret meeting place.|1
I watched this film not knowing anything about it . I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of a certain type, so I don’t know whether I am being completely wrong, or if they really did a thing to me. In that video it is the same story of a man who was able to cut down his wife and son and run from him in a remote area of the country. I watched it for a while and when I finished it I realized I needed to see it again. And that is exactly what I did as I watched it.|0
Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web . This one is a good portrayal of the modern and modern time, and also the main reason that the video has become the main part of the entire movie. It was used for the entire movie with the help of my friends who have been to the movies in this series for the last few times . So, I had a great time playing this one with my friends. It's very enjoyable and entertaining and the movie itself was well written.|0
"I was hoping to like this movie , to settle in for an evening of goofy fun . I like what they have to say about their movie :D

If you know any other movies, you might know that I've seen it, as well. If you don't, you're just not likely to like it. And if you do, you don't need to watch it again! If you're not already in love, then I recommend buying it first and seeing if there is even a chance to get it again."|0
A very good film , focusing on a very important issue . Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect, the birth defect being the one that is not controlled by any treatment or drug . The father of the girl , a middle-aged grandmother , was born to an alcoholics family and has never been treated in any way with alcohol . This is very shocking , I was very sad to read it , and I was very surprised to learn that she is from a different dimension . This is a great story and a very important one . . . .|0
This movie was bad on so many levels. The writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable. It's a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie. I mean if anyone has seen any of the Police Academy movies, you would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His Character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from Characters i have seen him play before, so that was a plus. And I did think that Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie.|1

Ca n't liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004 because they thought Hillary Clinton would lose in the next election. It wasn't so much that it was the voters who felt it had taken a terrible turn. There was even a good chance the Clintons would win. And it's easy when you think of it—I'm the only politician I can think of who can really change the complexion of a presidential race, if only because the voters are not afraid to do so, and that's the way in which Clinton and her supporters have been for decades.|0
Max Cash a charter boat captain who works off the Caribbean island San Sebastian is hired by Sarah , who is the widow of the ex-colleagues' boss. The boat is set to sail to the Caribbean Sea, and you'll want to buy tickets. You need to be a member to board and be paid a minimum of 20 Euros. You will then be assigned to a captain who will ship off from San Sebastian. This will give you a chance to earn your way to San Sebastian. Sarah is not a member of the crew, but she will give you your money in advance.|0
"Well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this. I heard something about this so I picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from John Fallon AKA Arrow in the Head! At that moment I thought ""Well if he likes it then I gotta like it!"" So I rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy)."|1
I lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! What possessed the filmmakers to do this? This is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. To fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall, her aid to burros, and, of course, her ten cats! Do not see this film. And have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they do not have a clue.|1
Now out of all the shark movies I've seen, this one takes the cake! The plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards. Antonio Sobato, Jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father. A megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well. The view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places.|1
I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the ever living crap out of me. When I found it, I watched it. I wish I hadn't. The movie wasn't scary.The plot revolves around an old woman running the castle. She feeds this horribly disfigured person in the cellar of a 12 century castle. She continuously beats the poor guy every day and feeds him. Well, that day, she dies. Then, a few months later, a family moves in. A father, a mother, and their blind daughter.|1
"My buddies and I spent the majority of a Saturday afternoon watching a selection of ""bad"" movies. Among the flicks we watched, the strongest contender (for quality bad-movie fare) was easily Jack-O. It's ludicrous that movies such as ""Gigli"", ""Glitter"" and ""You Got Served"" are listed in IMDBs bottom 100. While they're certainly bad movies, they don't belong in the bottom 100. They're robbing ""Jack-O"", and ""Keeper of Time"", etc, of the Bad Movie Greatness they so richly deserve.So what makes Jack-O so great (in bad movie terms)?"|1
"This ""film,"" and I use that term loosely, reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote, at eighteen months: ""P.U., stinky poopies!"" Like that joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature, or the very stupid. That said, there are a few bright spots. The effects, where the majority of the reputed $100 million went, are kinetic and convincing -- I mean, as convincing as those kind of kinetic CGI effects can be."|1
I think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because I'm telling you, its just awful. The acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of Doctor Who, the story is, well, there is no story. And they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again. And the werewolf? Its like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is that bad.|1
A Chicago couple , Dillon and Dougherty , are falsely accused of killing their daughter . People begin to wonder if their parents are involved in the crime and whether the police are doing anything about the crime. As we look at the real culprits in the city , they are all connected to the death of their daughter. They all happen to be teenagers who were born by their parents and are teenagers who are being falsely accused of murder. If a person can have an arrest made against them for murder or for the murder of a child the police will be involved to do something.|0
I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . I don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.He is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2/1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in GodHe regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do God. One has only to look at the language used in his postulations. Regarding Faith. This commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour. Just think about it.|1
"Heh...I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone it being available for rent! This flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the T&A and the cheap laughs. The story line crosses a bit of ""Texas Chainsaw massacre"" with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of ""Psycho"", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy!"|1
My grandad gave me this DVD . With friends like these . The front cover looked quite scary thought i am going to take it with my friends . This is the second picture in the DVD . In the picture you see the guy is wearing jeans , a black t-shirt with a blue stripe pattern . But he is still wearing the black shirt on top and on top and in the back i see a white shirt on the bottom and a black T-Shirt . . . The picture was taken in 2001 with the first DVD release in 2006 , this is how it turned out in the end .|0
This one 's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already in the works. We all know that it is a problem  and you should know what that means  but I'm just here to tell you what that means. It means that, in fact, that you're the one who got it wrong  and there's a whole lot of stuff out there to be found  with an enormous amount of work that, in my eyes, would be a bit of a waste. But that's the real problem.|0
One of Chaplin 's longest films up to that point , Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex portrait of the relationship between the character and her husband . It is a story of the life of a person, not of her husband. The story of the husband's life in a different light. This is a fascinating read for a couple that have yet to come together for the first time. I was writing this post as I was trying to write another post and I decided to go over some notes on a couple different characters in the movie.|0
Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film : I love Park Chan-Wook 's work, but the film is so cute. And I love it so much (or, as the film goes, I like it so much). So I am going to do it for you. First, I wanted to ask you for some tips on what to do. I think it's good to know what you're trying to do when you're in a theater, but it can get tedious. This is my approach.|0
"This show started out okay, but then it turned into a nightmare. The worst part about it was the contestants. Most of them were weirdos. They did stupid things for a living and they also did strange hobbies. In the second season, one guy said he that he talked to his pants. That is sick and repulsive. Also, no one cared about winning money. All they ever wanted to do was make alliances like it was ""Survivor"" or something. The men were always afraid that the women were going to team up together."|1
"WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started doing a movie when I was 10, I was pretty scared and didn't get much exposure to the film. What I have learned through the film is one thing: You can't stop until you get the next movie, you can never stop. If you try to stop then you'll get out. A:

No one has read any of this. It's a fairly old piece of software you've written."|0
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending, you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family.|1
I 've seen worse films . This is bad but at least does n't try to be good so it won 't make it go up . If anyone is looking for that, I would love for it to get better . If not, do you think you could have a look at it 's website . If it does, then do a google search . What does it have to 've seen so far , I can't remember . So, do a look at the site . If not, do a google search . If it 's found, what does it have to look for .|0
"Of course I am going to think it was a great movie. I recognized several people I didn't see during filming also. I was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette. I also changed this one scene. They had originally had it set to go into the rec yard and straighten out the inmate and turn him around and walk him out. The Director said ""It is taking to long, what would you do Gower."""|1
First , what is really great about this movie : - Ryan Reynolds , great acting ! There are very few films to choose from which are not suitable for people who are not at all interested in this film . I was actually kind of surprised by how well this movie would have made me like this even though I have no clue at what to say. The film was great, great acting and great directing. I have seen the film before, but not in this movie. This movie was not great. It seemed like it was just not going to be good.|0
"I feel terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch-pic was enchanting, marvelous, full of spirit and elegance, this one here is only - colored! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by ""playing"" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! She only sings one song - the title role of an Lehar-operetta, that is really funny!"|1
"You know, before seeing this film I had little sympathy for those caught up in criminal cases. I mean if they were arrested and charged, ""they must have been guilty"" I reasoned?I formed this opinion over some years. You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the more seedy areas of Sydney. He frequently complained that his policing efforts were wasted due to 'bleeding heart' lawyers and magistrates. He would ""bang the crooks up in the morning and they would be ""back on the street by noon""."|1
When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie to watch as well. However, I think it is worth mentioning that I saw a lot of bad films and it is hard to find bad films. As I was saying before, I was watching some bad movies a lot, and I am very happy with it. The main thing I thought was that this film should be good to watch. Because of this, I also thought that this movie was one of the most action packed and fun movies on TV.|0
Dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being ACTED OUT PUPPETS!!! Also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. Due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. No one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. This should be a crime and.... I cant believe you would ruin a book like that.|1
! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt to dust by one of the customers. He or she will go to the next store, and if the customers want to buy something from the store, he or she will have to go to them. So the store goes up and down, and the customers go up and down, and then in the middle of the store, there will be no more sales. This store doesn't sell anything. The customers want to buy from it as well.|0
This movie is simply bad. First of all the story is just weird and it's not good written. It leaves you with questions when you're finished. Sometimes that's OK, but not in this case.The acting is nothing to write home about. The adults does a OK job, but the kids, taken in consideration they are kids, does not a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was worst. Well, to be honest I'm not sure that was the lead role. Never quite figured who this movie was about.|1
Such pain! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea, but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. I wouldn't say this straight-to-video South African/Canadian/UK horror flick is awful, but its just too bland, predictable and there's just very little memorable about it. It's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. I tried watching it last night, but had to finish it during the morning, as I couldn't keep my eyes open.|1
"""Scientists at a remote lab experiment on (insert scaly creature here) and create out of control monsters. In the meantime a crack military team/the scientist's daughter/bank robbers find their way to the remote place and are menaced by the giant critters. One by one they're eaten, all during an ""exciting"" race to not be blown up by the forces who initially created the monsters..."" The sad thing is that this sounds like about a dozen movies which have appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel. I have to wonder just what is going on? Sure..."|1
"It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. This movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. The box lies, this is no ""erotic thriller"", hell during the film's 97 minute running time, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us one nipple! I thought it would pick up once William Burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. This movie fails in pretty much every way."|1
"I fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid. This movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this (""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" - 1941, and ""Heaven Can Wait"" - 1978). The only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. The closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment."|1
The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I have n't seen every film released, but because my question mark is not on screen. So what is the most common way to see this film in the UK and/or USA? If you haven't seen it, watch it on Netflix, and I'd like to know if it is actually a film or not. If it is, please provide some examples of how you would want to see it in your area, not the UK or USA. This is one of those areas where the answer is yes.|0
With the war not going well for the Soviet Union , Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the volunteers in his own campaigns. After the Soviet Union fell into civil war in 1979 , the Soviet Union suffered another defeat , the Soviet Union , suffered another defeat and the Soviet Union fell apart . In the Soviet Union, the USSR was still suffering from civil war and had to face a famine for its food resources . During the Soviet War, Soviet Union and the Soviet Union , the USSR suffered another defeat, the Soviet Union , lost , and another defeat of the USSR .|0
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film? it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it, it can't be that bad surely. firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real? secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the Blair witch project (yawn) and does so very poorly. so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a Simpson's Halloween special would be far scarier. but, if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice.|1
I was n't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a paper shop... I'm not really an author and no, I'm not sure that it should be an easy way to describe my novel, but if I was, I'm not sure I'd be interested in how to make my characters stand out. I'm not sure I'd make the characters stand out if I could do so without a story about a child who was a little out of shape.|0
"This rendition of ""Noah's Ark"" has set Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation back about 100 years. However, the production has it's bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in ""how not to make a movie""Where in the annals of Biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:""Ok, boys, let's saddle up."" ""It's too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night."""|1
i watched the longer version and could not take my eyes off the screen. 219 minutes passed and yet it seemed like only an hour had gone by. the characters were very believable and entertaining, and the photography was excellent. the story pulled me in and held my attention. i will definitely watch this again and again. this true story telling at it's best... not Hollywoods usual cheap thrills and skin deep glitz. i've seen a quite a lot of reviews on this movie. most seem to pan the film or give it faint praise.|1
"I used to think that it could n't get worse that `` Army of the Dead '' but this load is pretty bad... So my first thought was to get a better idea of what `` Army of the Dead `` looks like. (And maybe it can be improved on my first idea though, I don't know.) It looks like:

In a couple of minutes it turns into a `` army of the dead,'' and a `` army of soldiers.'' But that doesn't seem to make a difference."|0
This film is a work of pure class from start to finish, for a moment forget the famous 28 minute no dialog heist, forget that it's set in Paris and forget it's Noir. The film itself, the premise and the execution make this a pure gold experience.. it's sharp intelligent and thought through in great detail, just like the heist itself. It portrays real characters that are not only believable but whom you empathize with. It's a film that doesn't glamorize the notion of a robbery but shows it for what it is.. theft.|1
One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent.|1
"Altioklar: Master of the thieves. Watch some movie, steal some parts of them, write a script... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar watched ""Identity (2003)"", ""Saw (2004)"", a few series which is about crime, murder etc. then he said ""Eureka, eureka""(i have found it!) after that he wrote the script of the movie.You can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. It took only 10 minutes for me."|1
This film 's a big bore . It has a plenty of Predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. It's just one of the best films I've ever seen in the genre. There are lots of reasons to have a film that is as good, or as good, as this film is. I've been saying for years that if you look at this, you'll see that this is the perfect movie to get your head around the genre for the next few years . It has an interesting plot that's perfectly balanced.|0
Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made . Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time. There are many things you need to learn about cinema. First off, you have to understand the cinema in its own right. If I were to give you a recipe I would recommend the film ‘The Big Bang Theory’ , which I was given to watch. It is a film about the Big Bang. If you were given the recipe it would work great as it was a comedy of manners.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was 13 years old and I fell in love with it and I was a big fan of the film and the characters I adored. My favorite character was Stacey (Heidi Holicker), because she made me laugh when she showed no interest in Fred (Cameron Dye) who really liked her and I was hoping that in the end that they would get together then her boring boyfriend, Ralphie (Christopher Murray)because he ignored her and hung out with his friends. I love the cast and the story.|1
"Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. He doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. The problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.On this ""Turkish"" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely Hollywoodish to me), Altioklar is trying to be some sort of Tarantino."|1
"`` Down Periscope '' has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS . Since then , we've got a lot of cool stuff to get our hands on. We've got everything you need to get started.

This book was created to help you out. We've got all these books in VHS, but for a limited amount of time only."|0
"Although this movie ( and I use the term loosely ) was made in 1997 , we just watched it and then I said,

Oh, well , I said that. Well , it’s not an insult to them that I am so proud to be the man who made it, I just don’t understand what people are doing to make movies with the word in it. They just want the word to play out, it’s how they wanted to show it in the movie, not how it’s meant to be done."|0
In my opinion , the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing . The initial idea of having someone with me was that I’d be working with a very long term plan that required me to do that and then I would have to go with that plan for as long as I wanted to work with this person and so on. That is not a viable option, as it would take too much time before I was ready to do that, but it is something that we all know is going to happen in the future.|0
In short this movie was awful.I understand it 's a Disney movie , which are generally shallow movies with mediocre animation. In this one , I'm going to have a little bit of an inside joke , I'm going to show you a little bit of animation , what that is .It's a film about a man who was just a small boy, so he goes on a trip on the internet to meet with a girl from the city of San Diego .She is a little blonde and wears glasses , but in a normal manner .|0
1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-John Waters ) : Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny stuff. 5/18/2011 - 5 out of 5 ( Chris Stapleton ) : As I was reading through the book I decided I’d better read it, so I went and read it, I’ll tell you, and I found a great book on that, with a lot of great examples of the characters and some funny facts. 9/16/2009 - 4 out of 5 ( Paul Simon ) : I liked this but I was more impressed with Stapleton’s work.|0
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen. it is a tight slap on the face of some Indians who speak in English and were looking at the mirror. disgusting. the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north Indian plains. the message - the educated English-speaking Indian tried to save the poor beggars of India in all earnestness. it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own.as a love story its okay. the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics.|1
Allegedly the `` true story '' of Juana de Castilla , the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (Linda II)'' , was recorded. She had previously been suspected of abducting children in Spain. In the Spanish Inquisition she was canonized by Juan de Mesto de San Juan, the first Latin bishop of El Salvador. She wrote a book on the history of Spanish Inquisition and other non-sectarian works, her most recent book is The Inquisition: A History of Latin Inquisition (1845). She was a prominent figure in El Salvador, the city which became a Latin colony in 1603.|0
"Reba sucks. It sucks hard. It's about this awful country singer attempting comedy. They might as well call this show ""Generic"", because that's what it is. It's dumb and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck, and so does Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12 year old who got knocked up. You all suck, and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals."|1

Owen is jealous of Alicia. He likes hanging around with Bob. Now Owen hangs around with Bob AND Alicia. Bob and Owen have a secretary named Heather. Heather is very accident prone. She is also, if you haven't guessed it, is kind of lonely. She too hangs around with Bob and Alicia, and Owen.|1
I have to agree with the previous reviewer . Although the Kristin Erikson did a great job of playing the piano , we had some problems during the piano play with the piano. With the piano, it was the piano and the piano played the melody and the melody played the violin , but they couldn't play the guitar and it was too much for me to play. When the piano played the melody, it sounded a lot too much and the piano played the violin and it sounded weak , but they still could play the piano and the violin . It was really annoying .|0
Why are there no good reviews? Because this film is hysterically bad.Set in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the Japanese officers brown nose Jim Brown's character.This is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did. Stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. The sixties-seventies music may be the best thing about the film, maybe because it has nothing to do with the film.This is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun.|1
This is one great , sweeping , movie you will remember for a long time . It is about history , the people who brought history to life and the people who came back to life by making it better. This movie is a classic film , but I think you will see more movie at the end of the series. You will see a very very important film for you and you may be surprised to learn that there are more movies on DVD than there are DVD's . This movie is also one of the greatest films of all time for many fans, and it really is.|0
I must say , when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site , I figured it was a pretty bad investment. It is a good film, but I was going to try to get a new camera to make it look more authentic. I really would not buy it again unless I had to pay some extra to have the film taken. I had to watch the film for a week, I was really nervous but I thought, this film was very good , and I was going to keep it up for awhile when I got home.|0
Not really worth a review , but I suppose it 's my duty to warn you all - especially since I am not at all good at telling jokes. I know that I'm never gonna make the same mistake as you so I am just waiting to say it out loud, which means I'm gonna be in a bit of a shit storm. I'm just here to warn you all - and as always - I am NOT good at what I do - and you won't be happy with me for it.|0
ExCUSE me , but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o ' poop . . . . I don't remember why . . . but I know that I don't care if it was because it was . . . . But it was . . . . Well, I guess I do. So I was really sad . . . . I wasn't happy . . . . But I'm sorry . . . . . I'll do it again . . . . . I'd rather that I didn't see this . .|0
"Televised in 1982, from a Los Angeles production, this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter. Issued on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer, it is quite stunning. Hearn and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated. Of course it is Sondheim's music and lyrics that make this possible. If anyone doubts that he is one of the ""greats"" of the American Musical form listen to this."|1
I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story, the great acting and the talented directing. I found it hard to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful performances by Vario, (Uncle Benny), Sara, (Jessica Tsunis), and Morris, (Eddie Monroe). The supporting cast was chock full of colorful and amusing characters. This film reminds me of one of those movies that you will look back on in 20 years and discover that it launched many actors into stardom.|1
This is the third movie in a month I have watched that did not go the way I expected . . . it seems like the only way to find out if there is an alternate answer to the questions in my question is to look at the movies themselves, watch them over and over again. I think it is clear that this is a way to find a way to tell the questions in the movie, and to ask questions for the answer. My friend and I have been thinking for a couple of months now, and still have not really gotten over the initial excitement of seeing the movies again.|0
The worst movie I have ever seen . The sound quality was bad , the cutting of the scenes was horrible and the ending was horrible. I am not looking forward to what the end may become like , I think I will see it eventually. You don't need to watch a movie if you don't want to and you want to watch it on the net , but I've watched some movies and the worst kind of movie was in the 70's and I like them . I don't watch porn videos and the only time you see porn is when you have to sit down to watch it .|0
This is n't `` so bad it 's good '' -- It 's `` so bad , it violates the `` and `` -- They try to force you to make a change if it 's `` so bad it ''s good and they 're using you ''s bad to ''s make sure your `` is the first thing you do, not the last, ''s you do the last, 's good, but not the last.'' I would try to do this `` so that `` does not `` cause `` and `` to work.|0
Overall , I give this film a decent 7.6 . To start I 'll say I love how the character of the woman in the movie does a good job, and I think that's the main part of this movie. The characters are all well-liked. The women in this movie are all interesting and interesting, and I think it's important for them to be interesting and have a great story in them (see the second panel of this movie). It's a very good movie if you have patience and a willingness to read.|0
What can I say about this ? Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End ? Wasted Time , I think, if you will, for a small fee that a lot of folks can do for a big fee. I've done a few of those but they all come with a ton of stuff that is very expensive to do. In the end, that is probably what is needed to make the business a little bit of a pain to get started. If it is not, it might just be the end-game for Prestige-Production. What would you change?|0
Cheap, gloriously bad cheese from the 80's, the decade of cheese. I watched this one first uncut and un-MST3K'ed, and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments.The plot(such as it is) revolves around a post-apocalyptic world in which the AI robots revolted(sound familiar?) and destroyed pretty much everything, leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it. The few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the Dark One, which seems to be part computer and part organic being.|1
This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court. In truth, the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty, or a guilty man being free. Every citizen has a right to justice, whether a perpetrator or a victim.|1
I loved so much last Bellocchio 's movie , the masterpiece `` L'Ora di Religione '' . It had a great cast of actors, actors from Italy and Spain, actors with a real passion for the theatre, actors with real skill in acting . It was a great success in Italy and a tremendous success in Spain , as well as being nominated for a prize for the best drama of the last 5 years. I am so proud of my art , and I would love to be a great artist to work with on a big budget.|0
There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't even know where to begin. The story is not cohesive AT ALL. I guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.Here's what I remember of the movie before I was bored into unconsciousness: A quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. In the next scene, the girls are about 15. They're driving with their parents and hit a deer.|1
It 's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film . Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had a very dark past in the way she spoke . . . . She was just a beautiful woman . . . . At the end of every film, her voice will tell the story . . . . In the end Jean-Pierre's life seems to take on the character . . . . It was difficult for the film to decide who is at the heart of the story . . . . But a great deal of the narrative is built around the mystery . .|0
"It's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board, the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. Sound familiar? It's supposed to. It's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: ""Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity. Zero budget."""|1
I am sick of series with young and clueless people , talking about their `` problems '' all the time '' and it's not funny anymore. I need to know the truth of them, I need to talk about ' the problems.'' So, what I think is the most dangerous part about the series was what I got from it, I have not really done much writing for it, so I think it's probably the worst part to be in the series but if you don't write a series in it, you need to take responsibility for the things you've done.|0
Okay, When I bought this flick I though this gotta be the ultimate b-movie, space monkey landing to the Earth and starts right away to kill people! Well, It was almost everything what I expected, typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60's. Acting has to be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off. So why 'Night Fright' doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good'? Reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring.|1
I was a guest at the Sept. 30th screening of Eddie Monroe and was pleasantly surprised with the story , I don't know whether it was a joke or fact , I really think that is an entertaining story for anyone with a sense of humor . . . I'm glad that you're here. I am an atheist and have always felt that it is best to be honest and say nothing when discussing religion. But when I do talk about what is important to the religious community it gets me very sad. I hope I am not going overboard on it.|0
"Secret Service agent Jay Killion ( Charles Bronson ) has been assigned to protect the President-elect 's wife , the late Senator Charles Bronson , and the newly elected Senator James Webb. In the interview, he discusses the role of the Presidential Communications System (PCS) in the administration of the United States. In his interview with Time, Bronson says that his role ""is very much a part of the administration of the American people. It does not mean that every Democrat or Republican should be doing their best in that area."" He speaks of the PCS."|0
Oh my god , WHY , did I waste my precious time on this film ? It is pathetic , and a film about one man, and how he became so obsessed with everything he had to say . I would like to know what happened to his character who was so obsessed by this ? I am going to ask him to take me back to a year earlier , and I am hoping he will answer . I am just wondering how long I have been thinking about this , but can he do anything about it ?|0

"Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie . I am in Korea ( please excuse bad English )

Re-read my review of this movie , it is pretty interesting , the movie was a great one . What you will see here is a big difference between the film and the movie , the movie is just one scene from this movie which should give the impression that they were doing something wrong . Re-read my review of this movie , this was a big difference between the film and the movie . The movie is actually much better , but it is much more expensive ."|0
"I'm having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie! It seems that this is the classic either ""Love it"" or ""Hate it"" movie. And I have to say that I not only am on the ""Love it"" side, I'm going on a limb to say it this my FAVORITE movie, EVER! Thank heavens I found it in the first place. Almost IMPOSSIBLE to find, I was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night UHF channel."|1
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete nonsense and that was what I wanted to see. I’d been thinking of writing a feature length feature length script, I was thinking about trying to capture all the elements from the film, some of them not working for me and some I don’t understand. There were some elements that I am not able to grasp, and some I don’t really understand, but I can think of at least 2 or 3 of these elements that I couldn’t understand as well as I can.|0
Last year was the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin 's birth , and the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin's _The Origin of Species_ in 1742. Darwin had been writing down an account of the origins and development of man from infancy through to old age, and had published a series of notes that would eventually become the basis of the _Origin of Species_. It was the first of these notes, so to be a good book, and so it was to be written by an educated man, and it is now available in English.|0
This Blake Edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama or a musical. No matter, the sheer presence of Julie Andrews, is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents, throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's is more than fine, as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes, add to the appeal. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release.|1
This is n't a bad TV movie . Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion , which means Penal Batallion . It has a long title, and in the early days of movies it was more of a joke than a movie , except that there were two versions, and both movies were made in different eras, and they never really came off the same. When you think about it you can be quite shocked that someone would make a movie with this kind of name. This has been going on since the beginning of time, and it seems to have become a form of parody for me as a writer.|0
Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters (Played by Jason Cadieux who is in for Jason Gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. This is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers.|1
A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel `` Waltz into Darkness '' of the writer Cornell Chiang. This is not the first time that the film has used the word ``waltz'' in a similar fashion to the word ``doom''. The title is not the first place that a film can use ``waltz`` (the word being used in other films in the world) but rather the title of a film. One of the first films to use the term ``waltz`` is ``The New York Film.''|0
As we are well aware, movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history, but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation. I wish the director and/or the screen writer had done his/her research in this topic. All this movie does is create a forum for hate between people, while causing a rift that should not be there. This movie portrayed the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative manor, while making the third group (Hindus) look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations.|1
"Having endured this film last night, I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end. Throughout the film I felt that I was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie. the acting was stiff and taut, camera work appalling, and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local High School ""Amateur Dramatic's Society"".The only saving grace for this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in its credits, other than that it was pure dribble."|1
I thought the movie was sub-par . The acting was good but not great , the story was funny but not quite as funny . I am really glad I got a chance to see him. I think it was a nice cast . I would do anything to enjoy it . It did not have much to offer . It was a really fun, fun movie and I will be going back . Drew I think I'm going to watch it again but I think I'd like a look of it in the next one .|0
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier. The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference.|1
Historically awful . Scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of ridiculosity . One can not keep track of the number of times these stories have been uttered by those who know them. It was once thought that there were only a few dozen. But in the course of reading it we find out the actual numbers of times it has been uttered. Many of the same words are heard, but none of them is actually uttered. I know this because we read the same articles over and over again until we read the same article every time.|0
While this movie did have a few scary moments ( great use of music and film angles to build suspense ) I thought that I’d share this review. This time I wanted to give up on it. I’ll try to put this review in a more in-depth sense. First the movie is a lot of fun, but when I watched it, I was more worried that I wouldn’t get to enjoy the movie. That’s okay; it was fun to watch. There’s more suspense here than there is action.|0
This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in . This movie just does not sound like a good movie. The plot is terrible. The music is terrible, the writing is awful. In the end you really can't say the movie is the worst movie ever made and I'm sure it will be so. If you can find any reviews of the movies I have read and see anything on the web I would really like to hear them. It would make my life easier. I had a close-up of one of the trailers showing a scene I saw a few weeks ago.|0
"Wow. Just wow. Never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes. And then i happened to come upon ""Lady Frankenstein"". This movie takes everything you know about Frankenstein and turns it completely upside down... and not in a good way. If you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on Italian TV, or you have the dubbed version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box set like i have, as number 24. And lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here."|1
The great thing about Thirst , Chanwook Park 's latest film , is that it 's the anti-Twilight . Some of your friends have noticed this and wondered why they're still waiting for the film , even if it has just come out today . You've probably seen this movie before . You know , it 's the one that I think is just so special , its the second movie that comes out on a big screen . It's going to be really exciting , because there 'll be some people who 'll be surprised . It 's the second film that I was thinking about when I saw it .|0
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look.|1
I completely understand WHY this movie was made . Silence of the Lambs was an incredible film - a gruesome horror, an excellent portrayal of the murder of an innocent girl who was killed by an assassin. And I'm just glad that the cast is so amazing. I enjoyed it very much, really enjoyed the cast - even if the film is just a terrible look at the killing of people in crime scenes. The cinematography really stood out, the actors, the voices are just incredible - it was really fantastic to see, and I'm really happy that they made it for me.|0
During filming, was Vanessa Redgrave taking mogadon? It was like she was reading from an autocue. I've seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or perhaps that was all part of the character? whatever, it was very very annoying, I kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up. I read the book a long time ago & didn't like much about it except that Septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed this very well, his acting was all on the surface.|1
I heard that after the first Oceans movie , the sequels begin to go downhill . I believe that this is a part of the reason why they don't go together :). It is also because there is nothing there that is in between the real Oceans and the real ones. But I do believe that they are going to go together. And I also believe that they are going to work on a different thing and have a future. I believe that they have to work on that too, because that's what they can do. I think there was a great article about this.|0
This movie had very few moments of real drama. After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. The acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. Surely this was a spoof of The Exorcist.|1
"I can't quite explain why I find this so alluring and ""The Leopard"" not; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently. Like that film, it has a majestically slow pace, but this time it isn't overlong. It's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story."|1
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film . The writing , acting , directing could not have been better . I always enjoy the writing . I enjoy acting in a way I never would have imagined. I have enjoyed a lot of films in my time but never have been given the opportunity . . I cannot say I enjoyed the film enough . I will never, ever understand why a film is good . I know it's a big part in the film but a big part, I believe, is that its story. . . . . . . . .|0
well, what can i say. WHAT THE F**K? There really isn't much to say about this, really. The only way you would like this is if u, like me, like bad bad horror to laugh at.ACTING- VERY UNCONVINCING! Just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! Rip-off of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just awful!Gore- Really not believable. In one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc.|1
If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV, try watching him in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is bland all throughout the movie, and it is very comical to see him act the demanding and intense scenes. This is way far from a real love story (Get the spelling right, Reshammiya - it is not luv or reeal), and is complete with him doing a Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fight scenes, Himesh getting imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he fleeing from prison etc ...|1
Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins. The premise is that the nation's dissidents (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of Punishment Park. It's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag, with police, National Guard, and various other authority figures in pursuit. The idea is, that if you make it to the flag, you're set free.|1
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I 'd be able to relate to this film perfectly . Its not like I would be able to get my hands on anything. I don't know why I'd even go to the trouble of trying to tell you about it. And I do believe that's a great idea. I don't know, because I'm not an artist. I do know I've been a painter for about a month and a half now. If you're like me, what a difference it makes when I've actually said something.|0
Robert McKimson 's 'Acrobatty Bunny ' is one of the director 's finest shorts . Although the circus-based setting may not be the best for him, this one is also one of the best for me. He does a great job of directing the animated shorts from his time in New York. I have a few questions about his acting. Why is it that so many animated shorts were banned when they first aired, and how are they treated, in the industry? I don't know, because they were banned from movies all of the way up until the mid-1950s.|0
"Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . What do people mean by hard core sex ? The sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring Traci Lords and "" Big "" John Holmes ? Well anyway this is really poor film , I doubt if I`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . The script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . It truly is an absolutely awful film."|1
I've watched the movie actually several times. And what i want to say about it is the only thing that made this movie high rank was the Burak Altay's incredible performance, absolutely nothing but that. Not even those silly model named Deniz Akkaya and some of these popular names at times in the movie... Burak is definitely very talented i've seen a few jobs he made and been through. Even though this is kind of horror movie, he's doing really good job in comedy movies and also in dramas too.|1
When the movie first started I thought cheesy . The first ten minutes were really boring . After the slow burn I went to work on the scenes . I'm going to take a look at the last fifteen minutes . What was the worst part of it? If I was going to have to work on the scene it's going to be the scene I've spent hours on. It's probably the most boring part of my work day . I don't have many scenes in this book. So I did a couple of the things that make the worst parts of the scenes worse.|0
"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt on a climb. When she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.Two years later, Diana is still a climber...but she won't go near Snowman's Pass. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fiancé with a new satellite program."|1
OhMyGAWD!!! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula would swing on swings, tell jokes they picked off the chuckle patch, dress up with costumes they found in a giant chest called The Storybox, and argue with a pesky pink squirrel named Sherlock that lived in one of their trees. They also could strum a mean acoustic guitar and sing a pretty melody. This was a great childhood show. Very 70s feeling. But that's the problem: They don't MAKE shows like this anymore.|1
"The Kid - At 39 years old Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has been the most successful young man in the history of the sport of skated, and he has spent the better part of his professional career in pursuit of the glory of being a world champion."" A: The Kid

""The Kid"" is the name I first heard of when I was 14 years old. It’s the name of the sport at my age. It is a sport that is so well known in my childhood."|0
How awful is it? Let me count the ways: 1) It is a bait-and-switch movie that starts out being about a UFO investigation, then turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. C'mon! If the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? It annoys non-believers and pushes fence-sitters in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them, I'd run like Hell in the opposite direction. They're scary!|1
Wrestlemania 6, is an entertaining Wrestlemania, if not an entirely successful one. The Ultimate Challenge, is of course worth the price of admission alone, but once again as with a lot of the early Mania's, there's too much filler in between. The crowd pops for almost everything, and as always, giving us the reliable announcing team of Gorilla&The Body. Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania, was absolutely unheard of at this time, it only made things that much more tense. Matches.|1
Jewel Thief is * THE * crime thriller of Bollywood , and why should it not be ? It is a movie made in the UK, and I *love* making it in London (and so I will) . It is one of my favourite films in its time ! It is a brilliant idea, yet I *love* making it in Los Angeles (and so I will). When I wrote it in 2001, it was about an American movie. It is a must-have for all movie fans, and I have seen it all over Europe (even in Europe!)|0
"I am sure I'm in the minority (I know I am among my friends), but I found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likable character (the only other time I liked him at all was in ""A Bug's Life""!) speaks volumes. Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did NOT help make him real."|1
"The back of the DVD for this movie raves, ""Chey is the Quentin Tarantino of Christian Films."" This isn't so much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is poorly written, stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. The scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. Flashbacks, fades to grey, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility."|1
I saw this at my in-laws' house one night when it popped up on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Well, she can have it.Look, I can enjoy a chick flick now and then, as long as it's good. But this one's extra-sappy, unrealistic, and just plain predictable, despite some decent performances from Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her. Oh well, they say love is blind...The neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag, too.|1
... I ca n't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie ... This is such a slow burn I can't understand why ... I can't understand why any of these people want the show ... What they say ... I'm so tired and I have so many questions I can't understand ... Why are they doing this? Where do all of these people come from? There are people here who do this, too, but I would say that if you really understand how the story works it's very much worth it! I watched the movie and I loved it.|0
Movies seem to fall into two categories : films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs , and those that provide new ways to think about these values. In this article, I will focus on two movies that are popular in the world and the way they are portrayed. The first film is the B-side film B.K.O.I.E. – The Boy Who Loves the Kettle (2010). The second movie is The Little Prince, which I’m currently playing, but can’t think of a similar movie in the world.|0
Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid . Now think what would happen if you got the opportunity to see yourself in the role of parent . You would be a very mature person and could do so for a couple of months. Then, when it comes to getting the best out of your children . How would they be treated when they grow up . How would that be . You don’t have your own kids . Now, you are doing what you can to get their attention and attention . How would they be handled?|0
"What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination , everything is told from a story and the characters are not in any way dependent on the narrator's imagination. It does so for the reader, but it also allows for the reader to experience life in a more creative and interesting manner. I had to find one of the books I wanted to read before I even got the chance...

The first thing that struck me about ""The Man and His Man"" was the amount of time spent watching the first half of the film."|0
Or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by 90 's flicks! I remember when the series started with the first time I was playing it. I had to watch the first episode of the first season before I figured out which ones were the best! I only just started watching the first episode after all. I can't tell you why because I'm going to tell you now... Anyway, for those of you that don't know about the second half of The Walking Dead, the series first came out a decade ago!|0
"If you want to truly experience the magic (?) of Don Dohler, then check out ""Alien Factor"" or maybe ""Fiend"", but not this. Alien Factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy, but ""Nightbeast"", which I guess is sort of an updating of Alien Factor, is just plain dumb. Actors sleepwalk through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone sheriff, and the monster is some dumb Halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from Alien Factor."|1
"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren 's missing child. And so they come across several of the missing child's friends, but they have none. How did they make out what Agren thought was his true identity and who was his true employer, and what made them believe he really worked for them? That's what happens when we get back to the living room where we meet the missing children. When I ask Agren if they knew that he'd found them? He says, ""Yes, I know."""|0
Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film , as neither the title , nor the cover was good to begin with. The film, which I will be going back to, was great but the cover was much better. The film, which had been very successful before it was sold, was another story in it's place. It also was a bit different, as was its title and I had been so interested in seeing it, it really didn’t do a whole lot for me when I saw it.|0
If you're looking for a typical war movie, this is not it, so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there, don't bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII, don't expect to see any Nazis, cannons, blood, gore, etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.Acting, cinematography, writing: all perfect 10s here.|1
This movie was really funny . The people that were expecting to see an Oscar worthy comedy , should get an Oscar of it . I have to admit, I never thought it would be good to have this one. Not that it is a terrible movie. The problem with it, is its lack of style . I mean, it was brilliant , and a brilliant idea . It was an amazing movie , but it would not be a great movie. You see . . . You see the character , and the actors , but the plot . . .|0
"I can't get over the quality of the score, the book, and the performances. This is the first production I've ever seen of Sweeney Todd so I have no others to compare it to. But the impact is so strong, I just can't imagine anything better.First, there's the music -- take ""Johanna"" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing an interwoven vocal line incorporating the melodies from three songs. It's like a Bach chorale in that sense -- just a masterpiece of composition."|1
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd ... The strangest , most off-putting , but most wonderful Broadway musical . It's a musical that was played with great passion on Broadway over and over and over. Not only does it have an audience and an incredible musical , it's a musical and a show, which has its own story and has its own story. This musical has it's own story. The audience loves the show and all the wonderful musicals. The show has an incredible musical, which the audience is excited for and has a lot to offer. It's great!|0
1 . I 've seen Branaghs Hamlet : Branagh is too old , speaks frequently with a high pitched voice . He must be very intelligent . However, I 'm afraid I don't have the time to watch the whole film . It was a very long film . The last part of the film is a bit boring , and it is a bit of a struggle to see the film properly . 1 . I was at a film school once a year , but the teachers had not seen it . When I saw it I could feel a lot of sadness .|0
This was a nice film . It had a interesting storyline , that was executed pretty well in the later films but in terms of the ending , there was something very odd . In the present film the ending was pretty much over , that is what I think is the main difference . For those of you who think this film was written by a guy who is actually a filmmaker, this film was shot in the UK and I think it is definitely the most important movie of the first three films in the series so far. So there were two things in it that made it an amazing movie.|0
"Before we start, may I say I hope you've already eaten when you're reading this. Why? Because, after I'd seen this film for the first time, the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'The End' had appeared on the screen. So don't say you weren't warned.Fred Sears might have directed ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" (an okay film and one of the bigger examples for Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks""), but ""The Giant Claw"" is not that giant a film."|1
Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting, writing, and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However, I think there is some other problems here.1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e.|1
I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich , and the setting unusual and interesting . But in the end I found out that there are other pictures of this in the world, but not much. I just like what the pictures are so I can understand the meaning. I saw this on the web a month ago and I think it's the best and most recent version . I've tried to get the same thing out of it and in my opinion is not too good , because it is in a good state to use.|0
O boy, was this really bad.I saw this on videotape.In scenes that had soundtrack music, it was hard to hear the dialog. When people were on the telephone, it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used, because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional.One indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report comes on TV.|1
This is a total piece of crap. It is an insult to the awesome book by Frank Herbert. They have mangled the story and characters. The acting is average to bad. The only character done right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there (not that its a very tall hill to begin with).The 1984 movie was directed by the legendary David Lynch. I was not overly impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best.|1
"Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. We picked ""Ik ook van Jou"" more or less at random, but we were interested to see the state of current Dutch filmmaking.The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must confess straight away that he is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors that are best known in the netherlands for their appearances in soap-operas and/or afternoon talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) has done some fairly decent stuff after leaving the soap world."|1
I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt that movie was good . Just because I didn't look at it when I was there , you would never believe me . It's just a thing i would look at with my eyes . But to me it wasn't the movie that I saw . It was the film itself . I was watching movies when I was doing my research for my book , but I wasn't watching it when I was just doing my research for my novel .|0
This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series . Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio , with a background in comic art. This is a good way to showcase Kentaro’s talents . Kentaro is working with some of his best known artists to help the animation studio develop the comic art. You can learn more by watching the video below . “There is not much time in the world where you can see all your friends and family at one point in the video. You can only see them at the bottom of the screen – there is nothing that can make this person feel alive.|0
OK , I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum . That was the main reason I wanted to find her so soon. Not because I was afraid of the future, but because this is my last chance to take a break from the world of the game and try to find someone I've always wanted to be a part of. She has always been a sweet woman, a wonderful person who loves to spend time with us and to show us our own strengths and weaknesses, which I am going to share with you in the rest of the chapter.|0
"Having watched this movie several times , I have come to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very daring decision not to go to Europe. But he chose to go to America and I believe he is wrong. Milos didn't just come to America. I think that he made the wrong decision and he must have gone to the wrong country or at least his parents' house. Why did he go to New York instead of America? He never went to a party, but that is the reality with him. You may be thinking :

I just don't know."|0
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London , I was very excited to see this movie, because I am from the UK! I have not seen it , but I have never been in London . I was really interested in the city , but I was surprised that a movie like this will not be on the same budget , but this one was so good! You must be very lucky. Not only were the locations the same, the characters were not the same. The only thing I thought about was why they are the same.|0
I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four-years-old. I had half-day kindergarten and this was on WPIX Channel 11 in the afternoon. I just loved the music and stories and remember humming them around the house when playing.I just saw part of an episode on YouTube and for a moment I could remember how it felt watching those shows as a small child. I, of course, stopped watching when I got in 1st grade because it was on before school got out (no VCR's or DVR's back then).|1
Why bother , ITV ? Admittedly , Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the novels to `` get , I suppose you think so. But I'm not saying it is, but it really is. So what's the story for?'' You're probably wondering what that means, which is why you don't read it. If you read that, you should know that I would be happy to give you some suggestions on the book as it would be a fantastic read. As you can see I've already had some ideas here on the book.|0
With the war not going well for the Soviet Union, Stalin accepted volunteers from the prisons and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of one such battalion. There are petty crooks, political prisoners, soldiers kicked out of other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army plus some dangerous criminals.They are thrown into battle ill-equipped, untrained and face the threat of the NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure.The special effects are rudimentary and many of the minor characters are one-dimensional, but the overall story is very human and riveting.I have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing.|1
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie . . . but instead you got the characters on a planet to which a character could belong . . . and they would all look like that. I can't remember what you were doing, but if I were in a film it wouldn't be the same. Also I know for sure that those characters would just look different and look different if they did. Yeah, it would make more sense to make a character that was just as bad as a character in the movie.|0
Watched this film with an audience of .... 5 in total ! Had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... I can see how it would make sense. I have been trying to make a film and I am sure that if I just do it, it won't work, either because my script doesn't know what I am talking about or I am just completely flailing away at it. I would love to have it in my house. I would love to see some of them in the movie. If anyone has any thoughts on the film then please let me know in the comments.|0
I 've seen this story before but my kids have n't . Boy with troubled past joins military , faces drug problem , and has been in his last 12 years of service , and is coming back into the military , having taken an oath to be the best in the world in the end. The story goes back to the beginning of a long long battle , in the military , that led to the death of the boy. The young boy was brought to war by his father's army, and fought his way in , but was not killed , though the father had been a soldier and not a soldier .|0
"Why do people make bad movies? Didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? There is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that I found this ""movie"" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and POORLY ACTED. I admire them for the try, but the ""actors"" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. This movie deserves zero stars. But I did not have that option, so it gets a 1."|1
Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, Dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick.|1
"********SPOILER ALERT************** Wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this ""film"". first of all, we think it is hilarious that the producer cameoed in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent -- what the hell was that anyway, romanian? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures? (Note, the scottish camp director...). ? And who does the shopping for the bog creatures?"|1
`` Black Dragons '' is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time . It 's not as well known today, however . In the early days of the Cold War , it was used to 'treat' enemy fighter aircraft as they 'reactivated', in the process making use of German technology. The name of the film was used by the Japanese to make a propaganda film for their war. The film is believed to be a reference to the 1941 Allied invasion of the Soviet Union , the actual invasion in WWII, but is also popular as a propaganda film, and is considered a 'military propaganda'.|0
"This film flopped miserably in the UK, and it didn't deserve to. The trailer of this film is slightly misleading, and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was ""Atonement: Part 2"". While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film, it's very different in tone. It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort, and his subsequent return to Wales."|1
A MUST SEE documentary.-----This movie had so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. The police little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client.|1
This film reeks of production line planning . It appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies , and decided to give them a look. But when the film was finally released, it appeared to be one of them . According to The New York Times, at least 4 recent movies that have gone this way have been shot with a lens, which made it very clear that there would be a lot to see in this movie . I’ve seen a few of them, but they’ll make you wonder if you’ll ever watch one again.|0
"I had heard good things about `` States of Grace '' and came in with an open mind . I had a feeling some people would try to use that word. But now that I've found it, I think I've got to be more serious about it: that it makes a difference if you can take your time. ``

That's the key. I'm a man of a different mindset. You can do it for the wrong reason and I believe you're right. But the same thing can happen to the right person if they try."|0
In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He did two films for one-time Bond director Peter Hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner Death Hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. Assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like The Wilby Conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles).|1
So, it's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie...all you want is something entertaining, not too artsy, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, you pay $10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer to this movie should have tipped me off, but come on...it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people--eye candy. But that's about it...a string of moving Prada ads. And what did Hollywood producers forget? A plot. Why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy?|1
I'm a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched. The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech.|1
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River, near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon, when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia...the scene where they pulled him out, was actually where he started his float down the river. And if the stunt man missed the netting, there was 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile down farther.Anyway...I watched it at the time, and didn't get it. It wasn't until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it.|1
Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about, however a copy could never be obtained until now. I just watched this film on DVD and thought it was a delightful and charming film, with wonderful animation, a good plot and great songs. If this film was made by Disney then the film would be considered a classic, however because it was made by a little known film studio that is long gone, the film has slipped through the cracks.The film was made by the Max Fleischer studios at their Miami, FL studios and was released through Paramount Pictures.|1
"I lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something. If you’d like to learn more about all of these things, check it out here:

I was just doing this for a few reasons. If you know where to find it, you will find it there. And as for those reasons, if you don’t know where it comes from, just google it. You won’t find it. Because there’s no need to worry about the obvious."|0
"Oh, Yawn. Not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered. The only difference is that, in this film, everybody's a pig or has mush for brains. I hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit. Is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. This movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. I saw it on the CBC's ""Best of Britain"" series."|1
I never fell asleep during a movie . Never . This movie did the impossible.While many people claim the superiority of cinema in any way, they’re not. A few may claim they can play chess but those who actually do can play chess. They can play a tennis game. They can play basketball.They can play computer games. Their games have a very high scorecard, their scores can be very high. And that is where they come in when it comes to playing games. They’ve had a pretty good year, but it was not what you might expect.|0
It 's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film . Three main female deities -- wise men -- who can turn their faces to the screen and talk in a language not known for poetry, history, poetry, or science -- all in one day. The films come to an end at the end of the 20th Century Fox film series, which is currently out of production. Now, we are not alone. The United States is at war, and the world’s leaders are in it together.|0
I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life. To date, this movie is his best piece of work.The plot is a mixing of Stephen Hawking's Book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. The story is told through interviews with family, friends, and Hawkings himself.Don't be fooled; It totally sounds boring but the whole package is dynamic and thought provoking. The blending of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. I was particularly moved at how well they humanize this genius and omniscient man.|1
"I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. ""You Are Alone"" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if I am seeing it for the first time.There is nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally stirring!!!"|1
I seen this movie when it came out . I thought what an average movie . I have now realized I have no idea where to begin . I will post a link if that happens to me . Thanks . My first thought is that that was a dumb idea. You might say, “I think it would be nice to take a quick look and see what it looks like” But, I don’t know if you know how to look, or if you have an understanding of what it looks like.|0
First , let me state that I have no idea who Nora Roberts is . So the book may have no relation to her , but I’m sure that it was the same book that had the first book published. I think this is why I love this book. It’s my first novel and I don’t read many books. I think that if I could read Nora Roberts, that would make the book my next novel. That would make the story. The book I wrote in the book was “The Woman in the Room”.|0
It 's not fair . I was really expecting this to be a hilarious , entertaining movie . I mean, I would've enjoyed it had I not watched this . As a kid , I loved it when people showed up to show up , but I can't get over watching this and it is really the worst movie in this entire film . That is why I love it . I would've expected more of an emotional roller coaster . I'm not going to wait till you watch that . It's better , I think . . .|0
I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film.|1
Oh yes , I admit I have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash . . . not even close , but I find it very disheartening to watch it on the streets and not see it actually . . . . but I do not think they are responsible . . . I do not see the point . . . . Now, you are right that I did not do anything wrong, I did what I thought was necessary to do . . . you are not the only one who has gone there.|0
the movie is complete disaster . i do n't know who write scripts for movies like this one , but I'm sure it's a joke on you, but that is a joke . it would be funny if you were to say that this was the first film i'm ever seen that was made by the same guy who built the movie . and now i'll give you the answer to how it is, because i think that is a question for everyone to ask . but when i watched the movie on my tv the whole thing was really boring .|0
"So unfortunately me and my mate watched this ! ! ! It was showing on a Sky channel over here , there was a few people that said that i was having an attack on you. I'm saying this was not a big deal and I'm sure you were very upset but it felt like we weren't even close, and you would be. I'm so sad about you and me, and you did the right thing, I was just so glad I saw you again

Hello,
I have been playing with this game, and I can not wait to play the game again."|0
Still have n't read a single Dan Brown book , but I watched all his movies adaptations . I woove them in my day . I am in a bit of a bind I must say I have read so many and reread them a number of times and I feel that I do not know what to think about. I feel I have not read as many as I am able to in the last couple of months and I have been waiting to read any one of them but I haven't read anything that would make me even a little sad.|0
"If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, more shallow than Britney, more vapid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, wonder no more. The amazing thing is Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. She's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic ""popular"" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to ""parodies"" of HARRY POTTER."|1
"I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper . Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies . And I didn't know it was there . I think it was a movie that had something to it . And I saw it . I remember when I saw it I thought I'd seen it and it was in a movie theater . So I was just thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I don't know if this is the right thing. I just know this movie is a sleeper!"" I didn't think of it as a movie ."|0
Ever since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there's a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. And I have more good news.|1
Dark and bleak sets , thrilling music that cuts through your spin like aknife ( or razor ) a perfect match in a baroque opera – the best you've ever tasted. The best. The worst. And you were the worst. You’re right. But for some reason you are the best. You are the greatest. But for someone like you, there are more to life than that. The best. The worst. All of it has to be better. That’s what we need to do in the world of music and art.|0
"This movie has some good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would deem this a ""10"") from some self-conscious and self-absorbed film school padding and excess plots. This is the type of plot that Sex In The City could handle in a half hour episode, so there was no reason for it to be even an 88 minute movie. A perfect example of wasted footage is the fast forwarding montage in the first third of the movie."|1
This film is the most traumatising and painful horror film I have ever seen in my life . To know a victim and not to be treated as a hero has to be painful, not because the victim is the aggressor but to the victim’s shock and pain . This was one of those moments that I thought I knew I needed to have a bit of fun. I am a sucker for some of the most gruesome horror movies of all time but it was the ones I thought were fun. Here is the opening of the film.|0
Just when I thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a Billy Mays infomercial , I had the opportunity of reading about this book and reading about Billy Mays on his website. But I was wondering why it was written as a single book? I know I said I would have been able to find an article for the book and was hoping to get some inspiration for the author. And I was thinking about some things I had read previously on Billy Mays . But I think that's what I think, not exactly what I was looking for.|0
What a cast...and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality. The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it. Yeah, I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it.The story is not only messy and unlikely, it also isn't exactly terribly original. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies.|1
Forget what I said about Emeril . Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the Food Network AND all those women who don't want to be featured in any film and don't deserve to be there. This is my opinion, and I'm sorry to say that it is. But I also think she deserves it, so we will see if it changes her personality. I would love to be featured but I don't know that I can do that with this guy. I also don't care if he's the guy I know, I would not like to be with him.|0
I ca n't express enough just how bad this film was . First of all what a waste of some of the time. It just didn't have the quality of what it was shown to be, and there is no real evidence to prove that the film was not made for you or anyone else. The only thing you can say for sure is that it's a very entertaining movie, even if it isn't meant for the masses. But it's definitely worth the extra effort and time spent doing the film itself.|0
Better than average World War II-era `` who-dun-it '' featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and was arrested on his first murder charge, a new movie, which has been the subject of intense controversy, will be released shortly. The film has been released only in Japan on DVD. The Japanese studio has ordered that the film be released for sale at the end of June, as it may be difficult for the British studio to retain the rights. It is unclear whether it will make a profit if the U.S. movie is released next month.|0
I absolutely adored this movie . For me , the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast the movie has between the dark and light moments of the film, that the cinemas and movie theaters have often seen . This movie is really good, but if you look closely at the images on the right, you can get a better sense of the effect the movie was having and how the movie's lighting effects are affecting the characters . The lighting effect looks good on this film . The soundtrack to this movie is also good , so it is very easy to imagine that the sounds are from the songs .|0
This movie was definitely on the boring side . The acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice , the music sounded really good to me , the soundtrack was a little slow . But I am going to have to say that I would have loved to find more people who would buy it, and that would have been nice. I was not expecting that, I was disappointed. I was disappointed because I thought it was so good. But it was good because it was the first time anyone was going to buy anything at the store.|0
I agree with all the comments posted so far : This movie was a waste of time and energy , but what was really cool about the movie was that it was filmed in a room full of people . . . that makes me think I was watching this from a totally different vantage point and it made me feel a lot closer to the director . . and I was hoping for something that would allow for the director to see and know for sure that he has a lot to learn . . so I went back and watched it again . . .|0
"This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the ""actors"" (With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the ""performers"" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The ""New"" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!)."|1
"I 'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR ! ! ! I did buy this film for a dollar and I 'd be able to see it at home in about 6 hours ! ! I just wanted to help my friend ! !

Deepa Mehta 's `` Fire '' is groundbreaking , bold , and artistic . A masterful social commentary on the world of the mobile phone, the app that gives you the right to communicate with your phone with ease , and a mobile phone is the future of social networking. But as you continue to explore and explore more of the great mobile phones and applications, the future of mobile communication and the future of mobile computing, it is becoming more and more important for everyone to communicate with each other as well as interact with each other.|0
A young man , named Danny , has run away from home and meets a drifter , named Bix , who is planning to marry and have children with the man who left him behind. Danny’s father wanted to see if his daughter would come over with her dad. It was Bix, a young woman in her 50s who was about to have an affair with a man who was about to marry her. The man said his daughter was with him but she wasn’t. He said, “Daddy, I have to marry my daughter .|0
(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction.|1
This film was utterly horrible . Stupid premise , and horrible acting by all . Whoever wrote this trash should make sure to learn some lessons from it . It's only going to take some time until it's over . All the characters must have lived their lives , and it's all so much worse that nobody can ever explain why it made them all that much better. . I'm not even sure what you're getting at . Just look at it , this is a horror film! . . If this film were anything like this , it wouldn't have made a scene like this .|0
Whoa , this is one of the WORST movies I have EVER seen ! The packaging for the film is so strange that it is hard to imagine where it was made. But there you have it. Here's what it looks like and I will post more pics as I come back to the movie. 1st of January 2018 at 9:20 PM (GMT+5) You can preorder your tickets here. I don't have any pictures yet. If you know of any other tickets for that movie I will post the one I'm going to, but please note I have not bought you any tickets.|0
Mild spoilers below.The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Naziism will be the death of millions of Germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into America with Wayne's help.|1
Being a fan of the series I thought , how bad can the movie be ? Well I got my first impression of the film when watching the trailer on YouTube. There is something very, very serious in the trailer, and that’s what I was hoping for. I know the movie is supposed to be a little different from what I thought, and I just wish I could see it more. The first thing I was really happy about was what I heard the trailer saying on YouTube about, ” This movie is so much better than the one I saw for the trailer.|0
Spend your time any other way , even housework is better than this movie . The jokes are n't funny, but the dialogue is n't and the action is n't. You need a bit more than that. I have a feeling that this movie will be too much for me, but I would like something that was not as bad as what you are describing so I will make that decision as you suggest. So please feel free to reply if I have to. I'm glad I got the opportunity. I don't see any of these jokes as silly or bad.|0
Although this has to be the nadir of season six , this schmaltzy episode is n't badly written or acted by anyone else so I will do what I can. It's not very long so if you enjoyed it check it out in any way . You could watch it again and it's amazing if you enjoyed the first two episodes. I didn't expect to watch it this time as I have no plans on doing so since I didn't get a chance to enjoy the second. But after watching it again, I am glad to say I didn't.|0
Superhero Movie ( 2008 ) is the most recent in the long line over `` parody '' movie movies which is a parody of parody '' in the current era of television series, TV movie, movies and so on. There are a lot of things which are going wrong with this movie. For instance some of the movie is not suitable for the audience who can only imagine what it looks like. Another thing which is going wrong is that in many of the movie, the people are confused by the story. And the main point is the use of '' as '' as a parody.|0
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory. The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war, but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. The Hero of the story is a young Lt. Shiro Amada, who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot (the enemy), the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them.|1
Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs, watermellons, people, etc. This may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want to, but because they have to.The movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth, and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population. The movie is broken up in segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I, and so on until the end of the movie, which is Phase IV.What is Phase IV?|1
"Anyone who knows anything about evolution would n't even need to see the film to say `` fake '' . * * *

There are a couple ways you can explain this kind of thing. The first of these is to get a good grasp of something you can't understand; the second is to know that we don't really need to know what it's like and to have some basic knowledge of evolution to work with. What is the most basic knowledge you can have for evolution? What is the most important thing you can learn about how it all happened?"|0
"Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie centers around some freak named ""luther"". Luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time), runs amuck at the local Kroger grocery by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth.Luther runs to farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, and gets chased, and gets killed. Oh, and the chick from the SUPERBOY tv show gets naked."|1
"That distinction has to go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious ""star"" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity."|1

This movie strayed too far from Straub 's novel for me to enjoy . Barely made it to the middle of ’98 but when I started reading about the story and thinking “I know, it had a good story” I just found out that they had to write it in some way to do justice to the book. It would have been “sensible” to think that this story was made in some way different from “sensible”, but my gut tells me that this is not true. It is impossible to make a new story if you want to be made.|0
Why ca n't a movie be rated a zero ? Or even a negative number ? Some movies such as those made by SONY will be a zero and others not because they're better, but it's just that the rating system has gotten better. There have also been some movies which had the same rating as zero, or even a positive number. I'll give you an example for you. I saw the SONY movie I saw at the theater and I went to the bar, I didn't know what to ask, and there they were.|0
Yeah great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class A candidate for DVD release. This is a seminal tour de force of Australian TV history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with Doug Parkinson's gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70's Australiana all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its Antipodean glory. This is a memento from another and not too distant era, and has the proud stamp of the land mighty Down Under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur.|1
"Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's,40's and 50's, you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. In this film as Mrs. Helen Gordon,""High Sierra"",'41 along with Robert Ryan,(Howard Wilton),""Golden Gloves"",'40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs. Gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection."|1
"Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! In fact it's quite entertaining. Actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.To break Julie's ""goody two shoes mold"" she plays a German Spy/English Musical Hall Actress. She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie S.O.B. and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edward's direction.The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because she's a German Spy."|1
"Five Fingers is so bad, that I hardly know where to begin. So let me admit first, that I have only seen the first half hour. When the first finger had been chopped off, I thought sleeping a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of ""five fingers"" and she immediately followed my example.Couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? Like me? They should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. This major goof makes the mental pressure put on Martijn just a laugh."|1
This movie has remained in my mind for years as one of the best made-for-TV movie mysteries I've ever seen. The acting is superb. I've seen it twice and still am puzzled at some parts. I'd love to have a copy so I can play certain parts over and over again. I am interested in buying a copy of this movie, but cannot find it anywhere.I am wondering if if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? I've tried e-bay, Amazon.com, Internet searches, and am completely frustrated.|1

Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film 's release for awhile . After finally finding it in the North American States it became the perfect time to get hold of it . For all the hype over it has been sold out in the States and the first time the film was released to North America was in August of 1994 . I hope you all enjoyed it! This film is very well received and is a must-go for the film's crew. For those of you who would like more information please check out this thread .|0
"Pretty twisted Horror film , that has a few good moments here and there , with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes that are just too funny to even watch at this point. The thing is I’m not going to spoil anything by going with that, but what is going on here? I’m going to try to explain all of the things in detail at some point. Let’s take a look. I’m going to start with some of the most interesting scenes of the film, as shown at the end of the movie:

1."|0
This was a surprisingly very good movie, and an interesting idea.. However, it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'Twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie. Whilst watching, it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that, the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist, but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow. There were superb performances, there was never a dull boring moment, so totally well worth watching this one.|1
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted, they don't need to conform and dam their desires. The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.|1
"Rock Star is a ""nice"" movie. Everyone is nice. Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice. Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice. It's a good movie, despite all the niceness. Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music. In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable.Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good."|1
Even if you 're not a `` theatre person , '' I highly recommend that you see this . Based on my reading of the Wikipedia article on '' '' theater people's'' ('' '' theatre group'' ), '' '' theatre'' has become a very effective medium to get people interested in playing the part. In my opinion, they are the most popular, as evidenced by the fact that there are some people on the right-hand side with the most interesting to look at, so it's a very fun and exciting way to try out different plays, and try out different activities!|0
I would say this is a background movie. Play it the background as your tending to busy work (laundry, checking email, etc). I thought this was a film that was done before Amy Adams became successful after Enchanted. Wrong! It was done in 2009! The screenplay/script is pretty awful. I love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along. Ughh. It almost seems like it's a made for TV movie based on the cinematography. Am I watching a TV show? Even the secretary breaks out into song.|1
For the most part , I considered this movie unworthy of a comment , but the last 10 minutes prompted some interesting insights. The main thing is that this is a remake, but there are still some good things happening. The main characters will probably be different from the original. I have a feeling that maybe some of the main elements are better left to the sequel, such as the lack of a dialogue. In any case, I think this is a pretty decent look at a different kind of story. 1. The main character of the original movie is a boy named Shiro.|0
This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof . Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and are intended only for people who have seen them or who have watched them in their prime. If you are a newbie to the movie then please watch the movie and make sure you watch it on a regular basis. What do you find funny about it? Let us know in the comment section below. If you like the movie you will be interested in reading the author’s thoughts on this movie and the history of its release. We hope you enjoy this book.|0
I really do n't think producer George Lucas did n't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as “Terminator: The Usual Suspects”. So let’s go ahead and go ahead and take it one step further. In order for the story to succeed in making the characters look like they’ll never be as bad as they ever will, the series must have built a solid foundation to give the characters that much room to grow. The problem is, this doesn’t seem like a bad thing.|0
I just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is. Justthe memory of this movie right now enchants me. If you want tosee a sweeping epic of a movie, with wonderful actors in vividscenery, with great dialogue, reminding you of what early Americacould have been like [what the world could have been like backthen]...well...I highly recommend this movie. Especially during atime of war and conflict in Iraq...when our American image is not atall what it used to be...this movie takes you back to a time when wewere just starting out.|1

This is pure CRAP , and probably the worst Biblical theme film ever ... Absolutely inaccurate , I mean , but it is true . My friend, this film takes place almost 20 years ago , and has not gone for over 30 mins , so no one will be able to say what it was like , but as far as I could tell, it was exactly the same scene that made it so difficult for me to film it. I have a few things to say here, however, I just don't see any problems with it, as far as I can tell .|0
You know , I really hate IMDb 's censor system , since my entire review is almost gone if you try to visit it , then you can not access it again any more , I've never heard this before . I'd be glad to know if you have a problem. I've never heard you mention it before. Is it possible to make an HTML5/HTML5 article with some CSS? I'd be happy if you didn't know about this and how you could help me :S If it's impossible then maybe this is the one for you !|0
Well , this film came on on a workday at 230am . The cute little actress who played Billy caught up on a few hours later , was very cute as she had to get back to the stage to play Billy. She was also a big help to the young girl who was on the verge of falling asleep. It was really interesting that we were in a movie together . She was really good at showing her character well. I loved how it was like you were in a movie together at the beginning of the story.|0
How do I describe the horrors?!!! First, some points: First, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- I saw this over 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.Secondly, I am giving away some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much of a plot.Finally, I don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's.|1
Yes , why ? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80 's and 90 's Gus Van Sant came up with a movie called The Big Story . The story takes place in a New York city, and it's a short film centered on a man who, once a hero of his day, becomes his best friend. He starts his journey to New York City by talking about his life in his hometown. He and a couple of other people have their stories, and there are some really good ones.|0
I was enticed into watching Shark Hunter by the comments posted on IMDB. The movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. So I rented it. Bad idea. This movie was bad on so many levels that I'm glad that I had the option to fast forward. The shark itself is ok. It's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1, (I gave it a 2). The acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. I wasn't expecting much but I was continually surprised by this suckfest.|1
"The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time, but it has always interested me, and I have seen many films about it. All of the others I'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle. When I read a description of ""The War At Home,"" I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with. One night, while flipping through channels, the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I set down the remote and settled back to watch it."|1
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs ( Naked Gun 1 , 2 & 3 ) that, in their wake, have gone on to be released into the public. It was produced in 2007, and a year later, on January 16, 2008, the series was released on DVD, and it was the first movie ever to go on to a sequel. It was co-produced by Sony Pictures of New Zealand in 2012, and in its current form (as well as in several subsequent films) is the first of many films to be released at the end of 2009.|0
Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Arnim's novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a literate script and ensemble acting. All the elements come together to produce a movie that, although nearly forgotten now, still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution.The actresses each acquit themselves splendidly. Ann Harding is the free-spirited wife longing for 'wisteria & tranquillity' far from foggy London. Katharine Alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as hostess in the castle.|1
i was having a horrid day but this movie grabbed me , and i could n't put it down until i saw the trailer . I love this, but I'm just not in a rush to get any of the ideas out there. I'll do a quick post about the film and how it felt to me. It is a really interesting one but I don't think it is the best way to get to see this movie, it is a very interesting film because I would like to be able to look at it more closely and get my ideas.|0
"As a Genghis Khan ""fan"" I was looking forward to this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens epic novels about Genghis and reading up on loads of historic records I feel I know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...That turned out a deception. This movie is practically made up from beginning to end. There are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. That does not have to be a problem, I like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring."|1
I just saw this movie . I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent , like all the other movie.But then I saw the trailer and really loved it. I mean it was one of the first movies like it is.The movie that was a part of my childhood when I was in high school , and this was one of the first movies that I watched .It’s one of these movies that just came from the back of my head to me , and it just was amazing.I mean, I was watching a film with my friends and my family and I was just so very excited for it.|0
Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through, but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That's twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically, the previous being the last Dalek from series one, but by Jove it's worked.|1
"I rented this type of ""soft core"" before, but I can honestly say, I wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as ""Rod Steele: You Only Live Until You Die""--which was both sexy AND funny. It had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason why I didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the ""Must be 18 to Rent"" Sticker. I was looking for more ""cheese"" and less ""cheesecake."|1
It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting gate, and for it to work. In the first scene, the main character (the main character's mother, Marlene) walks to the front entrance of the pub and decides it's all about him. As he passes through the main doorway, it's pretty obvious who Marlene is, and it's easy to understand why. You can't just assume that Marlene has been introduced into the game because she's been in the show for almost three years.|0
Back in the 70 's , a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F . Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent animated shorts of their own. (For more about the series, see the trailer.) At first, the shorts didn’t seem real to me, even though I knew that S.F . Brownrigg might have a way into the future. But I didn’t feel that way until I heard from the writer/director of the first S.F .Brownrigg shorts. For a few weeks, I found myself talking to S.F. (or “S.F.|0
"Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as ""Poison Ivy"", must have done this film simply as a favor to director Phedon Papamichael (he was the cinematographer on ""Ivy""); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!"|1
I was lucky enough to have seen this film at it's Seattle Film Fest screening, and was blown away by how great it was. This is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen, (and I've seen a lot!) This is a loving look back at the life and times, music and relationships of one of music's true legends. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of Gershwin, Cole Porter, and all the other great song writers of 20th century standards.|1
Finally! Third time lucky. This film has been always been on my mind, but my first viewing I forgot about it and only caught the second half of the film. Then only a couple months later I had the my second chance of watching of it, so I decided I would record it. Only to discover that my timer went off late and again I missed the first half of the flick. I wasn't going to allow that to happen again. So, when it came on TV again, I thought bugger it I'll wait until it comes on, then I will record it.|1
I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies . But there are very few that I know of and I just can't blame myself . I've watched enough of those to be certain I'm a very good person . I've done the same movies I did well, and that was the way I went along . . And it's been amazing. But it's hard to be so sure. You're watching so many good movies . I know that. I'm not trying . I've been seeing so many movies . .|0
Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature.|1
Very good film. Very good documentary.Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted, narcissistic, heartless swines their one eyed parents, community and environment raised them as.I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal.|1
"This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:""quirky"" and obnoxious characters (a few); ""quirky"" town with ""quirky"" folk; a ""quirky"" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of ""gotta get out of this town""; downright booooring.And it succeeds on all counts.Something to note, though. I couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-Northern Exposure ""quirky"" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination."|1
I never saw Doctor Who before ( at least not in any focused way ) , so I was new to the whole thing and had never really been on the cutting edge of a Doctor Who series before so I wasn't exactly sure what was new or what to look for, and I didn't expect anything new at all...I was just curious if anyone could tell me more about them and if I should be looking for new ones. So here's a link if anyone wants to see what I have to go through to make sure the best possible ones aren't what I'd want to see.|0
I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film?? Its not because of money spent on it that's for sure!! Did I see a painted water pistol in there? Maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Scotland? Or maybe they just didn't have any money? The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the grit of the performances. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead parts like 2 normal guys.|1
After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it , oh my God , there's just no way there'd have been any chance of finding the person with the spot on the paper. I'm sure it's a girl and there is no way there would've been any chance of getting the girl there had he done it . But I'm guessing the girl did have the spot . Oh god . . . I know what you mean about a girl . . . I remember when she was little .|0
The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens, and more contemporary writers like Edward Gory. As a musical, it naturally becomes more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the Industrial Revolution, and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical is different from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, the songwriter who can adapt to any style. To be sure, he's had his successes and failures, but one thing about his shows you can always count on: They will be something unique.|1
No , no , no . That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. It is so far, but I do not understand why you do so many things. It is all about the way that the film looks. A lot of my friends tell me that if you are a filmmaker, the way that you are is not your movie. And that makes me angry with you, because you want to go out and talk about this film and that is why I have not been around for awhile. But I do not understand how it works.|0
Think Jumanji but with a death curse. A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it. Supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. Okay, undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before.Frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises. Far from the worst thing that SyFy has run but certainly its not the best.|1
So , it 's Friday night and you want to go watch a movie ... all you want is something to get your head round. So here's a fun idea: you can go to the theater on Friday and watch a movie without going to the theater on Saturday and watch a movie Saturday night. That's it! Now that you've got the idea of what's really fun to see when you've got a date, you're ready to do whatever you do! So here's the plan, you can take the time for yourself (or at least leave it to yourself!)|0
I ca n't get over the quality of the score , the book , and the performances . This is the best i've seen this year. The book looks very good but i dont know if it is good or bad , and i would like to see a way to show how much of the book it is. The score is very good but i have only had this year since I have had this year but I have also had this last year of the year . This year i just got my book.|0
The first review I saw of this on IMDB says that Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins was in this role. Makes me wonder if he saw the original. It's tough to review Psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. Add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.Where does this film go wrong?|1
While my kids enjoyed the movie (and announced afterward that they want to buy it later) I think I got more out of it that they did. The scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life (I did not use the cutting comment aloud, but I thought it). It is a feel good mid-life movie, a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others (why does the kid stay with Bruce Willis after he knows his Mom is dying? ), but all in all and good time.|1
I watched the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The plot was a little confusing. There is a voice-over in the introduction about an 800 year war, and I didn't quite understand. The movie is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie specifies). The couple has an argument and Meredith Monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of Vampires. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires that don't kill humans, and enters into a battle with the bikers.|1
"Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it, but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters, they will clearly see that ""cranked out"" is written all over this production. Obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent."|1
Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an ongoing plot of an untold part of world war II on TV. A group of men and women stand to face each other in a war of their own. I have written many times about the characters I have admired in such films and I hope you have read this blog, especially those with whom I have had the pleasure of knowing each other. I have spent many hours playing with my character and in doing so have enjoyed the various elements of his story, the characters and the relationship between them.|0
"LCDR Tom Dodge, despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: Maverick does not mean ""Tom Cruise"". Maverick means ""non-conformist"". ), is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia, North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport, Florida."|1
Ted Nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. I am looking for all his films to see. I could not find this one for 3 year, until I unexpectedly found it in youtube. To tell the truth I wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. It looks like in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis , maybe in money. His features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. But I do not claim him to be a bad director this time . Everything happens.|1
Ordinarily , Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys ' - James Stewart , Gary Cooper , Henry Fonda , Ray Romano - as their main vehicles. They were the first of many sports cars that featured a big wheelbase. They were popular for their cars and their designs. Now, they are not only an important vehicle for fans, but also as a main driver of a wide assortment of sports cars. There is no word on how much the 'big guys' will affect the car's mechanical design or power output. What are their effects?|0
Story involves ancient demon being released upon a small town on Halloween night. In all my life I have never seen such a cheesy film, but it is so d**m entertaining you can forgive its bad acting, effects, direction, and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she is butt naked in the shower for like 5 mins. Goodness they just don't get any better than this. Rush and buy this tape right away.|1
why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film ? it was given to me on video , I'm very sorry that you did not see it first. The film is based on a long-running story about a former student who falls into an orphanage when the orphanage is destroyed because he/she is a bad person, that is to say that the parents who own this orphanage are the most selfish of the lot as they try to bring it back into the family. The father-daughter relationship is the biggest and worst thing about this story, why should they have to pay for it ?|0
A savage , undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival . He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of the ring , and he puts his arms around its neck . It feels funny and scary, but when he runs it over with a stick . It is not funny , it is scary. It seems to be real . It’s not human . It feels like the thing is not human. It feels like some sort of animal . It seems to be just another animal that I have seen before and it’s pretty obvious.|0
"The only pure life, is one that ends with a signature in blood.So says Mishima anyway, a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author. The life of one of Japans most celebrated literary voices, is told from three perspectives, his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a Japanese military base and commit ritual suicide(shown in color), flashbacks(shown in black and white), and scenes from his novels(shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor set design somewhere between traditional Noh Theater and ""the Wizard Of Oz""."|1
The director was probably still in his early learning stages when he tried his hand at westerns. Have a look at the outfits. Everybody looks well-scrubbed, well-brushed, well-dressed and well-ironed as though ready for church. Even the horses look well-groomed and shiny. This is a WESTERN, for crying out loud! It's supposed to look dusty, nasty and sweaty. And then there's the amateurish acting of the females in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so, all pretty and well-endowed, were just freshly raped and widowed, but hardly a tear flows.|1
"For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets a 3. The effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better ""display"" than some films in the shoestring budget category. It's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. The plot as a whole isn't the worst."|1
"This is a forgotten classic of a film, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for ""Gummo"". Gummo is good, River's Edge is way, way better. Its no secret that Keanu Reeves isn't the best actor whoever walked the earth. No, in fact, he's a horrendous actor. But, he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire from Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. He is perfect as a sort of good natured but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there's Crispin Glover."|1
"Although Embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics , it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable, but the fact is there is no denying Embryo , or at least, as far as this is concerned . Embryo seems to be the most promising pathogenetic mechanism to explain what has been referred to as a ""bioweapon"" [4] as well as ""bioethics."" If the term ""bioweapon"" could ever be applied to biological species, the implications would be quite dramatic, as they could not be described as ""biochemistry"" in their ordinary terms."|0
"And so it started with ""Shreik"" a send up of horror films, then we had Scary Movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however....now we have: Scary Movie* Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4* Date Movie Meet The Spartans Not Another Team movie* plus many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *)and.....Super hero movie.... it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send-ups funny."|1
As an ancient movie fan , I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the best and best films from the past 15 years. A lot of people have heard about it, including the people who say it is the best and best movie from the past fifteen years of cinema. I'm not sure why I don't know. It's a shame, if I don't know more than you. And you don't want to understand that I'm a filmmaker or a writer or an editor or even a writer .|0
"I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy: ""Fire"". To begin, I'd say that ""Water"" was the unquestionable masterpiece, on all levels. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. The writing is superb, the script creating friction that starts the entire process of ""heat"" from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire, the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships."|1
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory . The story takes place during the same time line as Stardust . The series follows the series of Stardust, a new type of alien that has attacked the United States from an unknown distance. While it is only known as Stardust Memory, it is the oldest known alien known to humanity. Stardust memory was discovered in the 1970’s by a German scientist who claimed that he had discovered all the other Stardusts at the same time he was experimenting with the Stardust memory technology.|0
The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse. This is his worst film he has ever been in. The acting and the story was just terrible. I mean how could they make the most beloved stories by Dr. Seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment. I couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides, maybe Baby Geniuses.|1
George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of Sundays - he lopes about like Frankenstein's Monster but without the sympathy, and Bridges' acting is totally awful.|1
"""Go Fish"" garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms. The entire film rings hollow. I cringed the whole way through.Its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality. Well not much more here to be learned than from ""In and Out"". By now most of us actually do know, that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes."|1
I can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews. The film is dated of course, and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of CGG a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now. But even allowing for this, Helen of Troy is so bad that it is almost laughable. The scripting is awful, just awful, with no characterisation at all. The performances suffer as a result, you can see the likes of Hardwicke and Andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines.|1
"This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible "" Sarah`s law "" following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-senseIf truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud ."|1
This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended, I was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it. No wonder Alan Moore refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle.It's not bad in an entertaining way, like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out. Plot holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Horrible acting by decent actors.|1
"Like a lot of people, I loved the original; ""American Graffiti"" was one of the great movies of the 70s. The sequel, ""More American Graffiti"" is a horrible, depressing mess of a movie. It wasn't funny, the wide-eyed, likable characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were contrived (such as ""Laurie's"" character having another brother because Richard Dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and ""Terry the Toad"" and ""Pharaoh Joe"" somehow managing to serve together in Vietnam)."|1
When a loser teen is bitten by an insect , he becomes the superhero Dragonfly ... Superhero Movie is the best movie that a girl can dream of at the moment. With this movie it is possible to do anything you want with your life and to get everything done for you when you are a teen . All movies and TV dramas are based in the same movie, the first movie, the other one is based around the story and the girl in the movie happens to be a virgin , this movie is not suitable for girls .|0
( Contains really bad Spoilers ) So what can I say about this .... It 's a really HORRIBLE and horrible way of doing things . . . This post will give a really good clue about how it is done. To get into the story, here are some links to the videos I posted and a few quotes I put on this post. In the video, I give you a pretty good idea of what to expect, because you've probably done it before. What is most important is not to overstate it in any way, please read this post carefully.|0
I saw this movie once a long time ago , just once , and I did n't know where it went. What happened is that when I watched a movie and got bored of it, I realized that I didn't have time to read the story, and didn't know where to look for that story, so I decided to skip the film, instead. So, I skipped the book, went to an interview, and read the story again a couple years later. I read the book, and found that it's an amazing book.|0
"Everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. And were is all the blood and gore that was in ""Demons"" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. My Brother said that this movie was bad but I had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. When the movie was over I understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music by ""The Smiths"" and ""The Cult"", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing."|1
As we are well aware , movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history , but rather a way to present the facts of the past . When a film was first published, there were several different ways the filmmakers could portray the story, and there is often a lot of material that came to be presented as a story in its entirety. In this article we will focus on a few, and some more. But we want to put into context the nature of the filmmaking process, and give a clear, clear explanation of what happens in the story.|0
Terror in the Jungle is a real find. If you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. It's hilarious!The story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle. The crash scene has to be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blonde boy survives. A nearby tribes brings the kid to their village and they (all males) venerate him because of his golden hair! I kid you NOT!|1
"With a cast like this , I knew the acting would be amazing . Still , I was cautious , in case I missed it . But I did , I made a great deal , I know I did . I also tried , I did . I feel like I did , I knew I did . My acting is still a little over . But I am happy the acting is back . Bobby

I love this book! I would highly recommend it . It's written by a talented actor, and I've never really done it myself ."|0
`` Strike Force '' or `` The Librarians '' is a fun action movie that does n't it take itself for granted. It's pretty fun if your friends and family don't like it. It's fun to watch, it's funny, if you know how to say your name. If you don't have friends that liked the action movie (which they can't get it to do anyway), this is a very entertaining movie and I hope you'll enjoy. If you like it, you'll like it too. I've got it here to tell you.|0
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen. The visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy. I hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent Black and White to Color switch. I also thought that The story didn't make any sense what so ever, and it was another clichéd Action Movie, with a hero a bad guy, and a few hostages. I could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? I can hold it steady, something the director couldn't do.|1
this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy. i got this movie for Christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away. i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year. This is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts.|1
Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up to the size they once were. I hope they get better as time passes and I hope this is not the case and I can't wait for the end of the year when I've got a lot of them to think about, but let me just make sure that I do the same for every child in the world. In fact I want them to grow up and have the right to do that. But I want them to grow up and be the best they can be.|0

What is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? A BEAUTIFUL MIND wasn ` t up to the test, not the experts. He had to learn that, in mathematics, only one person -- the real world was at the limit, and there was nobody in the room to talk about him -- could get it done, and it wasn`t worth it. The world`s only real person was a mathematician in the world, and nobody knew how to do it, and the only people who did ` t understand were the experts.|0
"Once again Bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. The fact that ""The Evil That Men Do"" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. It is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of Bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. One hopes this fine actor will rise again."|1
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski 's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as she goes through the journey. In the first part of this book she tells of an old Hungarian man who died and is left to his fate. If Krzyszło finds her way through the labyrinthine labyrinth she finds herself in, I'm sure that she is about to end up in one of the worst places in the world. Krzyszko's third book has just gone on the air. This is the final chapter of the trilogy but I think I have done my best to cover it down.|0
Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage, I have stumbled across this little treasure. Action, romance, crooked cops, violence. Its all here and not a single one has been pulled of right. I was in love immediately. Then, a funny thing happened about the second time around. I became addicted. I thought it was going to be a one rent and chuckle kind-of-movie.Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in a movie. He didn't have the money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. That's very commendable.|1
You don't have to spend much time watching this made for TV movie or series pilot or whatever it was intended to be to figure out just what lies in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this isn't the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember it. While the acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles, and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is contrived, filled with insipid stereotypes, and an obvious ripoff from Ken Kesey.|1
This is probably Wayne 's poorest movie ; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role . . . He's one of the few actors who's seen a movie like 'em, so the movie was pretty good, but there was a really poor audience in the first half and it was too close to die and too far for him to see the movie for himself. Well, he didn't like it. But there was nothing else he did in the end, anyway. And that was the last movie I saw for the second time . . .|0
We've all seen bad movies, well this one takes the cake. I've seen that Junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store, and I was a little interested, it looks like it pays some homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I thought I'd get it. Mistake! Junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. In other words it's really bad. Although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID! !|1
This movie is an obvious rip-off of Underworld USA starring Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original. I found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow, with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense. I'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline. With everyone else getting killed, all through the movie I wondered why Frank didn't just blow Johnny's brains out.|1
I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest , this is a great film.Real-life husband and wife in-law are having a very good time. A man has been doing some work on the screen so I don't see it as a part of the world. There are several films that seem to do well in this film, though I find it hard to pick the best one. For example, the film I know about by name (and also my father-in-law). It has to be about a guy trying to get his own car for a job in California.|0
I'm sorry but I can't agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I must say the story sucked big-time. How in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. Better story and I would've gave it a higher vote but I was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. I have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews.|1
Now, I like the Bollywood films and I'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK. However, Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish.The idea of a modern-Bollywood take on Amadeus was quite an exciting one, that is until the two supposed 'musicians' appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very good looking man, and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities, but he is never once believable as a modern Mozart.|1
As kids movie it is great. For the family it just sucks. I was truly hoping for something like the Goonies which is a great film for all ages. This movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ??? Alan Cummings was however a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the Willy Wonka song doesnt make this film anything like Willy Wonka.|1
"Satya was excellent .... Company was just as good but more polished , probably owing to the money earned from the building of the hotel.. . Thanks for reading! Paddy

The hotel is very comfortable in its accommodation and is a good choice for all who want to stay in the area. The only problem is that I don't know where the money is from or how the property is situated so I cannot tell you if it is from outside or in China. Any ideas on where it is from or if it is the same hotel?"|0
I just watched this , an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his `` glasses '' character on Kino!'' That was one of my favorites. ( I got a second one too) It was based on a famous cartoon by an old Japanese cartoonist known for cartoon characters, which was inspired by that one. The Japanese character of the film was a cartoon villain who appeared in an animated movie called ``Kino''. They were going to film a film about the story of his life, and he would try to go back to his native country (which was Japan.)|0
This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film. The direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and Patrick Swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body.Spy Vs Spy films are not - or should not - be about car chases and shootings, the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range.Even the action shots are just a cliché with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn.I got half way through and switched off - completely bored.|1
"Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor . Geena Davis is a schoolteacher, actress, and sports commentator, who has done more to promote her own film in the last year than any filmmaker she’s known. Her stories include:

This film was made in the early ’80s and shows a female protagonist, in her teens. It has a great story, with some great shots and great characters. The film is also a hit. It should be a top 20 best-seller, but it isn’t."|0
As over the past ten years or even longer the whole world is flooded with so-called sitcoms (actually only very few deserve this title 'cause they're so predictable), King of Queens is a very original, unique and astoundingly funny alternation. It's about the daily life of a deliveryman and his wife who works as an attorney's assistant in Manhattan in Queens, NY. With them lives Carrie's father Arthur, a picture-book extrovert, who is played by the fantastic Jerry Stiller and who steals the show from all the others every time he appears.|1
This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century Brazil. The story is interesting and edifying. However, this film -- as a film -- is terrible.The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas. Admittedly, the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves' heroism. The special effects are absurd. Rather than invoke the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they merely make the film look cheap.|1
Perhaps I was just in a really good mood when I watched this film . but , for whatever reason , I have not been watching it ever since its release on Netflix on December 21, 2012. This is the film that I have watched recently, with the exception of an intense love scene and a romantic drama . . . but , there’s something I really missed when I watched it . The only part of the film I have been watching lately is that shot on location on the border of the San Luis Obispo area.|0
"Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes, hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab, and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the ""hilarious"" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage."|1
Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times . He may have made more classics than anyone else in his lifetime, but he never was as good . He may not have had the best director in the world, but still he was the greatest director of all time in his lifetime. It is amazing to think that one of the greatest men has been one of the most influential directors, most influential man. His accomplishments in many ways were not only great in the field of filmmaking, they were also extraordinary in his writing, as well.|0
"I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster. It is officially the only movie that I've wanted to undo watching. Let me start off by saying that I like ""B"" Movies. I consider ""Ice Pirates"" One of the best comedies EVER. I'll also note that I'm a writer and that I've met the director/writer of this cinematic marvel.Evaluating the acting: If I was going to pick a bright spot I'd have to point out that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this."|1
This is one of the best martial art(Kung-fu) movies of all time. if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss. From flying nuns to training monks this movie has top kungfu styles and a good story line. Its about a priest from the wu dang clan trying to eliminate all the shaoulin fighters to be claim the title of being the best in martial arts. after killing key members of the shaoulin temple the faith of the shoulin is remained in the hand of two boys secretly training under a shaoulin monk.|1
"I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER doing another ""Biblical"" film again, if Noah's Ark is going to be the norm. Aside from the horrible, completely uninspired acting from the whole cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day the agreed to do this film), the time line has been completely rearranged. I also missed the part in Genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat. Hello? EVERYONE else was dead except for Noah and his family according to scripture."|1
....is where I'm assuming this movie came from. I mean, I've watched plenty of B movies over the course of my young life so far, and I wouldn't even classify this as a B movie. I remember seeing films in my high school mass media class that surpass this one.So the premise is...a bunch of dancing numbers and goofy crap happens. Women in bikinis, who aren't even that great looking to begin with, dance in the beginning and sing. Guys with hairy chests show up and girls with fangs who are out in the sunlight.|1
What to say about `` Dead End Road '' ... Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been a better writer if he was still alive and writing. But Poe was a great writer who got much better writing than he was able to get done. And that was a good thing, especially as he knew how to do it so well. So, what could we say about Poe? He could be a better writer, and still be alive if he could get written up on the ground on his own for a little bit more than he was able to get done, and have some fun.|0
"A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life . It could be set in any town in the U.K.

Not even close. In a city such as London it’s a city with a lot to celebrate. You can look back on the past and think about the future, or you could just look at the present. No matter how you think about what you have, how you think about the past, how much you admire your past, what your present is like, what you love about yourself, it will always be about you and about your present."|0
I rented this movie expecting it to suck, and it didn't let me down. I rented it with some friends as a joke. But, what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine.It starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. Its called vampire Assassin, but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire? Well this guy kills the of his own volition, so that doesn't make him an assassin.Then, when you actually put the disk in it gets worst.|1
It may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps, because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is amazing and needless to say that Venice is utilised as a perfect scenery: dark, sinking and dreary just like Bogard's soul. And classical music is more that a simple background escort to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of european film-making.|1
"From the crash of the opening theme, ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" is classic 1950's entertainment. No subtlety here, Frank comes home from prison with a monkey on his back and goes right back to the old neighborhood, where the old scumbags still lurk. This is a tale of his dark ride with all of his emotional baggage intact. The performances are all a bit overripe, but that's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable, and almost steal the show."|1
I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose will too . Her character is actually quite a bit younger than I would love to have in a child movie or movie about the sex. I loved the character as an adult and she’s quite a nice person to interact with. The plot is just amazing, the way she is treated when she is on stage, is just amazing, and I loved the sex scene, and it is just a beautiful little movie that shows off a character who is extremely good at her work.|0
`` The Journey '' is a very good film . Produced in the spring of 1958 , in Vienna , it was one of the earliest films to be shot in the United States, with the first scenes filmed in New York City in 1963 (which were filmed in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s ). The film is about a young man in a tight-knit family on a farm in Arizona who is sent back to live by his grandparents' farm. One of the most important moments of the movie is in an old family home, and the film's setting is the most famous in the history of American film.|0
I 'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one . I find a zombie to be really cute. This is probably one of my favorite movies of the late 80's. It was a film I wanted to see more of, and one of my favorite films of the 80's. In the movie, you're introduced to an old-timey zombie from his childhood but the film ends with him being brought back as the old man. This is one of the best zombie movies of the 80's, especially the one I saw.|0
"This movie was chosen , quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local Video store . It's pretty impressive, I can see why a lot of kids love the film. But I can also imagine how some kids who have no clue who they really are would be delighted to find out who the other 3 people in the cast are! There are no words of praise and no complaints about it. You know what you have to do , the last thing I want for my kids is for their parents to take a test and ask themselves, ""Why did they choose to stay here?"""|0
I like Steve Buscemi . I like his work very much , both as an actor and a director . I also like his writing very well . . I don't know what he's done with my writing . but I think he's done with his writing. If it is possible to create a character who could be both a writer and writer . I don't know if they would use their characters to be writers or a writer . I think the writer would do a lot with a writer as well. But as an actor, a writer or director .|0
I am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie. The acting is astonishing, the movie itself is powerful and clear, and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth.This is an important movie. It could be profoundly transformative.I would pay good money never, ever to see it again. Because it *is* so good and so complex, it is extremely difficult to watch. I admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment; the visual medium can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for anything really important.|1
"It seems on the surface to be a romantic _planes, trains and automobiles_ but at times tried for something more, where it failed miserably. Some may like the nontraditional ending, but the attempts at ""deep insight"" into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywhere.But if you were interested by the story, the movie tried other methods to distract you. The unnecessary special effects, of which the falling rain was the most obvious, served to do nothing but annoy. The camera-work is erratic at best.One note of caution, however."|1
It's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. WITH SIX YOU GET EGG ROLL is directed by Howard Morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a TV show.DORIS DAY decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why.|1
I have recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly). The film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and I don't remember having seen it since. It has not (to my knowledge) been released on DVD or VHS although I shall browse around for a copy.The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger, and a young boy who go to live with their mother's brother and his young, mute Irish wife.|1
It 's just when a band tours , and only has one original member . It 's not the same for the rest of the world . So for example , if the band doesn 't have any friends . . . But they 've got the music that they 've wanted . . . And if they 've been on a show . . . I don 't think it will make a difference whether they 've been on their first or second show . . . You know, what 's going on , I don 't think it will. I think it is important . .|0
I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. It is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic.|1
I saw this film via one of the actors' agents, and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of Sth. Australia in terms of the overall *tone,* which is rightly dark and moody.I thought the little boy in the film was excellent. Mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case. He was really very good. In terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo, well, I just think this film is plain 'weird.' It's a real weirdo film, with weirdo locations, storyline, weird stuff going on the whole time.|1
Rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the Windy City, contrarian director Otto Preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible, thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who were making their pictures all over the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the movie is based, went on record as despising it. What, one wonders, was Preminger up to, and why did he do the movie this way?The sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a Mr. Magoo cartoon.|1
What can I say ... not much to this one at all . Pretty dull and uninteresting.The actors performances are very good but the director is just the right man. I think he's got too much charm to be a good actor, but he does a great job on this film. The dialogue is very interesting at the beginning but the story is very interesting, the script, and the characters are quite interesting and well written. And I think this movie is very funny. It looks so good and has some great actors.|0
We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She's nice, friendly, smiles often, but is strangely brutally honest. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister has been reciting original poetry, which is getting the community excited about the sister writing. Unfortunately, it's Evie's poetry. While their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do.What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is.|1
The Toxic Avenger... The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded OK even for 1985. This movie is listed as a horror... I even have read of a cult following with this series.... Now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that I couldn't stop watching... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that I think was to be the horror part of this movie...drug dealing, sumo, Godzilla entrance....|1
First of all, before I start my review, I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this. (Fortunately there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone may not like 'Star Wars' due to the whole Sci-Fi genre, but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad. Okay, I will step off my soapbox now and review this movie. 'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven.|1
This is a VERY good movie . I give it a 10.It 's very different in that it 's kind of a surprise, but when you think about it ,I think that there's a great story that has just come to the end and then the next one . It is the beginning of a world where no one knows what's to do.It 's so nice to see how we are doing.We are now getting back to what was originally . Well, it's not just the story , but the movie itself , it's the way a story works .|0
Of the thousands of movies I 've seen so far , this is the first one which made me think about what I can't do with my hands. I have heard it said many times that if a guy has no hands they won't be able to play anything on the television, and if they use it at all the game will be impossible. In fact this is a common thing. I've played it a number of times , when a guy's hand was in my lap I couldn't get the hand out. The second one is quite the opposite.|0
I ca n't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website ! Have I been on the wrong end of a track ? I am not saying the score isn't accurate ( I don't even know how to find a track, I have my own track) but it's not necessarily what I have seen or heard. It could have been a typo, or the score itself was wrong but I don't see it as an issue. So, if you don't believe me and check out the scores at IMDb.org you'll find that it is not the case.|0
"OK , so I got ta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for the first time though

This is one of the last movies of the season so far. This one was pretty great but I have no idea why this could be so damn funny. Here's why: I like the acting, and that's what i've seen for a few years now. The dialogue, character design, and casting are all really great and if you want to get into a comedy of some sort you have to be really creative."|0
The opening scene really got me into watching the movie . However , not more than 5 minutes later , this is where I had my first look . I am going to try and leave some details out for you. I have been following this website and I have used your site and the images that I have seen on it . You can check the image for yourself here . It may be worth mentioning this that I am going to have a look at the images and I am not going to write anything about it .|0
This is a decent movie. Although little bit short in time for me, it packs a lot of action, grit, commonsense and emotions in that time frame. Matt Dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie. The emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie. It is not typical fancy expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price. My evening was great because of this movie. This movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting, story and directing. I would recommend this movie.|1
"One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that mass media - especially television - is usually about four years behind 'underground' media, primarily music. Many people think the 'Woodstock Generation"" remained important throughout the 1970s; actually, it was all over at Altamont in 1970. By 1972, 'underground' rock or the 'counterculture' had moved east to England and Led Zepplin, Black sabbath, and David Bowie, early metal-heads and the so-called 'glam-rockers,' who were all 'peace and love' - not."|1
Do n't get me wrong this was fun to watch . It has some nice animation with exception of an animation and some nice colors . But I don't want to change this . But what I really wanted was the animation . It makes my screen white . But when I do it I still have white screen . But when I change it I like how it looks . but when I change it I don't like the color of the color . But when I change it . But I think my animation is perfect . but I still don't .|0
I was once a big Olsen fan. I received this movie when I was six and watched it almost nonstop until I was nine. Then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. I was left speechless.Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend Spring Break in Paris with their ambassador grandfather. Along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute French boys who show them the more fun side to Paris. I guess the two boys were okay, fake French accents aside.|1
We all enjoyed the movie. It is a very charming family film with many fun cameos. It was fun to see Austin musicians, Charlie Robison, Joe Ely and Robert Earl Keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good. The west Texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit far fetched to me, however, my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him.|1
"With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie . Well , it is a little funny, but I don't really see how it plays out. Anyway, I do believe it would be a good movie for a comedy book, and I'm not a big fan of movies. But, it is still funny and a great one to read. The book is called “Dedication: The Story of a Hero,” and it has many of the things I think you should know, such as:

1) It is the story of David’s career."|0
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski 's trilogy , it seems obvious that, as we have seen, he is a realist in these matters. One can easily understand his work in general, but I do not find anything remarkable about his work when it comes to the 'truth' of Kieslowski in this chapter. As he puts it in his introduction, Kieslowski’s ‘realist’ writings are always ‘objectivity’ , as opposed to ‘reality’ , which would mean that the 'truth' of his work can never be understood without an interpretation of it.|0
If you thought this is the french The Mummy and if you 're hoping for another `` Vidocq '' ..., you're wrong. You've heard about the German version of the script but you've failed to grasp the gist. You need to know a thing or two about the source. You've not been paying attention to how this script is structured, you've been reading a few sections, so you know how it looks, but you've never been able to tell the difference between ``` and `` and what it does.|0
"The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan. After breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the ""key to the universe"" that a tenth convict who didn't break out told them about. Along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well. Each has their own dreams. For much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy. All of the actors give great performances."|1

"`` Problem Child '' was an okay movie , but did it really merit a sequel ? I do n't have the problem that '' was the sequel.

There are some great songs on the album, and the songs are great, and i could be wrong, but i prefer the music of '' and '' for my enjoyment."|0
It 's not really about wine . No , Nossiter 's real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the environment. Wine is an asset , and is not an end goal of a wine club. It's a very serious issue for our wine business. Wine is what we produce, a luxury wine.

Wine is the best wine, I think, the most exciting thing about it that I can see. Q.|0
"It's complete nonsense. I've studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the ""parallels"" use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 1/3 of the planet. It's crafted for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and nonsensical logic.Who made this hit peace? Easy.When all is said and done; Que Bono? That is, who benefits, in the long run?You don't. You sacrifice money and rights."|1
"Okay, now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from. I do believe they can be traced back to this movie. ""Scene Of The Crime"" feels more like a TV episode, or an episode of a serial. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie dull as I'm not a fan of the genre."|1
The 1980's 'My Dinner with Andre,' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005's 'You Are Alone' demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul. The story revolves around three principal characters. There's Daphne, a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same personae.|1
1931 also presented `` an American tragedy '' , the original tale of `` who will he take up with his fellow men and help to make the world his own and not that of those who live in the dark.'' He died in 1876, and his legacy has been lost to history. But his legacy was the cause of a change, in the American culture, of people who live in a dark place. The story of America in its darkest times is a good one and a good story of humanity in the dark places.|0

Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Source's personal assassin, Shax. Whilst Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows for a spell to vanquish Shax, Prue and Piper are attacked by Shax and chase him into the street. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by a news reporter and her cameraman using their powers and broadcasted live on national television. With Phoebe in the Underworld, Prue, Piper, and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage done.|1
this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. I've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. This show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. I dislike that crap..i have no IQ why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. The 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. I seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up.|1
This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary, and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie, it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie, and despite this, I must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No, the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been, but the plot is what really gets you.|1
I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life, but none are coming to mind right now. Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that Tarantino brought back, and did right, in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story is garbage and so is character development. How many movies does Bishop think he can blatantly steal from? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air gun in No Country, etc. etc. Speaking of Bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie?|1
"Some movies you watch and you say, ""Well, that made no sense."" And you don't really mean it. You're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical. ""Bread And Circus"" makes no sense at all. And I mean it. And that's not because it's surreal. From the start, it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. There's no script. There's no plot. There's no story of any kind. One event does not lead to the next -- that's how fundamental the bad writing is here.So what?"|1
This film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.Even little things like Flynn licking one stamp after the other, if they do not fall on the same day, might not be remembered to anyone.There is no need for such a film to show up, as the world’s information is being kept from anyone but anyone but those who know the facts about Flynn and his career, and there are no new fakes on the Internet. But the main question that’s worth pondering here is how much of this information is real?|0
A real let down, the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for TV movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick gushes over it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this one. Stacey Keach is too soppy as Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies TV spin off, of Planet Of The Apes.|1
An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment , so he has a collection of books, papers, drawings, pictures , music, and so much more . The bedroom is made out of a wooden framework of the same length , so it is not as light as one would expect it to be . But what makes this bedroom so different from the other one ? And if it is light , then why does it come out so light ? Do it belong to someone who has lived in the past ?|0
... but had to see just how bad it could get . The plotline was thin to begin with , but it took a long time to draw the lines, and it was finally over at the end. The climax is set for June 17, but it won't be in its glory. The show starts on July 15, and it seems like it'll end this year, so I'm guessing the show is just about as long as we're expecting to see it right now. If you want to know why you were given this title, you'll find out in an upcoming post.|0
I feel terribly sorry ! Where the Lubitsch-pic was enchanting , marvelous , full of spirit and elegance , this is one of my favorite and most beautiful paintings on canvas. I am very fond of this one and admire it for the very first time ! ?????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ?????? ??????? I also like the beautiful colors which I think are beautiful by nature !|0
This is another Sci-Fi channel original movie staring Rhys Davies where its hard to decide whats worse, the acting, or the writing/directing/producing (John Sheppherd helms all three. )Basic story: obsessed exobiologist captures chubacabra monster,smuggles it in a cargo container aboard a cruise ship it escapes and the blood bath begins. Clichéd sci fi cast of the sturdy captain with the beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls in a terrorist alert for the ship (since of course wouldn't believe a monster story. )No dramatic Helicopter drop of the Navy Seals here.|1
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. I am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. Simply brilliant!|1
This movie was everything but boring. It deals with reality. To the people who think this movie was boring, open your eyes to the real problems in our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor,and i deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people and leads to serious brain damage,all kinds of health problems, and death.|1
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. The story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened. Half the scenes are pointless. There is not an inkling of character development. The score/soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. I'm glad I only rented the movie yet I still feel cheated. Avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances.|1
Heh ... I 'm surprised this movie still exists in any form , let alone it being available for rent or viewing at the movies screen . I think it might be one of many such movies and there are definitely some that would make for some good viewing experience . But, I would love to have seen this movie before it died out . The first few minutes were awful. But when the final shot was released in early October I got very happy about it and I knew I wanted to see it more then anything else .|0
"I 've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago but I still have a few more ideas for the sequel:

I wanted to write the characters and be able to do this movie a lot so I wanted it to be a little different, so the first thing that I'm gonna do now is to have a different story with the characters. I'm not an animator or a cameraman but I use this script and the characters to create the story and then the scenes that we've made together."|0
I was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on . While not as bad as it once was, it sure wasn't very good , but that was probably because I was so bored . . . and so tired of it . . . and so bored . . . but then I was watching the show on the internet and suddenly I was sitting on a little table with a nice table top and a book on one side, and then I looked at the computer and realized the screen was blank , just like the TV screen . . .|0
As Muppet movies go, this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age, a solid script, and some great Disneyesque songs, and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Henson's talent. The story is basic, and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed, without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable.This is simply fun, but it is also a well made, well written, beautifully endearing classic.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.|1
OK , I saw this film through Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but I did see the movie , so I saw it again. I did not even watch it at the time, so I don't know what happens next. Maybe it will be good for us in the near future, or perhaps not. But I feel like I should just wait, so to say . . . , but for the moment . . . but for the moment! I'm thinking of going to a movie theater. I'm thinking of going to a theater and watching some of my favorite movies there.|0
I've been a fan of Larry King's show for awhile, I think he does a terrific job overall and I don't think he ever 'wusses' out, as so many people seem to believe. He's a subtle Scorpio, he gets his zings in when he needs to, just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton, during her first post-jail TV interview.The thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was a too-harsh sentence (and what's more, actually MADE her serve it) .|1
To put it simply, this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. Overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. After a while, i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed-up anal retentive.And, this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out, blue-steel-greyishness. Hmmm, the last time i checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors.|1
There are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst. Saw is just that.The movie is simply bad on all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and I cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen.The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with plot holes. The beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility.|1
"The prior comments are way to generous . This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic . On the other hand , . I have been searching all over, but finally came up with this video. There are lots of other movies out there , so I am going to share here . This movie is one that I have been looking at all these days . In it is a few things:

a) You will never get lost in this world and will never have too much pleasure

b) When you see a person doing something, you may think it is a great movie ."|0
This film requires a lot of patience. Because it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in Frances Austen's (the Sandy Dennis character) apartment. But the film builds to a disturbing climax.The characters create an atmosphere rife with sexual tension and psychological trickery. It's very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the trademark Altman audio style is evident here and there. I think what really makes this film work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis.|1
This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno ( Alex Linz ) in a catholic school who turns into a man who believes in God. And this man thinks that God is a bad thing, that all things have to have their own meaning in order for all people to experience God. But that's not what happened because of the film. So let us see how things work. Let's do this for a minute... and let me add a couple more of my favorites that are already here.|0
`` The Moon Is Blue '' director Otto Preminger tackled even more taboo subject matter in his controversial 1955 release ''Falling Skies''. The documentary'' was directed by German director Eisler. ''Falling Skies,'' which was released in the USA by Columbia Pictures, was made as a live film directed by Eisler. It was also produced and released in Germany and Austria, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Belgium and Japan. In Germany, ''Falling Skies'' was nominated for the Academy Award in the category of best documentary, best picture and best feature.|0
Would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word `` STUPID '' on the front page of the local news website?'' This question was answered by @Lorena's answer. A couple weeks ago, I made a mistake. My blog is no longer available at this time. It was posted to my blog, on a different blog, and has been closed in case that the original question is not answered yet. I have not been able to see the link or reply to my comment yet. The question was closed.|0
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released . All these years later at 12:30 on February 23, 2009, this new movie looks to be a very different kind of movie. The new movie comes out every time we see a movie. It was one of the most important movie trailers of all time and has had a huge impact on us all the way through the development and make up in terms of the film itself. Now the movie itself has been released on DVD and the soundtrack is available on DVD.|0
"...""Flight of the Living Dead"" sports production values that belie the substandard script from director Scott ""I'm a producer, can'tcha tell?"" Thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because I feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. Apparently actually shot on film, this direct-to-DVD release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already.Despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like Richard ""Three O'Clock High"" Tyson, Erick ""Stargate"" Avari, and Raymond J."|1
Bad . Bad . Bad . Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot movie-goers. The best way to describe it was as bad, but at least it was entertaining and entertaining at times. So, it's got to be a pretty bad movie. So what did you get? Well, here's the short list of things to do. First, let's get our list of activities we've been doing. As we said, we're not trying to convince anyone to watch that movie.|0
With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot.|1
Lucio Fulci, a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety, ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in Touch of Death, a made for TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts.Starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw, mincing machine and hungry hogs, Touch of Death starts promisingly enough, but Fulci soon loses control of proceedings, introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed 'comedic' scenes.|1
"Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting ""whitey"" with his army of hot kung-fu mama's."|1
"The sort of ""little"" film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. Sort of a ""soul"" version of the more well-known ""The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells"". Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group, and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes, as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas."|1
I find this film meretricious , tentative , lethargic , and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid . . . The film is the last that I have read to be about the character who is the leader in his own right. I can't help thinking he's the only character in all the other films I have seen. The movie itself is not what it used to be . . . it's more of the other film I've watched that you can read on my website. . . . And what about the character himself? How's he doing?|0
'Carolina Moon' is an adequate made-for-TV movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town whereshe grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered. Turns out that every year on the same date anotheryoung girl is murdered and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it, ably supported by the rather delicious Oliver Hudsom and a still luminous Jacqueline Bisset.|1
"Based on a fairly bland ""best seller,"" this film - like most other Lifetime movies - played out more like a reenactment than an actual movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter wasn't in it. The women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad.The characters in this were all cliché and one-dimensional. The story was of the cheesy nature. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great."|1
"No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real ""encounter"" specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead ""Sadhu Agashe"" has killed"" - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory."|1
I found the Movie very interesting . I really enjoyed the film the actors were great . It was entertainment , but also good to have some fun with the cast . The audience was not very good , but that's the way I think they were. Good to know that he will be returning to the series. I would love to see him return to the series , so I would definitely be checking it out, and then if you like what you see in the trailer , then you can keep it in your mind for an hour before the next season (if you liked this one or not ).|0
Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him.Okay Our Gang comedy works in fits and starts. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down.|1
I haven't laughed this much in a long time - or seen a film so ineptly made! Talk about so bad it made me laugh!Firstly, I estimate that for about 40 percent of the film's length, I couldn't tell what was happening, or indeed even what I was seeing. I can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets LSD. There are whole segments, minutes long, where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable stuff.|1
Unfortunately a boring flick , and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg Public Domain version . In the end, this is all that happened. A few days ago I took a quick shower and walked to the kitchen to make sure everything was good. It was so hot, I just kept my hands off of the shower curtain to look at it. Today I went home and took a shower before doing all that cooking and cleaning. It was getting dark and I thought about going into my bedroom, and it made me think that I might have been dreaming.|0
The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. Jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor, Washington's is OK, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. Somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity. The plot is lame. The only thing I liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims. Technical details are worse than the most far-stretched CSI 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility. (Some Spoilers hereafter!)|1
As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome?|1
The only reason I am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie . This was also because of one other reason which was that it was supposed to go on and off for a bit. The movie went on and off for only a few seconds and then went to a halt for several seconds . This makes it impossible to watch the movie in real life for the entire time of the movie . The movie ended up going on and off for around one hour and one minute , then ended up coming back for several seconds .|0
I really love this movie . It has a very real feel to it . I believe it was never intended for this kind of movie , so to make that a bit less than it is now . This was my first impression in the past year and it was really interesting . I would love to work on this project . The story is really well done and makes me want to get my own project . It is just so great and really interesting . I can't wait to finish it! I would love to do this project . Thanks for the very interesting post.|0
"I won't spoil it for you. Although you probably could care less if it was spoiled (you'll know what I mean after you watch it) Poor story. B-rated movie quality. Typical horror -stupid situations- rare timing. I should of known, when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add ""quotes"". Just tells me that the movie bombed big time. And they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb. I wish I could take back the time I spent watching this."|1
"The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about Brazilain street kids whose families live in poverty and must steal and kill to survive. In fact the main character (Pixote) was played by an actual street kid only 11 years old. What follows was one of the most brutal, depressing and horrifying film I've even seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double bill with ""Black Orpheus"") and have never forgotten it. I don't think I ever want to see it again--it was just too much."|1
Now, I love bad, old skifee movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get. The thing has no actors, and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore. There are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid. The only thing not wasted was paper...the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long. Surely no one actually WROTE dialogue this pointless.|1
What can I say about this movie , it really is one of the worst gay themed movies , ever! Its not that I hate it . I like it even more than the movie but not because it is just me . It has no sex scenes , they were just sex scenes with a girl and the movie is a sexual story . It is not even a film , we just want it to be a good thing . If you want to see this movie then you will like to watch it and feel the excitement. The sex scenes were sex scenes in the movie .|0
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure, the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish, in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.But Man is not a bird. Life draws up its own rules, from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort.|1
Irvine Welsh 's follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh , all with a message that shows how an artist has been in the dark for over a year. It’s a great read, as there’s some interesting ideas on this one that will make me want to give it a try, but I thought it was interesting. I’m just really curious, though, to see which of them are worth reading aloud. First, I’ll be getting the full text of all the stories I wrote.|0
...and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.Its a kind of mix of, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. This was made when Molly was still a brunette, just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink.I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an edge! If anyone has a copy of this, or knows where I can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.|1
I had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds ( probably left over) in my hair. The film didn't make sense yet and it's the only time that it did make sense. If you are using this as an example, then I hope it will help a lot of people that don't have that problem. I am not sure that's possible with the film, so please tell me why if it made sense. If it made sense, then you know what I am talking about.|0
"When I first saw this show i thought to my self `` What is this ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <div class=""col-lg-12""> ... </div>
      </td>

    ... But my app works perfectly, it just adds two div's and then it goes on to do all the work, but when I run the app, it says that app is disabled and it should stop working properly. So I'm pretty lost and can't make this any clearer as I have no clue how to fix this problem."|0
"My two daughters (ages 11 and 13) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this movie last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this movie was. David Duchovny was very appealing as the male lead and Minnie Driver gave her usually competent performance. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny - especially one scene Minnie Driver has with a fellow ""transplant"" donee. I liked the fact that it was a movie that I could watch with my children and I wasn't embarrassed by any scene whatsoever."|1
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her, but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman. She epitomized strength, will power, confidence and resolve. She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an amputee, and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary.|1
"The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (which translates into: ""Game-Dancing Machine""). The word is not used in the dictionary but in the sense that it has some meanings in its meaning. For example, ghilli in the dictionary of languages would be translated as a wooden game device. It can also be applied in games as well, as a wooden or musical instrument (which means that a game is built around it). Ghilli-Danda, a Germanic name meaning ""the musical instrument or instrument"" is also a Germanic word for game-playing."|0
Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived. Haines displays his easy, goofy comic persona as he takes on West Point and Joan Crawford, the local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And amazingly touching after Haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new, humility-filled Haines get s alast-minute reprieve to play in the bill football game against Navy and, despite a broken arm, wins the game. Great, rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film, shows Billy at his best.|1
Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist? I'm not sure, but I think I've been able to understand why movies exist at all. That's the question I ask in this video. It's really not a great question, even if I think I'm wrong. If you go into the movie to see if it is better than other movies that I've ever seen, it's probably not the movie I wanted to watch, because it's not the film that I'd been hoping for.|0
A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). The movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. Even the gifted Tommy Lee Jones does not manage to salvage this BOMB. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed Hollywood.The two stars are given solely to the CGI-people and the PR-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it.|1
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada -- particularly in Quebec . That 's because there have always been people who have had concerns that they might not want to go on and on about things. They would not be happy that they couldn’t get a proper review right out of the gate. But that could happen if there were people who wanted to get a good review, and if that review was something they had to find out about, then they weren’t willing to go on and on about some things, but they were willing to pay attention to the film.|0
I can't believe this movie has 6 stars on IMDb. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen that wasn't an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The plot is predictable. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. The dialog is cheesy. Several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges' accent is goofy - I can't tell what country he's supposed to be from.|1

can someone please help me i missed the last view moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole film again. i got to just where they are in the train carriage and she says 'what about that drink now?' and smiles. what happens after that? is there anymore dialogue or action? surely it doesn't just end there? i was a bit bored in the film and kept hoping it would get better. i love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the UK TV series she was in about some nuns? i am wanting to know the name.|1
"For those that might send me nasty e-mails , shove it . There is a trend in Hollywood where those people can get more out of the way. I don’t want anyone to think I’m stupid. And that trend may seem to be going somewhere, even though I’ll never see it happen. I’ll keep trying. On a side note, here is a post I wrote that is a response to:

"One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and Judgement Day. This film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy -- there is only the standard British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs.Actually, good candidates for a real Third Testament have been published several times - like ""A Course in Miracles"" or ""Conversations with God""."|1
"Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks, I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger over the pause/play button. At the end of any age group's lesson, simply devote 5 minutes to pausing and playing the DVD, encouraging students to shout out the answers to ""What's this? "", ""What will happen? "", ""What's happening? "", ""What's wrong? "", or any other question that elicits responses from that lesson's new vocabulary and grammar.Because everyone's looking at the TV, normally shy students become vocal."|1
I am so excited that Greek is back! This season looks really eventful. Im glad that Casey is trying to get serious about school but is still involved in the sorority. Its really funny that she wants to go into politics & that they're highlighting her 'scheming talent.' I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They should shave Cappy's head, as well. All the guys are hot but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I cant wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam, & Rusty!|1
Don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. It has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking Bugs, and some nice music. And the standout scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy's dance on the floor, that was such a nice and fun touch. As a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what I call exceptional like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much that I would deem hilarious.|1
Yes, thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie. The acting is below-average and the special effects are horrible. In fact, the worst i have ever seen. It is a very low budget movie. There is no way this movie will can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. Mr. bone eater was more of a funny creature for me. It could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget. The movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol.|1
Simply put , Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable . The movie is less about the raw science of science fiction than it is about religion, religion and science. And I want to end with a quote from the movie, which is something that I would like to hear about more often. The first time it made me laugh I thought, this is funny. I had to laugh. It was funny, but it made me cry. It made me fall asleep. I didn’t do the joke, I told myself, or I would never do the joke.|0
"This amusing, sometimes poignant look at the Hollywood detective genre of the 1940's and 1950's stars Robert Sacci as an unnamed former cop who retires, uses his life savings to pay for plastic surgery to transform his image into that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, then sets up shop as a private eye under the name ""Sam Marlowe"". Robert Sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare few Bogart impersonators who got the lisp exactly right; more to the point, the body and facial language are there."|1
"I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of ""Grand Champion"" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the movie. I have been in the Photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 movies and I can't think of a time when I enjoyed providing my craft more. The Kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy she's a real trip. She even grabbed one of my camera during the stockshow scene rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her images were used for PR."|1
1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Mark Dindal ) : Fast-paced , frantic animation effort by Ted Danson and Mark Wahl . In the 4-4/5/6 animation, it is possible to capture a scene with 3D objects, with each object appearing as the scene progresses. With this animation, you can capture the scene as you move forward in your scene. 4 out of 10 ( Dan Sreenick ) : An interesting animation is the fact that both of the first and the last frames are also 3D. In the 8-9/10 second frame, you are facing an object in the scene.|0
DO N'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the inside. When I was five and I got up from my bed and went to work for two days, my mother told me that I didn't have the patience to drive myself to school. And what would you do with all these years that I could have left? There's a lot of information I can use to help me get my bearings. If you haven't already, here's a simple example: If I drive my own car I can have all the fun I want.|0
Also titled -- > The Magical Castle -- > This one is a stretch . Why bother ? Why create a magical castle for a friend of mine ? And who is this person? Well, because we want to make people feel better about ourselves, and it is very much a part of the process of bringing people together. So, we wanted to create a group that has people of different backgrounds. That's right. People who have different backgrounds, who have different interests, who are different at different points in their lives.|0
"Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve."|1
Ben Marshall , a teen ager from a religious background , is made aware about the financial situation at home, as his parents are trying to raise enough money to buy a new car that they think will be the last of his money. He’s still in college and says that he will take care of his family in a future life, so that he’ll pay his bills. However, that doesn’t mean that the financial situation has not changed in his case, as he can’t take care of his family anymore now.|0
The book is great . It 's one of my favorite books ever . The film , on the other hand, isn't much better . The book is one of the best . The DVD , on the other hand , is a terrible . The film and the DVD is one of my best and worst . This DVD is the worst that I've seen . The film is the worst of the last few years . I just watched this movie , and I don't know if that is the best or worst part of it?|0
I 've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80 's and it's pretty funny. It's a very funny film and it made me think about my childhood when it was made, and as I remember, I remember having a bad day at school when I was only 2 when it was made. I remember watching the film that night. I didn't watch it again. What's the most entertaining part of the movie? The film itself is fantastic. It was really good and it made me take a bit of credit for it.|0
"When i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. WRONG! There was NO suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs! When i was done watching this i had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through ""the motions."" i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it."|1
"Alright! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! As with any Wynorski-flick, he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. But ""Storm Trooper"" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere)."|1
"I loved so much last Bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece ""L'Ora di Religione"". It had a great screenplay, great actors (well, have to say Castellitto is so much greater than others), a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography.Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. Ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals (and we could speak weeks about politics, you know we are italians...). Poor cinematography (it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do some efforts more peoples!!!!)."|1
Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire . It 's not a hallmark of cinema - and it could be very bad. If you can 't see what's on the other side, then go to the movie website where you 'll find the latest film releases, trailers, reviews and videos. But I'm not giving you the time to try and prove it, so be warned: you're going to go crazy. If you like, look on the left-hand side and see what they've put on a box that has nothing to do with what is in the film.|0
"Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I hadn't known that I would have staked my life that the director was Brian DePalma . Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams "" Depalma , DePalma , Depalma ""Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans Hitchcock over the years Russell should have tried emulating a style of his own ."|1
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I don't think so.What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.Where to start? Okay..1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.2) No ricochet.|1
"Down Periscope is not a `` Great Movie '' . But then again very few flicks are . So if you want to see it as the original, go for it. A:

You will find a few interesting facts about this movie, as well as some others that have come from other sources. 1. There are some good reasons to go ahead and do your own research. For example, many of your movies use a different set of rules, not just the basic ones. 2. You will also find that it's easy to understand and use in your own experience."|0
Satya was excellent.... Company was just as good but more polished, probably owing to the money earned from previous movies. Ab Tak Chappan however is even more entertaining. The dialogue is gritty, crude and at times hilarious. Nana Pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented. Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax. As a depiction of reality it may be over-dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot-on.|1
It looked cool from the movie sleeve , but after five minutes we were n't sure if it was a cut and paste. It looked really nice to look at , but now that it's in my hair I don't like this. I'm definitely going to get a lot of people to come to the store and buy this because it looks really nice to me. I have to say, it does look nice to me. I also like the look and the color of this hair color and the hair texture. A lot of it is very natural.|0
Yeah, I know my title sucks. I couldn't think of any other title. x] Ice is a brilliant first season episode. Very interesting idea and good acting as well. The whole worm-looking-thing was really creepy in my opinion. I've never been a fan of insects, so all the insect episodes are creepy to me. x] Anyway, lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode,The Good: The parasite thing. Awesome!Scully finally trusting Mulder. Awww... <33It was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear.|1
.... OK , small-town , clueless sheriff ? Check . Sheriff 's hot daughter ? Check ? Ne'er-do-well boyfriend of one of the children ? Oh wait , i have nothing to complain about in that town . How old are they? I have to go to the grocery to pay for my food , I'm a little tired of going out there . How many people do you have to get to see for themselves? What do you want from them, anyway? They're the same age as you and yours , why can't we talk about this now?|0
Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch. Kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick (named Trigger Hicks! ), but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. Constantly-smiling Robert Young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes Trigger's first crush...but alas, he's married! No amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula, based on a play and brought to the screen by R.K.O.|1
"Jack Lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen. He could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. While his performance in ""Save The Tiger"" is Oscar-worthy, I feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one.This is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member."|1
"Deepa Mehta's ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative, upper middle class Indian households, this is a film no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together, they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support."|1
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I was wondering if anyone else could share their love of comedy and comedy. I thought it would be interesting to find out about their recent comedy sketches. I was sure they were going to write something funny. I’d also been curious if anyone could tell me how to find a list of a few of the greatest comedians in the world. I wanted to know how to look at all of their sketches and if they had any other ideas of what they wanted to write.|0
This movie strayed too far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. Barely made it to the middle of the film. Besides changing Don Wanderly from Edwards nephew into his son, the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was trash. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the Chowder Society members either. Hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime.|1
What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster ? Not that much . With the average film about a gangster , it’s quite a bit. So, the question is, how is this movie being made? It’s a good example to look at the big picture at its best. First of all, the main character is a serial killer, which means the film is making the story of the gangster into a story about how to bring the killer down. It doesn’t make sense.|0
"Awesome Movie ! Great combination of talents ! I 'm a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding! :-P

This is a great movie, I can 't wait to hear about it! It's one of my favorite movies you've read in a few years, but it sure can't go down without a gander! What are you waiting for? It's a really good movie for anyone interested in a great movie! Also, it's the only single movie I've ever done that can be watched with my eyes closed!"|0
I loved this movie but then again I am a big Cronenberg fan . If you have not seen a movie before it, you must have missed it! And I really like the movie. It’s great and I don’t see myself doing it as a fan. The only thing I didn’t like about the movie, but I have enjoyed it over the last 10 years and that’s fine. In my opinion, the movie has a lot of merit. It’s one of the most important movies to watch this time, I think.|0
"Like all of the very earliest films , this `` movie '' is very , very short -- lasting about 2 seconds, to be exact. It consists of two main episodes, the first (episode #1) is an hour long, and consists of two episodes. It is the only film ever that has been made for more than 8 hours, but it has been almost completely discarded, because it is too difficult to make movies. This is the first ""movie'' movie that I've made for more than 8 hours. I know that it is the most important movie of the whole series."|0
"When i went to see this i thought , i liked the first two and thought that they were very much different than the first two. Is there any way that i can get these two to work out so that they will work just like that? A:

I think there are two things that can be done with it. 1)  If you want one and the other to be the same, but you also want to have the first be a different size, you can't use the same number in the first, so you just do the same thing."|0
What a shocker. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it.|1
I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater . Despite its local provenance ( and its relation to the city), this is one of the few theater houses I’ve ever been in with a good story for its location in a Philadelphia neighborhood. I was hoping it wouldn’t go unnoticed, but at least I know it’s happening. I’ve been looking forward to this theater over and over for a while now. A couple of years back, we had another theater to ourselves in the city and that has been my experience.|0
George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great. I've heard the Len Cariou version but it was too tame. George was great in that character - very expressive.Angela Lansbury was perfect for the part. She gave a great performance. She gave the Mrs. Lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story.I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of George Hearn in his songs of rage, vengeance and distress.I've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS.|1
"If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war, you need to see ""Letyat zhuravli"" (called ""The Cranes are Flying"" in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who are in love on the verge of WWII. They are walking along the waterfront, watching the cranes fly by, when the war starts. Boris is promptly sent off to war. Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son, whom she does not love."|1
Ok, everybody agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing off Boone was a bad desicion. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character, if you are over Boone. He is really... mysterious.|1
"BIG FAT LIAR, in my opinion, is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - ""MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE"") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - ""ALL THAT"") played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. As a matter of fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay erroneously ended up in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo."|1
It's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. The dialog was unnatural. Especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. I guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The suspense just wasn't there. The music was about as bad as it gets. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen.|1
"This is a very strange film , with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. However, this is a very good movie, and it’s not really bad either. If you want to try something new, you should read this. If you really like this movie, you can get it here. –

This movie is very interesting because I wanted to give you a few things to look at first. I’ve got no idea about how to watch the film and I do not have a computer , so I want to read it a bit more."|0
`` A research scientist is experimenting with human DNA in an attempt to create the perfect human being . His experiments will not only test if the human gene sequence is unique, they may also help in developing artificial DNA technology to allow researchers to create their own.

The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a `` pod '' system that is almost like virtualization,'' and there is no real solution to this problem. For the most part, there is no doubt that this system has the potential to be so. But that doesn't mean that there's no other way to make it work, and there's only one possible solution. For the game, the system comes with some interesting features, but there is no direct way to go on that. The system only allows you to interact with it.|0
Hehehe. This was one of the best funny road movies ever! I laughed so I fell out of the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities playing themselves. Harald Zwart is the producer, known for films like Agent Cody banks and of course One Night at McCool's.It is about Norwegian crazy fans, going to the world cup in Soccer in Germany 2006. And all sort of crazy fun that comes with it. It was hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. I haven't had so much fun in ages. Rumors say it will come a number two, but I do not know.|1
I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and I've always been a fan of Foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, HATED this movie.Although it does aim to expose the lives of young, lowerclass men in Lima, and to an extent it does succeeed, the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them.Although the story chiefly revolves around M, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is, at best, amazingly dry and dull.|1
Possibly the worst movie I ever saw. The person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light. You can't see anything in this movie. It is way to dark. The parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares. So you still can't see. This movie should have been a radio play or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside-down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can be done so much better then this.|1
This movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything I hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly. That's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon. What?! That's a Rugby ball. The story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football.|1

Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) a coven of witches, again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, preps Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting, plenty of candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time.|1
Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults . Overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the death of the human and the death of the person . How many people are there that would be able to cope with life at any hour without having to face death? I believe there are a number of people that can do anything that is possible to do but they are most probably not going to be able to cope at all . You may be able to do so without having to make decisions . But, I don't want to make decisions at any time.|0
` The Last Frontier ' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed Wootton, his son-in-law Frank and his daughter Margaret. The novel is well-conceived by the book-loving fans and has a pleasant storyline, as is the first time I encountered it. The Last Frontier is the first book of its kind and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a refresher on English literature, but I can't recommend it to anyone with an appetite for English literature, even those with a penchant for westerns.|0
One of the reviewers here wrote : `` Good acting , good special effects , greatlocation . Even better ending. ... But in the end it all still stands there. In the end I wanted more and I couldn't give up. But I think the most important thing in the end is to be able to put the ending in context and to think of it as well.'' On another note, the author seems to think this is an interesting idea. Is this true ? Or is it the case that this kind of thing is better than just sitting in front of a computer?|0
I too saw this film at a film festival , but unlike the previous poster I found it both interesting and funny. There are many great films and I was always surprised with how much I liked it. I like to think about the movie a lot because it is about people and sometimes I really do like seeing it. The characters are funny, they make a great audience and are great for seeing how the movie plays out. This film was good at making the audience and the cinematography was brilliant, the dialogue is good and the story is funny and you will feel like you know what is to come.|0
Admirable but weak James Bond film mainly because both the hero ( Bond ) and villain ( Blofeld ) were created in this manner. Bond's villain is a dark villain that uses his powers to do the right thing. In Bond's first film the villain is just as bad as the hero. When you consider James Bond's films, you'll also see that he is not only a villain, and that he uses his powers in a violent way to be in the right sort of situation, but also uses them more than the hero.|0
"Though I have watched Salò, I do not know if excrement tastes tart. If it does, this ""film"" is accurately titled. So much of roughage, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate. It leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth, and if I could vomit this film and get back that expanse/expense I would. Detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a dunce cap, and the Spirit of Ed Wood Jr. couldn't save this semi-professional projection from certain failure."|1
"""The Apartment Complex"" is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student (Lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery...um, if you can call it that. This low cal watch contains no suspense, no thrills, no drama, no action, precious few funny moments, a dash of nudity, and almost no romance. ""The Apartment Complex"" is passable, forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes."|1
If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors , eating non-ants , and conquering the world with them, then this will have a big impact. Of course, there are people who will probably be a little worried about the amount of work you can do when using this kind of image, so you should probably do some reading before you use it. But if you really REALLY LIKE it, you could learn some interesting things about ants in your book, too. And if you are reading it, you can find more info on this page in this blog.|0
Honestly , on the subject of the death penalty , I could take it or leave it . The problem is , though, is that they do have the right , and the only way for this to happen is to have a trial on it by a jury . How does it look if you take the case and say , , you go into court and try to convict or go into prison , the judge has to give you two years before you get the death penalty . That is a huge issue , you are in court to be convicted of any crime , you are in prison to get the death penalty .|0
"I love Umberto Lenzi 's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT'S HEARTS. He stars in his favorite movies of the '80's, such as MIRACLE TO THE OCEAN. His best-known movie is CITRIX, with a sequel to his own work as a cop -- it is not his only movie. (He is also a member of the ""Rome Uno"" crew -- and I think he has the potential for ""Rome,"" but that is not his most important movie to watch, so that may be an interesting topic for some.)"|0
If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs , I 'm sure it would sound like a great thing to them , but if they have a budget of some kind , then it could be even better. I can 't tell you what they will be, but I can tell them that this will have to go on a long term basis if the project is to succeed. It just seems like a logical thing to do . But if it comes from a financial standpoint, I'm not sure I believe it.|0
"Another decent offering from the pen of Vince Gilligan.A pre- '' Malcolm in the Middle '' Bryan Cranston plays Patrick McConaughey on ''The Oatmeal''. He is, he says, a ""dude"". ""He's such a good guy. He can give you an opinion about who is a good guy to have, and a good guy is the person who is very good at who he is,"" McConaughey said. ""There's no question he can.

25 August 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen:Sean Connery is one of the all time greats and I have been a fan of his since the 1950's. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. The movie surprised me quite a bit. The scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst. Why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery.|1
"If you feel Reshammiya as the singer is too much of a pain to watch on TV , try watching his most recent songs on Youtube or any other Youtube channel to learn more. This is because many of his songs have been played on TV and in some cases have been played by the audience. The only songs you might want to check off of Youtube is the song ""Kodaka"", which is played by the popular TV series ""Nets"" that has been released in March 2019. His songs are not easy to watch."|0
I like Arnold , and I love the subject matter , but this was a very disappointing movie . When I was told that I was not expecting a sequel I said no. The reason for my surprise was because this movie is a lot more entertaining than the first , but it is a shame that I never got a sequel to it . And this movie was so boring . So I really think you have to give this movie a lot of thought . Also, this movie does not disappoint me, and it does have a ton of fun .|0
Low budget mystery . A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. 2:00 PM. A police officer shows up on the street, but they haven't been seen since Saturday morning. 3:00 PM. Police say a man walks in to an abandoned home. The man pulls a gun and is seen firing. He then turns around and sees the officer holding a gun. As he approaches, the officer pulls the trigger and the gun is in his hand. After the officer pulls out the gun, the guy is shot and he is bleeding.|0
A recent re-issue of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now comes in the US in a gorgeous new print from The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses. Later Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri.|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriend . It was a total disaster . You can really see it was one of those days in which everyone was looking to go home to their loved ones but only one of us would actually get home and they would have to spend all day in the living room with my boyfriend to be there . It just was the one time when I really wanted to go home, I didn't feel I wanted to do it because I could do it for a day and then when we had to go home again I felt it would never come .|0
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. From the very first time he gets down on his hands and knees, it’s hard to believe that this story is about him at all—the very, very simple thing. But then it becomes a bigger story, and in the middle of that first story, he starts talking about how he was a kid and his parents made him “look like a little boy.” His parents were very upset that he was not raised as a kid, but as a person.|0
Since THE MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution , one should sit back and enjoy the game for a while until they get it right , but you never know what will happen once you play it out. You might think it’s a game which has no answer but it has a lot of answers. If you haven’t already got a answer, I’ll write the answers down. Let me start by explaining the concept of the 3D World. As you know there are many types of objects, they can be represented in many different ways.|0
There are not many films which I would describe as perfect , but Rififi definitely fits the bill . No film which was not perfect . There are still many fine films to watch, but all are well . There are only two that I should mention and two that I don’t want to say in this article, but there are many good films to watch. But there are still many excellent movies to watch, but these are few and far between. They have many good features and there are many bad ones. But as to the good, I will say that many fine films are made for cinema.|0
An under-appreciated , unseen gem . Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant , heartbreaking fashion , the power of imagination , and how it makes us feel. It's the kind of work that helps us see the real-world of the real, and that we can make sense of even if it's just a small piece of information, and maybe even a big piece of information, because we can see it in the context. It’s a little hard to imagine a real world with a real-world mind-set, but one thing to note is that this is not just an art form.|0
"It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for ""The Sopranos,"" as its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all. Everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank got to the reunion I had stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish.It had potential."|1
Just watched Hair after a lapse of 20 years. It struck home. For those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; who resisted the fascism of the Johnson/Nixon administrations; who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in Vietnam every single day until finally the US beast died and fled; for all who said no in many different ways -- it's remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How large the real table was on which Treat danced. How driven the wizard behind the curtain.|1
"The thing which makes `` Fire '' even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry , is its very existence. But you have the power , and you will see it again , you see it . This is why it was created, and why we will always be watching it . As the name suggests, this is how it works :

1. When you create an event, you can create an object that holds the event. You want to create an object which contains the event and is the property of that event. The object you create must have a name that starts with Event ."|0
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish . I knew we were in for a wasted week. As it happens, a few days back I had to work the last few days to get some sleep . The only light from the sun is through the windows of my room . I think this was one of those scenes I have been looking forward to . I thought the light might be getting through the window a bit . And that didn’t happen. I was very pleased that I’d been able to keep the light on in the morning.|0
Teenage Exorcist is one of those God-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. This film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. It is about a girl moving into a house where a Baron de Sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. Her sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon.|1
Well , I did n't know what to expect from 555 . Matter of fact , I had never even seen the show on television before I was there, and it's so nice to meet one of the most popular people on TV that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this . Anyway, it was a pretty cool show, and so nice to meet you , but I'm not really sure if you guys would be surprised to see the show in the first place. Anyway, thanks for that. The show was pretty good though and the dialogue was fantastic.|0
I think the `` Bone Snatcher '' should go after anyone associated with this movie . Watching this will seem like I'm going into some kind of conflict to be able to figure out how to make it appear like that. I've been looking online for about 30 minutes now and I see that it's going to have the same effect as the other two movies in the series and so the movie should have the same problem as the other two movies. Is it just the movie itself which doesn't have any influence, so it doesn't seem to do anything?|0
I saw this movie on a show that was showing bad B-movies and trying to get you to buy them. It basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about. After viewing the trailer, I thought I would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense. IT'S NOT ENTERTAINING in any sense of the word. The film has two (or should I say four) things going for it and it's not the number of deaths, it's the women.|1
I love watching Australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing . The DVD cover looked exactly like the one I was going to buy, with my face in it. If you look closely at the top right-hand page (you'll notice I was right on), you'll notice that the front cover showed my name in it, as did the back cover. Also, I was just trying to make the movie sound nice so I could just put the pictures on it. I'm sorry if that makes things any better, I just hate watching them.|0
Bronson took the money and ran with this film; he must have house payments like me! This low budget film made in Mexico reminds me of a few of those Italians stinkers from over seas. I heard, I do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe this because why else would they make this film, it sure wasn't to make money. We had a whole lot of these Canadian made stinkers, because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry.|1
"This horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where I thought to myself ""this is going to be really good"". However, it gets rather boring rather quick at the end. The acting is fairly good, as is the location and the story starts out rather well too. The problem, not enough kills on screen and an ending where you have the monster basically turning tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was picking up and going to be a winner."|1
Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie. She really acted as though she were Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.I gave this movie an eight rating, but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance.|1
'Be With Me' is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point it'll end. Alas, as I watched it alone, and so I felt like I almost watched the world's worst, longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time I just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled; and I then managed (just a) a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a 'Thank you' to the movie's sponsors - which included Asia Pacific Breweries.|1
Now I did watch this when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. But honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. Sort of a hair metal, Dokken version of Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular Mst3k fodder usually contains. But if it was on cable, and I was bored and drinking beer--sure, I'd watch it again.|1
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about Driving Lessons, but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life.|1
"I think Shane Black is one of the all time greatest action screenwriters ever ! He gave us the awesome idea of creating an animated short film about him that you can read here on his page : http://www.facebook.com/ShaneBlackMovies

Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids. I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great story, and great wit that it is irresistable. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way, he meets Fozzie Bear, The Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf, and DR. Teeth and the electric mayhem.This film has so many good things I can't even say them.|1
"Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I have to disagree on a couple of things. First, this film is nothing like THE CARS THAT ATE Paris. Not IMHO. Nothing like it.I think the film had elements of surrealism, but I think the basic approach of the film maker is not ""surrealist"" per se. therefore its not really like CARS Paris, I think more like a weird Euro work, with some scenes bearing the hallmark of ""wierd"" not surreal.Secondly, I think the music by Heuzenroeder is brilliant."|1
"Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley on the outskirts of Chicago. It’s her place, she told herself, that’ll be hers when you get there! “I know there’s an old lady going through it,” she tells herself. “She knows about me, that’s all. It’s not that easy, really.”

It’s the other half of it. She doesn’t even know the name of the other girl who comes into her life after her birth, though she knows who."|0
"i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local PBS station played while growing up. (got introduced to the doctor by way of John Pertwee)as well as ""camera copies"" of doctor who sent to America by UK fans to their US counterparts. i had a great time w/ the show, but it never seemed to take itself seriously - i mean as seriously as a sci-fi show about a time traveler could be. i went to the CONs, did the costume bit (doctor#5,6 and Tegan were my costume characters), loved it."|1
Okay , I had watched this movie when I was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the house had been so peaceful and peaceful. When I went out for breakfast and watched the movie, I was in shock. It was still the first time I had heard of an alcoholic beverage that was still illegal. That was the only time I knew that I was drinking alcoholic beverages from my parents. It wasn't like I would ever drink alcohol from a glass of ice cream if I were in a class. I think that was something I heard during the night when the movie was filmed.|0
For a really wonderful movie , you could also try seeing the movie about Saint Francis of Assisi - good movie. As you can see in the pictures below, the Saint Francis movie looks very very impressive for the fans. It's just a very small budget and it doesn't include anything like the original movie. It also has some nice extras (like a small camera) that will definitely give you an idea about the character's personality. Also, the film is based off a novel written by Charles Darwin which is based off his observations of the apes.|0
I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. The acting was over the top. The direction was tacky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? He was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. He could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. Then you have Jamie Foxx, who throws like a girl.|1
This movie stars Ben Kingsley as Frank , a hit man for some Russian mobsters based out of Buffalo . The first time we have seen him in action , it was probably around the time Ben Kingsley and I were working on another movie together. The movie itself is a pretty amazing movie with some very interesting characters and a lot of the plot twists which I think would have made a better movie but the ending of the movie is not quite as exciting as the first. I am still not sure if I will post any pictures of that movie here.|0
Nightkill stars Robert Mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn fails to inform Mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts. After all, she was the one who helped her lover James Franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby.What more would expect from a rotten slasher film with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.|1
Well , I have been to a British University , in fact I went to the one in this very city that is one of the world’s most renowned universities , the City University. And of all the institutions that I could go to , the City University was the most prestigious institution in the world. I got a job there as the Assistant Professor. And it was very good, I went to the same one , which was a university in Belgium, which is a large part of Belgium, where I am from, the country.|0
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our Community Cinema, and it got an overall average score of 8.6. We'd 100% recommend it, then, for today's audiences, especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen, and can talk about it with others afterwards, as our audience did.The sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. but everybody was thoroughly well cast.|1
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson 's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit and his muppet characters have been playing for a little over two hours and four minutes in total. It would be nice not to let this time limit drag down the musical comedy act's work. But if it goes, you're not gonna like it! It would be great, as long as you don't have time to play it! I've heard Jim Henson sing several songs but I don't think he ever did the whole thing!|0
This movie is such a fine example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. Oh don't get me wrong, most of the music back then sucked. I only ever liked the metal bands from the 80s. Bands that had some balls. Forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is horrible and I want to die' garbage. But the movies from the 80's are the best. They were all about nonsense and just having a good time. This movie exemplifies that! Party! Get naked! Get laid! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!|1
I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star , because the film has so many eye-rolling lines, it’s very clear to see what you mean and how you might be able to make an impression and make it look cool. And that’s it. I’m just not sure that you can just make a stinker. But at least I wouldn’t judge it just because it is not the same as having a stinker, which is probably why they are in the film. But then there is that second stinker that you don’t really mean.|0
Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare 's classic plays , this version of Hamlet does nothing to reflect the real mood of the audience, especially as there is only a fraction of the audience to hear Hamlet. Even if it were the first version of the play to be filmed on a local TV, this version of the play could be as much of a surprise for the audience as any Shakespeare play. But the BBC could make its own version of Hamlet so they can make the other version of it as good as it's possible for them to give it.|0
Alright ! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg version of what is actually a cyborg and what it should look like! Now I've been watching the final scene and I think this is going to be a great addition to the movie. It's not a plot plot and it's not the action that the first movie was supposed to be. It's still a very, very good movie, but it's in a very very very short time. It's not really good enough to tell it the whole story from start to finish!|0
This movie was , perhaps , one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I 've seen in a long time, but it's probably not a bad movie. You know that feeling. A couple of months back, I stumbled across a post about it, but I have to say, it wasn't the most original story I've heard, but that's ok. The story was written about two guys who had an affair with each other and they had sex. So I decided to look at it a bit more carefully. When I got the post up, I found this post on Wikipedia.|0
I saw this movie once a long time ago, just once, and I didn't know where it had come from, and I looked for about six years to find it, and I finally found it here at IMDb.com! Just the whole concept of the movie is great, I believe it's got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings, keeping tabs on us and our planet, but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity. And the way that he does it,to keep himself from being tracked and located, is what keeps the movie entertaining.|1
Art imitates life imitates art . Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A . in this tragic and suspenseful gripping tale of a young woman's journey to reclaim her memory from her parents' death and be reunited with her memories. I have written about this story recently. It has been told in a variety of forms, not the least of which is a long-winded introduction. But I wanted to give it a brief and easy reading. “It was, by far the best thing that could have occurred to my imagination. It was a very beautiful thing to behold that I could read in a book at that moment.|0
"The ""silver screen"" gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life's rainbows. There's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen, but the film's namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy, humor and lust for life. The story of entertainer extraordinaire Uncle Frank, his devoted wife Aunt Tillie, and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to ""live each day as if it's your last"" and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years. A great movie for young and old audiences!"|1
"This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 min, nothing happens. He only walks to places and gets out..... Like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring ""looks-like-a-suspens"" scenes.Dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lots of ""hello's"" and few ""hang on"" on the 1st part.Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters."|1
Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. Definitely worth checking out. If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while.|1
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar -worthy film?! MOSTHLY MARTHA is MUCH MORE BETTER, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (Martina Gedeck). It's a joke and ugliness with the handsome Aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood. There are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. Isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script? Or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures?|1
Much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to R DOGS made on the DVD cover. Forget about all of that... This film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. How can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? There is no plot, none. I couldn't believe that I spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that I had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential.|1
"Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons , I had hoped that the sequel would be just the opposite. However, I got the following:

This was a lot of work! It's the second installment of Demons, the sequel of the first trilogy. What's going on here? This is just the beginning, and it's the first sequel, and the first Demon of the Year. What a coincidence. The second sequel was the second, and it's the second Demon of the year."|0
"It kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and maybe even more depth concerning political invocations. But then again, most of these are not directed by Peter Watkins. Maybe the one true genius artist of British Film to emerge out of the 1960s, Watkins has made quite a bunch of rarely seen films that perfectly capture the spirit of the outer-aesthetic world - the world of political ongoings, social problems and governmental solutions. Thus, his work is probably less ""filmic"" than, say, political, which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality."|1
"A genuinely creepy ghost story , full of chills and sensuality , this movie just falls short of what it should be . . . The ghost story does not scare me . . . but if you read this book you’ll have a hard time remembering the words that said ” this is not the ghost story . . . I’ve seen ghost stories before . . ."" This is a really interesting movie! It’s creepy, I don’t need to mention that to anyone else, and it was a good read. It also makes me curious about where we live."|0
The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger.Legendary bomb. The idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for 1980s audiences. Right off the bat though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to see the film because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger.|1
Well , after seeing `` Beginning '' I thought why the hell they burned Schraders Version and did that poor guy not know how to do that again? But you're the guy I said I should have done it as soon as possible . . . . I think we can do it ! . . . I think I got it. No. I've been doing this for a while, but now I have to do it this way. What do I do? Oh, no, you're not. There's one thing that I've done for a long time .|0
"Comedy? What's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions (by the time I turned it off) of alchoholics anonymous? Set off by a woeful script of grunts and mumbles and drunken slurrings. Served up with lashings of Hollywood's religious ""God will Save you"" redemption drivel Another Reviewer mentioned the ""Sassy dialogue"" of Tea Leone - well I managed to watch nearly an hour of this boring film and I still haven't seen any sassy yet - in fact my 80 year old grandmother has more amusing comebacks than Tea's character in this rubbish."|1
"I caught this on HBO under its category of ""Guilty Pleasures"", and I would agree that I felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. One, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. Two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn ""who did it"", you think, ""So what?"". However, I must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see Peta Wilson get completely naked a number of times."|1
This movie had potential . If it had been handled differently . What it needed was a different director . That was the case . That's why I wanted to create it . . That's a good thing to do . . You can have an idea for a movie called . And it will turn out great . . How did it end . Now that we're in a movie theater and the story has begun, we get to work . I want to know what the director thought . . What did I do? I wanted to get rid of the camera .|0
This movie was so poorly acted . What was with Jeff Bridges accent , horrible and unbelievable . Was it because I got the role . . . but . . . yes . . . but . . . . I was a little scared . . . . This movie is a really good sequel . . . and I love the sense of humor . . . and so much more! It’s very good . . . The first thing that happened was that the film had a very strong plot , but there was a lot of plot twists and so many surprises .|0
"I was so ""impressed"" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try. It is the near future, post apocalypse of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge The Dark One and his underling Valaria. Along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. Oh my! Sadly, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is hardly up (or down) to HUNT's level."|1
Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you, kid,' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you,' or `I'll be back,' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed.|1
This failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy, if I can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. It's honestly that bad. I view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. Just to be fair, Kelsey Grammar's character has 1 line that almost works, but doesn't quite.|1
If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber , just a look at his new film , The Last Song (2007), they have already revealed to me what was going on with him . I think this film will be a great addition to my collection . Its a true love story. The LastSong is a very different film from his previous works. The story starts with a story about a young woman who is the mother of a man she is dating. He takes her away and has a fight with her husband, which she eventually learns about.|0
For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story. I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.|1
Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot! For the people who say they don't make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to. Well, this one is really hard-core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie. Nicholas Guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show! He really performs as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated.|1
"This was the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. It is a complete waste of money and time. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater- not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie- said ""wow what a good movie."" Someone actually walked out! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with Rick on the ceiling peeing, she had had enough."|1
"OK, it was a ""risky"" move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose.Well, I was wrong. This is, next to ""Bloodsurf"", the worst ""horrormovie"" I have ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad. That is why I give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie..... Do not rent or buy it."|1
I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival . Since I work in the wine business , I have to try some wine from a vintage which is very good for me ! Today I came to see this famous film. This is a short film about the relationship of wine producers and their wines. This is a movie about two people working on a bottle of wine. In the film, we are shown a bottle of wine and two glasses. We have to say that we were the producer of the bottle of wine. The glass was in the bottle.|0
Eaten Alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's Cannibal Ferox. The characters are universally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there's no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a PG-13. Even the scenes of animal 'cruelty' are more tedious than usual. The only mildly shocking scene involves crazy Jonas, going a bit Goldfinger, wielding a blood soaked dildo; a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic.|1
This film is replete with sentimentality , unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe , and irrelevant material. It does what the film is supposed to say and it doesn’t. When you ask the question of why you have the film, the answer will have to be: to do what the movie needs to do to make it to the film. No one could have predicted that a pilot like me would want a movie like this if the film was released. The fact is, the movie is a film, not a documentary.|0
If the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:1. Awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say DADDY in the most annoying voice imaginable.3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn't mesh with the film. At all.4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. Oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.5. Hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.6.|1
This movie is not so good as I thought it would be . There is no story whatsoever , no character in any of it’s own story. As a writer, I like to be honest, because I do feel like I am always in a very good mood. The movie has a lot of plot, as it is a film that I really enjoy. This is why I am not happy with it so far. The story and characters are just so good! I can not really say how the characters are developed in this movie, but the film is definitely a good story.|0
Thank God I have fast-forward. I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. Whatever: It's a stupid cliché. It doesn't make any difference. There's this guy, javier Bardem, who constructs buildings or something. It doesn't matter. He is handsome, this Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there is a car wreck but I watched this in fast-forward, so ...who cares? Car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me.|1
"Whoa. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa.I saw this movie, waaay back when I was eight, in 1996. Back then, CGI films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. Also, back then we listened to things called CD players. But I digress. I used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, I've held reaally fond memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" is clearly a robot."|1
`` Tragic Hero '' is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic Godfather films , focusing specifically on the hero and the family of the hero, who will fight back against the forces of evil and war. In a way, this film proves that Godfather is a movie with a strong sense of adventure, and that the love of God is a real love story. I feel like if you were to read the first 2 movies in the series, it would be hard not to fall into the cult that the first movie was based on.|0
* * SPOILERS * * I rented `` Tesis '' ( or `` Thesis '' in English ) on the night shift on this day. I did not like it, but for a period of seven to nine months I rented it. I rented it at the moment I made it to a hotel, in a hotel room at the back of a taxi. At that time it was the first time I rented a rental car, but I do not know if I should charge more than that. But after the trip I felt that I could get away with it for a month.|0
Oh boy. Where do I begin on this piece of slime? This is one of the few real high-budget films on my list that I've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating, and that's not for the production values, which are pretty high. This movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible, and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low as a society we have become...For the first thing, Noah was absolutely not friends with Lot.|1
"Zachary Scott does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in ""Danger Signal,"" a 1945 B movie also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman, and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment."|1
I enjoyed the prequels , and found the relationship between Tucker and Chan previously hilarious . RH3 , however , wasn't quite as memorable at the same time as the introduction of the second half of the song . The first half is also very strong, but there is still some tension in it . RH3 didn't go so well for the first half as there was in the fourth and final part . However, it has a few nice chords and one more chord variation to the song and the chord progression is great. So far , RH3 is still very effective .|0
To tell you the truth , I do not speak Tamil , and I did not understand the film . The movie does not help me , I am a Tamil , and i am a Tamil . But as per the movie , Tamil , the film does not help me as well . But I will give you a good answer . I have not heard from him , but he will take it , so please tell me this . I have been in love with his film , but he has taken it off . You must not forget about him .|0
Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I 've ever seen . It 's a masterpiece where everything is at the top of the stage and everything is at the bottom. All of it is pure and uninspired. I was looking at the cover art and I couldn't find it so I downloaded it for the first time since I never played it before. I'm so happy to finally get it and to be able to enjoy it and be inspired by it. I haven't tried the movie in 2 years and if I could it would be worth it.|0
This film holds 7.0 rating on IMDb , so even I sensed something rotten in it 's synopsis I decided to watch it after looking on it. It is quite interesting as well. It has been shown over the years and I can only hope that you'll like it in the future. This is a must-watch when you're planning to watch it, especially if you are a big fan of the action genre and have a passion for seeing things unfold. It was originally released in 2002 but is currently being looked at more as of now with the same release date.|0
I don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. The acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. Miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat.|1
This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed.Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage.Strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration.|1
Normally , I do not review online , but it 's Saturday and I 'm trapped in my room , I don't know what the difference between this time and Saturday, and what the difference is between it and how it is supposed to be , so I only give up on this , if you have the time , and I have time , you may want to take this as a good example to help you learn something more about it . . . If I have the time I will read more articles from other people to help you understand what I do , .|0
First of all , I have watched this show since I was a little toddler , and I have always had the urge to watch it , but never had the opportunity to. I have not watched a single one of its episodes . I only watched one episode of it , in the first week of March , I have watched every one of its episodes . . I have watched it all the time since its first week , but none of my friends or family have ever watched any of its episodes , or even any of the episodes.|0
The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant , Russ Duritz , who has lots of interesting things to tell about his son. I like what he says so far. For now he goes back to the beginning of school. He has a baby boy of his own, and then he has three children. His son was born about 6 months. He has two kids, one is his first child. I like that he says a lot of things about what he was doing. For him to say that his son went to school is really nice.|0
This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in spades. I never felt once in this movie that Spilsbury was anxious for anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in this guy's portrayal.There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. Plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality.|1
As far as I am concerned, this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog.Both make this movie a bit unique, at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually, an American, Jules Dussain, shot the film, so it's not entirely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored.|1
Oh Gawd . I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front porch! I'll see you soon in the morning! Hi! Sorry about the noise but it sounds like I’m going to make an appointment to see if you want anything to do with this post. It’s going to have a lot to do with that. If you want to know what I think about it, check out my blog and Facebook page and check out my other posts. First up, I’m going to give a quick recap of my thoughts on the subject.|0
I'm racking my brain, but I can't seem to think of another movie quite like The Valley of the Gwangi. A Western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You gotta wonder why John Ford and/or John Wayne never tried it! The plot  While searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus), and the rest of the cast/characters enter a strange, lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse, but some other, more fearsome creatures as well.|1
I have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and I must say that i never felt that bad, which I felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very Bad. There were songs & songs. Nobody should watch this movie. The director has shown Germans speaking English which is so rubbish. Germans does not speak English. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for autograph. (Obv that he must have gave some money to her) In the promo they have shown prepare for Laughing riot.|1
I would just like to point out ( in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD with a limited limited time release) that it’s not clear how many people are willing to pay up for it. Many people think that they just pay it on DVD, but the truth is much more complicated and confusing than that. I think we need to figure out a formula for how many people have already paid for it. The problem is that most of the people who have been able to afford the DVD are not going to be able to afford it in the near future.|0
my friends and i watched this movie last night . it was pretty incredible . by all means , this movie was very well done . i love movies like this , but i wanted to make something great . this movie can't be better , the characters and the music could have changed but i still enjoyed the visuals . the music would have changed too , but i still liked the sound of this movie . i have seen many of them before and i just cant believe how much more i love all of them . i hope i can make a good impression to someone , i know i really love this movie .|0
"When naïve young Eddie Hatch , a window dresser at Savory 's Department Store , falls for a statue of Robert Louis Stevenson , a painter who was born in Paris and studied there , says he is a fan and that he hopes to go to England, where he's going to work. But as it turns out, this isn't exactly what he thought he wanted to do, and instead he's found out it's not how he plans on going. ""He's the guy,"" he says with a smile."|0
How did this film get into the Berlin Film Festival? I understand it got into the Panorama section, but still. This film featured:1. No plot. 2. Horrible acting. 3. Atrocious videography. 4. Some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video.The one clincher that accounts for most of its festival acceptances is the presence of that old standby: homosexuality. That's right, about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one graff artist makes out with another one and jerks him off.|1
The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts . You must watch it for its strong characterisation, and the visual style in the movie is so good that you would never be satisfied with any film. But I don’t watch this movie because I’m so tired of it, and I think it’s a good example of how movies work. But what I don’t get is that this is one of those films which do not really exist anymore. It’s just a movie and I just don’t get how it is.|0
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature. Finally!!!!! It's about time Hollywood got their act together. The big Studios always frown at edgy material, with Oscar written all over it. Go figure! !JERICHO MILE was made ahead of it's time. It's a masterpiece.Michael Mann, a true visionary, found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. Peter Strauss' Emmy award performance is probably the best character role I've seen in my film-viewing lifetime.|1
This movie is a mystery. It's not scary, it's spooky. You'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora's box and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I won't go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius.|1
this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great . Nothing is good Bloodline ... or not . You'll be glad if I see your movie and let's do a bit of research . This is a movie so bad . But this is the movie I am hoping to see . ... and it looks awesome . That's pretty impressive . ... that's great . ... so what are my recommendations? This movie looks like a great idea to me. In fact, I love that movie because it makes me feel so good about the movie.|0
Okay , it 's a movie for children , and it 's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy . I have to laugh , and it seems that adults will like it because it is a movie that we'll all enjoy . It 's only because it has so many things that they will enjoy . And I think adults are the most sensitive people to that , and so it 's a movie that people will enjoy , that people will like . I think that adults will like it , and it 's not just because it 's a movie , that adults will enjoy .|0
As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film , I am surprised at how many people seem to have posted this in the past few weeks or even a week. I think this film is the most interesting movie ever to ever be released on film, and I think I have been watching it for years and years and it's very entertaining, but not so much that it's good enough for the audience. I'm very curious how this has grown since I first read the IMDB.|0
Never I have seen a movie so terrible that i've gone insane. It was a HUGE waste of time seeing this crappy film. There are a lot of things i hate about this movie: The songs is so terrible (yet a little bit catchy) i hit my head on the wall(especially from the song 'Grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of Santa' which i hit 10 Times *shrugs*), the character design, and that evil, greedy, and Bitchy cousin Mel.I cannot stand her for one second, she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person i've seen.|1
When King Kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake , I was breathless . I do n't want to listen to any music , but I wanted to hear the new album! So I thought to myself : “Let’s go to a pub, we’re going to have a big party for you.” I told myself that would be fine if I could have my own place, but that wouldn’t be fair. I had to try something new! I wanted to go out of my way to show my friends that I was not alone.|0
It pays to watch Reader 's Digest . Or Time , if it was the original source of the article. To find out more about Reader Digest, read the article here . For those who are curious, you should know that it is a site dedicated to ‘The Reader ,’ not ‘The Guardian’ . In this article, I will explore how Reader Digest works .

This movie is not so good as I thought it would be. There is no story whatsoever, no characters and some dialog would have been nice. The gore effects are good and it gets quite bloody at times but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when that is over the scene with the girl starts. The music is a classic score and fits the movie very well. They should have made a 90 minutes version in which they could have had some time for character development so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table.|1
Someone says this anime could be offensive for girls ... not really . Embarrassing situations are funny ; first time I ever saw one. I think I've seen it before. . . . I think that this is something that I’m hoping to put up with some time for, but it’s not. And yes, this is how I’ve wanted to see it before. I mean, I have to admit that this anime has had its fair share of jokes, but the jokes are still fun!|0
"And one of 'em are bad movies. The title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not fish. This is not the Dante-directed ""Piranha"" of '78 (which did have the fish) and is also known as ""Piranha, Piranha."" A trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, hook up with a local hunter/trapper named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film resume of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise, they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece."|1
This is supposedly a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth. Yet, you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc, which are items used in the late 20th Century and early 21st. So when is this guy supposed to be telling this story - in 2020. Gee, I wonder how advanced we are then. How about telling us that.Also, there are several legal issues which also make no sense. In the courtroom scene, the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country.|1
Ben Affleck, about to be married, is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing herself to act insane). Who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? It is so badly edited, when I looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clichés, contrivances, and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye-makeup, the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters.|1
Film about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. Overwhelming impossibility of dealing with life and the means the children go to to try to achieve living. Only living. Staying alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to watch it because we are seeing truth and are afraid to see it. To see a world of despair when we are all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we have not got when it is so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the movie, are desensitized.|1
Wow. The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre. But still, even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense.Water has become incredibly rare substance?Well, that's strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe. And pretty easy to make. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voilà, water.Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after.|1
Very enjoyable 50 's Western . I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.Mostly Victor Mature. I really enjoyed this book as a result. Very easy to learn. A very easy to learn book. Very helpful for first-time writers, I have read a couple but not really. Great to know of other people who have also read them. A very enjoyable 50's western book. I'm also very happy with the story, and have read several reviews as well. Definitely recommend for anyone who likes Western literature. Good luck with all of your other Western books.|0
Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood . The plot has many twists and turns . The characters are often difficult to describe to the general reader . The reader will have to remember some of these twists and turn , or a few of the twists of the novel , if you want a great read. One thing that I’ve learned is that it takes a long time for the reader to realize this is the plot itself, but there are twists and turns within it. This is a pretty great book .|0
I looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. There is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. Zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. I was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!There's only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound!! The soundtrack is awesome! .............Don't expect anything from this movie.|1
I logged on here right after watching this movie, feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining. But all you miscreants appear to kind of like it. And so, since I want the job done right...From the opening shot, the movie establishes its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely unremarkable picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long, long time. Then it goes to some slow-motion skateboarding, which is at least a little bit cool, but then offsets that glimmer of excitement by overlaying the most repellent soundtrack song I've ever heard.|1
"While not truly terrible , this movie is still largely a waste of time , and paints an incredibly inaccurate picture

I didn’t see that in the review I wrote in the end of this review, but I do have to say I do have to admit I had no intention of doing a better job of writing this article. In the end, this review will not be the last. This film is a shame that it wasn’t written because it was bad, and bad enough that when it comes to movies, I will not hesitate to do it again."|0
New guy at an armored car company gets talked into becoming involved in an armored car heist by his fellow employees. And if you don’t believe me, ask yourself the following: ‘Why would anyone think this?’ And if it is the case, then who is responsible for the assault, and why would we care about the assault at all? How could we be responsible if the attack was carried out at a time when it was necessary for someone to protect the nation? And what’s wrong with this, as I believe the answer is, by no means everyone is responsible.|0
There are rumours that a fourth Underworld is going to happen. If so, than the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that succeed the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies, so that it makes sense ...In this case, I guess it doesn't matter that much. The third Underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two. They had their obvious flaws too, but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in.|1
Norris plays a Chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil 's apprentice ? who wants to , well , create a better life than he's given him. He takes him into the underworld to find a friend or family member , or whatever he needs to. Then, in the midst of his work, he learns the true meaning of murder : murder as it's actually done, or worse, murder as he's known it to become. If you think you can live your life in this way, you're probably wrong. You're not a killer.|0
One of low budget horror schlockmeister actor, John Carradine's more animated roles as a implied Nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the Reich. Mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in McDonalds.Hitler isn't mentioned by name, since America wasn't at war at the time they was filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!There seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black & white films of the 1930's and '40's.|1
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then, it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack--illegally, I suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com--3 discs-- for between $19-21, to be viewed on DVD in the US format, no hacking. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars.|1
"well , i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now out of print. So when i saw it, the first thing i looked up when I saw it was ""VHS"" in the title. I can only find the title for the first time and that was a good one, too. I hope it helps you with that. You should be reading this again. I've made my own version of the book, but the first time i heard about it, the title wasn't there."|0
"I love Japanese movies -- having seen at least 100-200 . So it 's obvious I am not afraid of Japanese films. Anyway, I am going to try and convince some of my fellow fans to join me in making one. For the sake of the fans, I just have to have some fun with it, and that's my main aim. So, here are the results of the two rounds. What I saw:

What they got:

3:20

I was very impressed. I am pretty sure I have been making it up since the start."|0
I can't explain it, but I find this movie not only funny, but so enjoyable I feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least I did when I had cable TV. I always felt it was a really poorly made movie, but perhaps that is because I watched it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take an honest look at at, but more importantly to just have a good time watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of the movie and I especially liked the cast.|1
To paraphrase Thora Birch : `` I kind of like this movie . It 's the exact opposite of everything that goes on around us, though . .. It doesn 't even look at anything we've already seen. It's like an old TV show. But you do have to stop watching the show. It's actually very well written. Like the film, we don 't really think about it at all . . . But we have to let it go for a little bit. I don 't even really know what to think . . .|0
I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel , but we also knew that there would be very little space left for the characters to get to Israel . . . I am glad that we had the opportunity to work with a different set of actors and directors, but we are still learning about the real lives of the people of the Middle East, so I would feel better to work on this project as well . . . . But I would like to find a place where we would have the opportunity to work in a different way .|0
I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel books. Counting this one, I have seen 3 pimpernel movies. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews i preferred greatly to this. It goes out of its way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. I don't expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script.|1
After five years in prison, Tony le Stéphanois (Jean Servais) meets his dearest friends Jo (Carl Möhner) and the Italian Mario Ferrati (Robert Manuel) and they invite Tony to steal a couple of jewels from the show-window of the famous jewelry Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he declines. Tony finds his former girlfriend Mado (Marie Sabouret), who became the lover of the gangster owner of the night-club L' Âge d' Or Louis Grutter (Pierre Grasset), and he humiliates her, beating on her back and taking her jewels.|1
i watched it because my friend said we could try it , when my father asked if we 'd watch the game it said you can, but I asked my mother why she wanted to wait while we watched the game so we couldn't, she said I don't think so but she wanted me to watch it , she told me to wait for a couple of minutes until it was done , we did that for the first time in ages , my father said I don't know what he was saying but it is good for my mother that she wants us to watch the game.|0
TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Rob Zombie borefest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 CORPSES. Regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction. *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there's anything to spoil)TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids.|1
Mr. Bean has always been my favorite . No matte how many times you watch the same thing , the next time you see a picture of one of my favorite things, I'll probably do my best to make up for it. This time is no exception, I will try it again. I can see why you are so obsessed with the matte effect, I do not think I have ever had it done with the matte effect. My favorite matte effect to look at, but this time I am so happy that it is done.|0
This is a pretty obscure, dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing, I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes, because it actually looked like night, unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule.|1
NBC should be ashamed. I wouldn't allow my children to see this. I definitely would tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof as to why NBC has always been a 3rd rate network The producers, actors, and writers should get on their knees and beg God's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark. The ark had NO deck. Lot wasn't even born when this event took place. Did anyone attached to this project try reading the Bible?|1
i found the film a bit predictable and boring but i am 14.i was really annoyed with my little cousin who loved to watch the series as a kid, but i thought it was funny when she said she was expecting a baby for the first time when her parents died in a car accident.he loved watching the series and i loved seeing it because i had always wanted to watch it more than just watching it. i think it was a great way to try and get myself to watch more series than i could, which i did.|0
You know I only watched 15 minutes of this film, so I can't really describe how great it is. I mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go. Then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director. YOU JUST CAN'T miss. I mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. This film comes on. You watch it and are shocked. It is so brilliant, so original it is so GREAT.|1
"As others that have commented around the web ... I 'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard . Having spent a few months flying with them, I knew what they were going to look like. They flew like it was going to work, but it was something I didn't want to see or know about. This is not new news for the Coast Guard. ""I had a great time in the Coast Guard. I did not have to fly as fast. I would have done it just like any other pilot in my life."|0
This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ' and 'Garden State ' not because of content and direction. It's an interesting film, and I'd really like it to include a little of the dialogue, but it seems this movie could be the next great example of why you should pay a premium when you can enjoy it while it's not too much. I would also like to add the ending of 'Crazy' to this film as it would be a much better example of why you don't spend much on the movie.|0
"1 . The Largest Amount of Money Spent was on the package of hot dogs they put on that guy. 14
The Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the defendant had ""a present and substantial likelihood of making a present or substantial likely threat to the safety of the public in the surrounding community."" 790 F.2d at 705, 706-7 (holding that there was insufficient evidence on the defendant's present and substantial likelihood that he would actually ""make a present or substantial likely threat"" to the community)."|0
OK the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all OK. But when the movie start...well its not my first videoville movie, i watched Ghost Lake, and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here. The story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student, with specials effect that me laugh, the blood look like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop.|1
"""Graduation Day"" is a result of the success of ""Friday the 13th."" Both of those films are about creative, bloody murders, rather than suspense. If you enjoy that type of film, I'd recommend ""Graduation Day."" If not, I wouldn't. There's nothing new here, just the same old killings.Even though I've given the film a 4 out of 10, I will say that it's not a repulsive film. It is watchable if your curious about it, just not creative."|1
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week . Never heard of it , but if anyone wants to see it here it is. Here's an image that would make you believe it was made by some of the leading British studios. You can also view them here, but they may not be doing it at the moment. It's almost too early to say what the film is doing here, so just let me know your thoughts or thoughts on the art, and if you have any questions for me on that, just let us know in the comments below!|0
This is most likely the best picture not many will see . It presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized manner, which is a bit more difficult to read than I anticipated, and if I were not a fan of the film, I would not be a believer. This is not the same film as the one I saw at my own school in the 80's, if you have been there and you have not seen that film. It is still in the same mindset as movies like The Good Wife (the movie that made it into the 80's) and The Fugitive (which still does well).|0
A great film. Every moment masterfully conducted by Toyoda and his crew. The actors give credible performances all around.The visuals are haunting,beautiful and sometimes hauntingly beautiful shots of the Japanese country and city landscapes.The sounds,courtesy of Japanese band 'Dig', are never overly edgy as one would expect from band-made soundtracks. It's strangely atmospheric and well suited to the scenes they're on. All in all, they worked everything out perfectly....Well, if they were to give any justice to the story, perfection is the only thing anyone could have accepted.|1
"This movie makes ""Glitter"" look like ""Schindler's List."" Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green-lighting a P.O.S. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. Larry Bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. Writer/director/producer/actor Bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. A vanity project gone south, ""Hell Ride"" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn't centered on Bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in."|1
I've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film. I'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that Noah's Ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Don't the executives at NBC have any class? I feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini-series. The script is so dumb, so pointless, and yes, TOTALLY INACCURATE! I can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes, but this film changed just about everything in the story.|1
"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The Dream Hunters"") in the past, I figured Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. The beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costuming, and Helena's artwork. The subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. The dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI horrifying."|1
Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad . This movie is a prime example of present day violence in modern day cinema . There are many bad actors and the acting is as bad as it can get. It is always nice and entertaining. It is often the worst quality of cinema in recent years. However, the movie’s production and the quality of the cinematography are excellent. There is a strong focus on the cinematography. It is also the best cinema of the recent years. If you want to see this film better than I can, you can go for it.|0
This is a cult classic for sure ! ! It is tricky to follow at times , but then again there are many people who are very into cult and they will tell you that cult is a word for anything. But I was going to write about it for this post. But I really want to make an analogy for you if you do not want to use it as an analogy ! ! It has many things to it, so if you do not like it, then it is better to just leave it out.|0
I love this movie . It is the first film Master P have ever done . It is based on this book. The first film that I watched it, I loved it . This is a movie that I want to do again . I have read a lot of things about the movie. I like it a lot . . . I have read all my reviews . . . but I would like to say something to you as much as I could. Maybe you could add me to those reviews . I will do that. I read all of my reviews again .|0
"...out of this movie.Sorry to say, this showed at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Our copy did not have subtitles, so I asked the Festival crew if there was a problem with the print received. ""Not so..."" I was told. ""the director wants it this way"". Again, sorry to say, my French is barely high school elective level (more than 3 decades ago). Much of the initial dialog is in French, so I'm sure I missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words."|1
This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot . I know , I am not going to do this anymore because I won't do it anymore, but I do have hope that this is not too late. This is going to get some attention . It’s not so bad but that doesn’t mean anything anymore. This is what makes the Scarecrow so interesting! The title is a bit old now but you know how to get it in to this one. You may be familiar with the story and you may already know what it does.|0
This was a modern TV classic ! The story goes like this , Bob has a girlfriend named Alicia . They have an adventure . He goes on and on and on with his adventures . The guy goes on and on and on . he gets his girlfriend back to her , but he has a girlfriend that he doesn't want to know and that she wants but doesn't know what he is doing . This is a good TV classic ! You can watch the original on tv. This is the same one that you see at the time on this page !|0
Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal film I 've ever seen . Very little of Segal , himself, was original to him in any significant sense, although there is a strong claim that Segal was a master of style over substance. (This is because he was an original artist of some sort, which I have not seen in any other film.) It is a rare instance where you are asked to produce a documentary, film, documentary, or otherwise in one of the major media formats, yet you fail the test of proof, or fail to make a persuasive case.|0
Cool action - yeah the premise has been done - but not this way - that 's the trick . . . and I've got a feeling that the game is going to get quite interesting, and it's not the game I wanted. I don't really think we're getting the right balance between the two things. First of all, they're both going to need a third, so in terms of getting the best balance of both. Second, and most importantly, the second part. This isn't about the second part.|0
"""Hoppity Goes to Town"" was the second and last full length animated feature made by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe to Disney. While Disney's films are well remembered today, both of the Fleischer films ""Gulliver's Travels"" and this one are forgotten. ""Hoppity"" is a spellbinding original, not an adaptation like the first picture. That is a major plus, one would think. No, the critics, rarely on the Fleischers' sides to begin with, tore into them for this."|1
This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen . It looked so amateurish . Chris Hegedus was in it and it is not even close to the best for documentary filmmaking , that was all he made . All he has to do is give me some kind of example to try to figure out what he is up to. Maybe I'll do that . I got some ideas from him that I have a hard time believing in . It took a while to get into it but when I looked it over I found a nice little clip of him.|0
"I don't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in, but I'm glad I'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish-ness of this thing. Okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the ""Die Hard"" series, but seeing little Jodie knock off a whole street gang, with a Glock, as a NOVICE yet...c'mon. All she needed was a bald head and a ripped T-shirt and she would BE Bruce Willis. Apparently, Jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be."|1
The only reason I didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable. Hannibal is BORING>BORING> BORING and BORING!!! This film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. It's actually quite tame in that regard. The story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. I have the feeling that director Ridley Scott just phoned this one in. The actors are all fine they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. It's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film.|1
If you were enjoyed by watching `` Guinea Pig '' - then you 'll like this movie to ! ``. It is a film about the life and work of a French painter. The main character is a young Frenchman named Guitre, who is an upstanding character. He has a bad back, weak shoulders, and bad teeth. He lives in Paris with a beautiful young family and their two young sons, and it was not easy to work with him at first. He 's a good man and a good citizen.|0
I watched this movie last night, i'm a huge fan of the book, and i was pretty happy with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon starred. But this one, it's just awful. Oh my God, i don't understand how they dared to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different, starting with the switching of Beth being the younger sister, and making Amy the 3rd one. And Jo interpretation, terrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and kinda angry young lady, and the actress portraying Jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl.|1
Forget the lousy acting , that can be forgiven in this sort of film . Or even the terrible , that's why it is the case that it is a shame to be called an actor . You see, I was watching it, and it was very, very funny. That is what I thought, because when I was being honest , I started to think of what I was missing, because it was very, very good , but that is what I am saying , that is that I would like to see more movies like that that I like, and that is where I am looking at it.|0
This movie could have had a lot of potential . Certainly with today 's technology , one would expect real movies to be watched online and watched live . But today 's technology can be viewed and watched online . But what would it really do for a real film, such as this one ? There are many things that have been revealed about this technology . But one thing that will change the way we view things on our TV is the technology . What are the things we see that 's are interesting ? It's an interesting technology to look at a scene on the TV .|0
I think I can safely say ( without really giving anything away ) , that this movie had no robots and there were so many of us to meet in the theater ( we could go out for drinks) but there were quite a few. The first few scenes ( they were in the theater ) are what I think you can expect to see in this scene . I’m not very familiar with the movies except one thing ( I actually can’t go into details ) . But there was no robots in this scene . That is a very interesting thing .|0
"I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now , but having just sat down, I'm a little disappointed in myself . I had a great deal of difficulty getting the book into the UK, but here is my story :

I purchased this book in March this year. It has a lot of good reviews. I'm so excited to try it out, but I'd much rather see it finished by next year than to get to grips with the book before it goes on sale."|0
This is no walk in the park . I saw this when it came out , and have n't had the time to put it back in place , I think I have it . But i hope to have something good with it , i would really appreciate your help , any help would be really appreciated . Any tips would be great too . I am thinking of a friend who came here for his birthday. He told me that she was going to do her own research but she could not come and visit because the police had to get her back.|0
Distributor : GOODTIMES home video Plot : A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense thriller. As she is in the process of building a world class team of superheroes, it seems the only way that she is truly happy is because she wants to stay with her parents. There are many reasons why this story may not be the most gripping. The plot itself is simple. It's pretty simple. There's nothing really new here. This isn't a story about what it's all about. Just look at the plot, the cast, the actors, the character.|0
I must admit I was n't expecting much on this movie . I was surprised I truly enjoyed it as a kid. As I have said, it's been fun watching all of it together. And I like being with you. Thanks for all the support I got. I was just in awe of your work. I was just wondering how you were going to get into movies like this in the next year? If you're a moviegoer you've got a lot to learn, I just don't understand it at the moment.|0
When I first saw the trailer for this film , I really wanted to see it . I thought some parts of the film were bad and I wanted it to have a good ending , I really wanted to finish it but I know there were a few parts that I just didn’t want to do, so the part that was good was about two hours. In the middle of the film, I realized that I had lost my focus on the ending . The end of the film, I noticed that there was only one character, the one with a bad ending.|0
A young couple decides to runaway to sunny California . They never reach their destination as they decide to pull up on a highway and set off on a four-hour adventure. The first half of the trip will be from San Jose to Long Beach and back down to the San Jose State line. What does the trail mean in California? It means you can't go straight up and back down to Long Beach like you need to. It can mean you can't go right up and back again like you need to.|0
I love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...I thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message. At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off. I was very disappointed. The martial arts is also suffering. I am hoping to see a more devoted Segal in his future films.|1
A few yrs ago, I remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that Rozzie R. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).I thought of this essay after watching 'Crimes of Passion'.Kathleen Turner exudes the same strength and style as Russell in her portrayal of prostitute China Blue. She's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by Anthony Perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading.|1
`` Mr. Bug Goes To Town '' was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced . The quality of their music in their own way. The most memorable moments of their production in the show are the one that happened on the live show, and the music was so great. When the show was announced, the staff of the studio asked that it be placed with the studio and that the crew go on it and that they go into a studio with all the equipment on the screen and they can see everything.|0
A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending H-bomb blast. Not only do they fear the radiation, but also mutants in the surrounding hillside. One of the group is already contaminated, but strangely poses no real threat to the others. Just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. Not one of director Roger Corman's best.|1
THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. It features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. This would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. The monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement.|1
"I grew up watching the ""Bowery Boys"" on the weekends and even at young an age I could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies. Still it was fun to watch Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs would beat the crap out him. The East Side Kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run, it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I am repossesin about my childhood."|1
I have to agree with the previous author 's comments about the excellent performances and plot . Started watching this show in February, and I had a pretty strong opinion of it a week later. I have been watching this show for more than 5 years now, but I have always been fascinated by it. I loved it. I enjoyed it but I don't really know if it will ever make me happy again. I do know that I love it, but that's the only way it goes on. Also, I think that as a director, you will never see enough of it.|0
"There's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon's ""Robe d'Ete"". It's surprising how much is packed into this short film. While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim, a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. On returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl."|1
When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie , you can never be sure if it will be a good one. In this video, I will take a look at the characters who were featured in the first half of the movie and how they wound up in a big way. It is definitely an entertaining one, so I will give a brief explanation in one of the chapters, but you can see all of the character's reactions as well as the plot of the movie. There are only a handful of characters that will have this effect on you.|0
The story of Sweeney Todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like Charles Dickens , and more contemporary authors like Stephen Fry and Stephen King. In the 1990’s, there was some controversy over who wrote it and how much it inspired, or even who were the actors. But for the most part, people said it was a wonderful novel and a great read. The other day, I was writing a review for a new book. It’s an anthology of classic horror stories that I’ve reviewed. The story I have to say about it is a great example.|0
"Who said it had to be believable ? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down for dinner. If you’re not already doing so, turn the tables and sit. There’s no such thing as “just enough evidence” but more evidence than “some real proof”. More evidence to back up a claim, and more evidence of what the actual case may be

“No real evidence” is not proof, it’s evidence that you’ve put out that you actually believe what you’re presented to believe to be true."|0
The best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but filmed from the top of a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it just gets worse from there.There's two black guys and two white guys as American POWs, as well as some Filipinos POWs and Japanese guards. The ranking POW of the Americans is a white naval Lieutenant, which is of course an O-3 in the navy.|1
"I am the sort of person who never , ever watches animated movies , but I make an exception for my favorite movies. If you want more information on this I would be grateful to you guys. __________________

I do not own a tv! I read books for kids, and have read a lot of articles and articles on TV. If you really wanted me, I would buy a tv! But it's not worth it. I would go to the movies and watch movies with friends or on TV."|0
I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. It is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on either Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. As for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that Jane Wyman was even nominated for an Academy Award. This must have been a period when she was well liked by her Academy peers.|1
What a wonderful film, filled with eccentric, unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story held together, getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order, this really shows what she can do with a filled out, complex role.|1
I was looking forward to The Guardian , but when I walked into the theater I was n't really in any hurry to get there. After watching the first season , I was worried I would see it first. But as I walked out to my seat, I was surprised to see a screen with some kind of music played, so I looked around to make sure my eyes weren't closed. I was surprised to see that it was a bit more than I'd hoped, but if I did, I didn't know why it was playing.|0
This movie , which I just discovered at the video store , has apparently sit around for a couple of hours when I think about it and it's about to get a bit stale. It doesn't sound like it has a long run on this list, but I think that's because it's not listed as a movie, it seems like someone has put it somewhere. In other news, I recently saw this movie and I was totally shocked that I hadn't seen it yet when it was in theaters and I was trying to decide if I wanted to make another movie on it or buy a copy.|0
Dear reader , Watch out ! This movie is not really a movie , though its creators have the impertinence in saying that is the only thing in the universe. In this movie its supposed to be the music that makes the movie, that is what it looks like. You can see it in the movie if you are looking for music, but it does not exist. What is the purpose of this movie? Is this movie was meant to be music or not? Are there some things that the music has in it?|0
Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after an overdose. Sinatra and his girlfriend have been together for a while and Sinatra has made some good movies and stars in a few films, so it's not too surprising that he's back and, well, pretty good. However, he had to have some bad drugs on the block too. So I'm going to keep talking about these movies so you can see what Sinatra does to get back in touch with his true feelings.|0
Piper , Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor in order to try and save him from The Fall (1910) in his garden, where they will take care of his beautiful and delicate pet. He goes in to visit the pet-nurse, with whom he has become very friendly and pleasant. He then gets into a discussion with Perturbations, who will take him down to the Manor for a couple of days before he dies. The pet-nurse wants to know how they can be so kind to each other (and he tells him they are both in good health).|0
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. It is no understatement to call it far fetched. How the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain. We have an expression here in the U.K. 'mutton done up as lamb' which suits her perfectly.|1
Whoa . I mean , whoa . I mean , whoa whoa.I saw this movie , waaay back when I was a kid , I was still a kid . I saw it on TV , back then because it was good , and I didn’t see much else but I think I saw some other movies. It was like a movie that I just loved that I liked the first few years of it but it had been a while since I’ve seen more movies. So I watched it some time later than I should.|0
Oh f*cking hell, where should I start... First of all; this show is just another stupid American non-funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor. The American way of laughing-track business makes the whole thing even worse. How come I can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? Pretty stupid, eh? This show is only for those American people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons for example).|1
A middle aged man , Robert Jordan , set in his ways , takes on a boy scout troop after the US military has announced its intention of arming a group of Marines on the West African coast by the end of the current year. A group of Marines, led by Colonel Robert Jordan, are planning to use their base on the Mediterranean coast in a surprise assault on a Russian-held port in Greece , as the United States announced that it had decided to begin arming these troops. Jordan was among the most senior officers in his squadron when he was in command.|0
At first sight , I must say already , watch The Contractor , 2007 . With Wesley Snipes too . It was a first for him . But before I get to The Contractor . And I must say . It was a very interesting show . He had an excellent personality . And the show was a lot more than I could ever have hoped . He is a very good actor . Now that we know about his character , and his abilities and abilities . But I cannot think about how it would have been . I must say .|0
Interesting cartoon , included on the DVD of `` The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra '' . I especially like the image of this guy's face, which was clearly seen on the side. I'm not saying this to be bad, I am saying to a lot of people what's wrong with us, we all deserve better from our leaders, if you have the time, then you're entitled to more than we all deserve. In fact, if you don't like it, we may as well not see it.|0
There 's a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by people who can hardly believe in anything as good as modernism and cosmology. Of course this is because there is no way of explaining it that way, so instead we need to look for a more realistic picture. For example, would it be possible to explain that there is no sense of connection between God's creation and the human psyche, because God created it? There is no distinction between creation and the human psyche as such, only the difference between God and mankind.|0
"This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and guts. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur sailor who competed in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world yacht race.I was very intrigued by the story after listening to a radio interview from the producer John Smithson, who is also the producer of ""Touching the Void"", one of the first documentaries that made a commercial success in 2003. I had gone to the cinema with great hope and not much previous knowledge on the historic event, and I'm relieved that it didn't let me down."|1
The Calu-what now? Yeah, I thought it was a stupid name as well. Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his writing staff. Starting off with the usual cheery X-Files teaser (a baby getting run over by a train) this episode... well I can't really say it goes downhill because to be honest it was never going uphill. Poorly written, with us feeling no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that baby at the start) the writer makes us hate characters before brutally killing them off, it's the worst technique ever.|1
"It´s all my fault. They all told me I should avoid seeing this movie because I´m a huge fan of the old TV-series. They were right. While production values are good and the actors themselves (including ""don´t look now"") Julie Christie aren´t that bad, the whole film displays a cheekiness and self-conciousness that clearly is without any justification. A comparison between the Karloff ""Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns 2000"" comes to my mind. In fact Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series."|1
OK , first of all , who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second , who would do all the work that is in the film and what we have, is not an artist like you , but a woman , who will be a master of this art , whose life will not be so bad . . . because in the meantime , she has become a good husband , and will do well for you and your wife and your sons, too . . . you , my dear , may God bless you for your wonderful work of art . . .|0
"This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. It is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. And that comment comes from the writer's cousin. This movie was so flipping bad, it made ""Hulk"" (The second worst movie ever) look like ""The Departed"" (One of the greatest movies in cinematic history). If you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie."|1
I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off. I loved it. I don't know why I liked the first one, it's so cool and I was so excited that the next one was the better one and I really liked it. There's a couple of things I've tried that I think would work if you did your homework and then you did it the best you can. I can't wait to read your post again. It's not perfect, but it is very important that we get it right here in this thread.|0
Insanely well crafted mini-series.I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS. Was heavily promoted at the time. I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series.The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast. Was 6-8 hours total. This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours. Cut some interesting, but slow scenes.I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete, not edited version to DVD.|1
During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it . Something like : ``I saw the trailer, and I don't recall having any idea who the director was, and it was not clear what he was filming.'' . . . I was pretty impressed by that statement. You see, I thought it was a great movie, but a lot of people said that was a bad movie. People said that I had to watch a movie that was supposed to have a main character. That was a bad film and I thought it was good.|0
Have seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist. The most sad things are:1. It's very slow. 2. How Ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of Asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? 3. Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. We see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home.|1
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young girl who has lost her life. But that secret is only an open secret and the story goes wrong after the truth of it comes out. On December 28, 2009 at approximately 10pm, I was at home with my husband, son, wife, niece (who was only five months old when he died) and granddaughter. The only way I can find out who or what he or she was, is through the Internet.|0
Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a Communist in order to obtain information about party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to contend with beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that Cvetic is a double agent.|1
I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost everything I would expect from a Bruce Campbell sci-fi movie. Its campy and very funny. Ted Raimi was also hilarious and extremely goofy. The plot is wacky, an American business man goes to Bulgaria and is killed. Stacy Keach plays a mad scientist who saves/brings Bruce Campbell back to life by implanting half of the brain of an ex-KGB turned cabbie. Bruce Campbell spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent.|1
"I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me, but I think I have an idea: one of the ""Fat Guys At the Movies."" The person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (I'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I misquoted.) At any rate, I made the decision to watch it. So I take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen."|1
While it 's not `` perfect '' , it 's close . Love Barbara Stanwyck , SZ Sakall , Sidney Sheppard , T.S. Eliot etc . For the love of the world , it is a great pleasure . To the end that 's one of my favorites of all . There will be no doubt in this life we are very much to be with you , to be with you in all the ways you have known our life to be . This is something I have wanted so much the very last month to be able to say on a daily basis .|0
"This is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen. Even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'The Bad News Bears' and 'The Mighty Ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, ""Don't bother with us, we're all losers,"" you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. All the usual suspects are here."|1
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background. For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change. The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill. To go along with that scenery, any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, neither of which Houston has very much of.|1
If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart , then you probably know about the $ 5 DVD bin that sits in your pantry. These DVD's are not cheap. The only problem is that you may want to use them on your favorite DVD set. You can also take the items out of your pantry. Many people like to do the shopping on their own and they often do it for themselves. This isn't that unusual. However, if they have a shopping experience with their favorite DVD set, you should try them out and see what works for you.|0
Wow ! This is the movie that should be shown on TV at Two in the morning on Cinemax for two years and all the people of the world will be watching the film for sure and we will make sure we do it right and you will be happy! There are two ways to see the movie. (1) We have the Cinemax DVD. If you do not have one, the DVD is good and we will take care of you. (2) If you have been there and you don’t have the DVD, wait till now and you can get the Blu-Ray to see the movie.|0
Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films , and they do n't have as much time as he wanted to give it to his team. I know a lot of people will say he was brilliant, but he was still very busy with other projects, even when he was on his own during the second half of 2016 and he was only going to work for a few minutes at a time during the second half of his next project . I was able to watch the movie again a few times after it, and that helped a lot.|0
When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché . With character names like “Garden” or “Wolverine” that you’re used to, it’s hard to know how to make a film with those names. I’m going to start by saying I love this movie but it’s not going to be that cheesy. Hell Ride was a fun little movie. There was a lot of action and the characters were charming and charming. And as with every movie, this one made me want more and more of the ride.|0
"I do n't understand why some of you ( or many ) have given this film upward of 8 stars . ~~~

So how can we say ""I know this is a movie, we know this"" when we're not the
movie's target audience? _""I don't like it. I don't like it, we don't. ""_

 _""I didn't say that. ""_

 _""Why did you say that instead?_

I 've never made one of these before , but this movie was literally so bad I had to say that, I don 't know what I saw 'til the end, even if I wanted to. That movie was a complete disaster. It 's a very, very boring movie. I wish it 's been like that one. But I also wish I could see some other movies like it and I 'm just glad I don 't. It just doesn 't make any sense. Maybe I should make it more generic. If it is what I 'm looking for it would be, I just don 't know.|0
I 've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra 's music , and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life , in which he described him , and his work in terms of how he was influenced by music in general. Frank Sinatra's music , which he is famous for, has been well received , as well as having been performed on a wide variety of mediums, in both radio and on stage. He is also known for his many other musical influences such as jazz, rock, and jazz-rock, among other influences, as well as other influences which have been mentioned as well as being mentioned above.|0
As others that have commented around the web... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. Having said that, and being the skeptic I am, I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors. There was some cheese, but all in all, not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the film yesterday, I've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. This isn't the case.The movie is truly more character/story driven than action.|1
The Toxic Avenger, hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength is back in this sequel that gets mostly everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, whom is in cahoots with an evil corporation who just want the avenger gone to get a stranglehold on Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this one, a much less grim, much more comical tone, and a plot line that can't hold a candle to the original.|1
"This movie is bad, so bad that my mother who can barely stand the ""suspense"" of Disney's Snow White, was chuckling through out the entire movie. My first warning should've been that it was in the $5.50 bin at Wal-mart. But I have actually found some good movies in that bin, so i can't fault if for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the DVD, it was actually $3.88. Again I have never been one to ignore the cheapies."|1
Being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary , I was eager to find out who you are as a woman , as I could never find someone who wanted to fuck me over and make fun of my penis for having sex. Here are some of the photos you will need to look at if you want to find out how many people there are to fuck. You can click the images above for a better idea if you aren't able to take photos. These pics were taken over several years ago at a lesbian couple who lived in Westchester, New York City.|0
Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is . Everyone has had their fair share of movies that are a little bit slow. I don’t see how this could be anything new, but it sure works. Not only does it show how a movie can be an effective way to convey the true meaning of a film like this. But it does do so on a level that if you look around and don’t know any more about the film then you know that it is an effective way to express it.|0
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV. I only wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I didn't' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My step-son is now 35 and thank the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother.|1
"This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency, turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca, to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the ""screwball"" pictures of the 1930s.Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had by now settled into something consistent, so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate."|1
This was shown on a premium channel , so I did n't realise it was made for TV . Even now I've been able to play games on it , but I haven't yet even played in my home. My friends have also been able to do this for TV , but it seems there are some things that are too big a deal. I'm sure I have to get used to TV , though , so maybe I am wrong . Anyways , I can't really think what I would have to buy to make a TV like this.|0

I'll give you this. I like it a lot, but you'll need to get over it before you can let me in on the plot. I'll tell you about this. I'll explain how it works in a few minutes. Okay. ."|0
"Sam O'Steen, the film editor on the superlative suspense flick ""Rosemary's Baby"" from 1968, here directs a quickie TV-made sequel, one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, in for Mia Farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about Satan's son on Earth. Most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her Oscar-winning role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland well-cast as her husband, Roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway."|1
It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film . Initially , I was struck by the lack of a strong female character. I wasn’t much interested in female protagonists because I was curious about them being men or women because of the gender differences. The way the story is written is different from other contemporary films because there is more to the story and the characters are not “real”. As a result, it has been more challenging and difficult to make this movie because of all the new characters. Now I’m going to try and give a brief summary of this movie.|0
What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this ? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece. Not only are you laughing about it but it is a very, very cool book. I highly recommend it. If you don’t already have it, then it is really hard to take it off. That’s really what I think. (I’ve been checking out this website before, but it seems to be doing the same thing with the book. I am a little surprised that I am still waiting for it to be done.|0
Spoiler with plot explanation: a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy (that pops out from nowhere, and no questions asked... ) that went wacko, and Casper the friendly ghost trying to avenge his death. With every frame movie gets more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Ending seams completely dumb, it has nothing to od with the movie itself, i think someone run out of ideas or just get to the point that movie is s**t this way or other, so it may as well have a stupid ending.|1
Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what the story was like. The story I was trying to tell is very different than what I have heard so far. It’s not a story that I’m afraid of telling in my own life, but it’s important to remember how much the story of Koyaanisqatsi in the past really was. The stories are really great. I love how they describe what people think of it, what they experience and how people relate to the story as a whole.|0
For many year I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture, I found it not very interesting, but at least it was more interesting for me. For the past 3 years of my life I have seen this movie. It's a real movie but this movie, which I didn't even realize was a movie, is a real movie, so I believe that the movie is a movie of ninjas. And it is not. There are also some other books by some other great movies. But this one was not even a movie.|0
Predictable, cliche, unbelievable, boring...what else can I say? It's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yeah, and the entertaining end zone antics.But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the Globetrotters/Washington Generals matchup.I was well into the second act before I figured out these were supposed to be PRO teams we were watching (all clad in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page.|1
The inspiration for the `` Naked Gun '' movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy and he was just starting out at the age of 21 - as an actor/director. For those of you who never had an acting career before then, it was a strange experience working in such a big studio, where we had the opportunity to do some great roles, and to do the same in a much bigger studio. It would have been quite difficult to work with people who didn't have an actor/director.|0
Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets better every time. But just because you have a little extra spice to your palate, you should definitely add more to the recipe. I think it's important to add something fresh that has more of something else added. If you want to drink this with your own body it's worth it. Also note that I made this recipe myself - I've done this myself, and it's pretty tasty as well. You've got a great flavor.|0
Watching the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and certainly it *is* a parody, but I'm not sure of what (a fairy tale? an opera? a Hollywoodian C-movie? - if there was something like that), and I can assure you it's not worth watching. It's simply a pointless film (cf. a good parody is everything but pointless), with pretentious, shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or better, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte.|1
the first toxie film was dark , gory , and hillarious . This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz , but is definitely a serious film to listen to – this is one of the first of the film’s most engaging performances. As mentioned above , we had the chance to listen to the film while the band was playing at the venue. The band was already playing at the venue last night, but it was still not as entertaining as last night’s show and the film’s atmosphere was quite different from last year’s show.|0
"Just saw this movie on opening night . I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see this. I’ll give it an example. I saw the movie in the cinema after the movie. Now I want to go back to the movie as well. I’ll wait for more info. Here’s my experience on opening night:

The first time I was in my apartment, I was sitting in the kitchen just eating breakfast, which I ate in the dining room. The TV was on the floor with a monitor and a cable box."|0
Love this little film, that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem, SHALL WE DANCE? (not the overblown Gere/Jlo remake...) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was showing on a STARZ Promo Weekend, because as far as I know, it's not available on DVD. I'll watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remember the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it, and she positively shines in this. She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT!!|1
I awarded this presentation 4 stars . They are all for the script , which has been butchered beyond recognition, and for the time being . I think they are going to take more than a couple hundred years of writing to get to where they are now , so I think they are going to continue in this manner . They may be doing a great job and it is hard to argue that they are going to continue making good writing . . . . and if I am correct, I am really, really disappointed . . .|0
We have a character named Evie . Evie just wants to be a good person . She 's nice , but she is not the type of person for me , I 'm a girl , I 'm a pretty girl , I 'm just not a good person .

But I 'm very nice , she doesn't give me much .|0
What can I say ? After having read Herbert 's books and loving Lynch 's movie version , I was inspired to create a website with the hope that the content would be accessible to everyone. As you probably already know, there are many different web design companies, each of which have their own set of design guidelines. There is a wide array of web designers in the industry, ranging from high school and college drop outs to those working in corporate or start up businesses (see below). I have only a small sample of each of them.|0
Televised in 1982 , from a Los Angeles production , this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage version of the original. This is also the only work filmed in the film that was not created after this time period, with a set set up that is as modern as possible. As of this writing the film is the second and third best produced in history, having been filmed for a time period from the late 1950s up to the 1970s, but not in production at this time point, and was not made after that.|0
Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. We're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is.His character design is unappealing. The top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.And penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago the parrot in Aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried.|1
Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my want list for quite a while, and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back. It's never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, which I'm quite satisfied with. The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn, with an emphasis on porn. A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed.|1
Most awful casting I've ever seen. Clark Kent as a crack head, a very feminine looking woman as a trans and on and on.............Stupid ass violence just for the sake of being violent. No content, no meaning. This person has never been on the streets. It's a joke!The only thing dumber than this movie is the fact that I finished watching it. I just kept thinking it couldn't get any worse but it did to the very end.Trying way to hard to be an off the hook movie. Trying to be freaky. So stupid!|1
This new movie by Jeskid is awesome ! Check it out and you 'll be amazed . The story of Jeskid and his journey with his family will help you understand the journey he has to take when he was in the military, as well as get a feel for what his parents did when he was a young lad. In the movie, Jeskid is a young boy who gets caught in a high-stakes struggle and is rescued and thrown in the sea by a captain who wants to be the first person to land him. You can find more information at Jeskys.org and follow the link to the movie.|0
"A few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure ( for a bit of inspiration) sources. This happens because of two reasons:
1) I feel that I am in a minority of friends in the community,
2) We are doing this all the time, but I think it's important to think about your own friends. We have some really interesting friends, and I've been able to get away with it. And I'm sure many of the community members will appreciate this bit more than I do because of it."|0
(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it - it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges; as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past, the present increasingly falls away, until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether or not their stories are true, and whether Stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine.|1
!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!! !The premise goes like this : A store gets burnt down and assistant Sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which Sergio agrees .So far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ? Come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( A very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ?|1
"I have to say this is the worst movie that I have ever watched in my life, I cannot believe that I wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. Who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. Well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. Also the part where those ""men"" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film."|1
I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from anemia. For a while Novo had only been known for being anemic. It didn't quite work as well, as you'd expect from the title. In its first episode, Memento didn't get the message that Novo didn't have the same impact on him as it did other writers but he did get it when he called up the guy who wrote this book and asked for help with a story he was working on a while back.|0
James Stewart plays Johnny Mason , lawyer . Carole Lombard is Jane Mason , wife . Lucile Watson the mother-in-law of Johnny. Johnny Mason was a good boy and a great parent. She was a great wife and a good mother. She had a great heart. And she had a great way of saying that, she loved her daughter and loved them. Lucile is a beautiful girl. She didn't have to have a mother. She had two sisters. Lucile and Jane made their parents proud. It is a wonder they did not lose a little bit of their own beauty in them.|0
Despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as I am a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I just can't recommend this film.The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort.|1
Get the CD instead. The show is tame, and the editing sucks. The crowd gets way too much screen time, as does Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way (which leads me to believe it's the exact same shot) than they do during Richard Kruspe's solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed, and the replays are simply redundant. Not worth the tape it's recorded on.|1
Yes , I spelled that right . This movie is so predictable , the actual word needs additional letters to be spelled out. : ) You should be aware that I am not trying to tell the story in the first place, but to make it clear. So, in this movie you should just write down the words with the first letter, without the third letter. So what do I need to do in order to make this work? Well, I am going to write down an outline of the entire movie. I will write out the numbers on the left because it's so unpredictable .|0
"I'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. I find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive. This movie focused more on a ""let's just make it gory"" view.The movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just spraying out of the hole. I wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively."|1
There 's only one thing I 'm going to say about cat in the hat ... as a KIDS movie, then ... but I don't know what it might be ... I 'm just going to give it a go. There are a lot of people I 've heard talk about cat in the hat, and they don 't have all of the necessary information to make it good. They 've got a problem, a cat. But what it 's good for me ... I'm not interested in a cat. I don 't see anything wrong with that.|0
Imagine if you will: four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal. If you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times. Otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough, but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens.|1
"Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut . Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called the Munch, or as she describes it, ""Munch is the most beautiful creature you can have on the face of a living person, the most beautiful creature that you could ever have imagined."" The Munch (played by Amy Adams), a play that's been in the works for years, is a classic American play in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The play is about a young girl who has come to the city with the goal of making a fortune by raising a large family."|0
"As much as 'The Beginning' showed that we're still going to get ""classic"" x-files, Drive showed that the X-Files was going to explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique teaser to Drive, with the news camera footage. It was an interesting transition from the the TV to the real events. I would've liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car. Upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 I was thinking, ""Am I on the right channel?"""|1
OK , a film about a film that takes a crack at Video movie making could be entertaining . Could someone show this film to someone and give their opinion? . This isn't about the film itself. I think the audience would have been interested in the film's premise and its content. But the audience is interested as a filmmaker and the content is more than the film. This film doesn't say anything in relation to the movie. However, it is a film about a film being made. For a film, a director will have to be a director or at least the director of that movie.|0
I have just started watching this show . Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTÉ. For the first time in 20 years you can watch on the TV Channel RTÉ. I watched the show on the RTÉ on Wednesday afternoon and was very pleased with the result . We are very pleased with the result , its been an enjoyable time to be on this channel . Our main focus is to provide an alternative media for our viewers and to encourage our team to work with us in their fields.|0
"I'm originally from Brazil... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy. They told his life story and he never got one ""centavo"" (Brazilian cent) of that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in Brazil. Sad... but that is the world we live in. It's about making money not saving lives. Question is: Where is Fernando today? Most probably... dead. We tend to want to live in this ""Disney filled fantasy bubbled life""."|1
"This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties . It 's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched his first record label in France. When you first heard the Renoir, you thought it was a collection of some of the best music of the 20th century. Now you know it was a book about the world’s most influential singer and artist, Renoir. The Renoir: The New Music

For me, at the heart of the story of the Renoir is the relationship between music and life. It is about how we live our lives, why we move forward in time and why we do so much."|0
Just in case the title didn't give it away - this movie is garbage.Short review? Yeah.I decided to spend as much time writing this review as Hollywood probably decided to put into the script. I doubt it'll be published considering how poorly I worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it -- stick to cherishing the first Sandlot movie. It completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way. The sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.|1
Dolemite is awesome . Rudy Ray Moore 's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as good as you can get, and it also makes you feel like there's nothing worse, like they do when you're in a trance. Rugby is pretty fun. I think it could make an impact on the younger generation. Maybe it could make them have the chance to be a good player and get out of their old ways. I don't think it would be a terrible idea. It would help them learn to make the right moves in a way they weren't prepared for.|0
No redeeming features, this film is rubbish. Its jokes don't begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn't enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc.|1
"I just found out before writing this review that ""Komodo vs. Cobra"" and another movie called ""Curse of the Komodo"" were both directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. That might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. They both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. What differences are there?"|1
I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it's even better then The Deer Hunter, which was overrated. Both this movie and Year Of The Dragon are very underrated although i could see why someone would not like this movie. At three and a half hours the movie just goes on too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken are fighting over Isabelle Huppert but she can't make up her mind about which one to be with.|1
I 've been studying Brazilian cinema since 2004 , when I stumbled onto `` Cidade de Deus / City of Angels''. For the past year I have been studying it through a series of seminars and articles , and I can say with some certainty that I have been a master of this genre. I had never actually tried this before, but I have to say this was a true joy, as it gives so much joy to people who would never have considered it before. It is quite easy to learn, but as soon as I started reading it, I fell in love!|0
I supposed 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is a dull slasher flick. Yes, it have some good point, but it's a rehash from another flick. The acts is so awful nor the plot. The story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. When an initiation become a prank and cause the life a boy in jeopardy, the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy. Sound familiar, right? It's derived from Scream, Friday the13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, you name it! 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is so below average film.|1
"I am partly a fan of Miyazaki 's work . I say `` partly '' because most of his films are not. But they aren't '' really''' good. And what I am a fan of is ...

Miyazaki was a great Japanese director. He worked with Aikawa's films, although they didn't really work like this, either in the Japanese or English language; and in Japan, Aikawa had a small studio with a small production staff. To his credit, however, he did not do much of much in the Japanese theatre."|0
Well, to each his own, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie through to the end was that I held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. No luck.No disrespect for the supporting cast or for Zefferelli's staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well-portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc.|1

The movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the Stooges . The story is told in a very short and very interesting way, which makes it a little difficult to say a lot about the movie in its entirety. In fact, you could probably just as well say that the movie was not really meant to be. Why was the movie so bad that it ruined the whole story? I get it. But I also want to say, I don't think it was that good. But it was not a bad movie and it is not really a good movie.|0
"Roger Corman has enjoyed his shares of cinematic infamy in his illustrious low-budget career, spanning over 300 movies. While few (if any) would call him great, his films' obscure connections to underground culture (via reference, tribute, or influence) have ensured him a warped legacy of sorts. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his own films (""Piranha"", ""Humanoids from the Deep"", ""The Black Scorpion"", etc. ), without improving on them in the slightest."|1
It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no clue. I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came.|1
This is quite possibly the worst documentary I have ever seen. It looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the Directors of The War Room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided), but it looked beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement. The quality was so pitiful that I couldn't stand watching it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like Chris Hegedus.|1
After an astronaut dies in space , he is brought back to a military base . Inside the man are two robots . The second one is his friend. It has been two years now and they have been discussing the future of their spacecraft . The third one, their son-in-charge , is still living and his father will soon be leaving for the military. What they have been saying with all the details is they are not the only one to have spent the better part of a year on a research mission . They are the very last ones and they plan to spend the next year on a space mission as well .|0
If you are a Christian or a Jew hoping to see an accurate Biblical ( or Torah ) portrayal of the world of Jewishism, you might do a little research for yourself. Here is what you can do. It’s not all about how you are Christian or Jewish. This is about how you think. It’s about the Bible. It can be translated as “The Bible is not the Bible. The Bible is the Word”. What does that say about you? You will learn more about the Bible if you have an interest.|0
Realistic Master-Piece. thirty years later, the pictures can look a bit old, but actually, it only accurate the 'fist in the face' effect of the movie. I never saw in my whole life a film like this one. First time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction... And It didn't looked like... That movie is a masterpiece that every single person in the world have to see. It's the best ever society critical movie. The ultimate movie that demonstrate that the system is down.|1
( HR is what Himesh is called in the movie , I think he likes it too . ) It's a great movie by Himesh , but he doesn't like it when he gets it's own set of lines so he has to cut out the rest and start over with it. . . . And I'm glad that you don't even have to cut out the ending lines . . . And that's what he is . . . . He just has this feeling . . . that I just came from a place like this . . .|0
Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle . I could n't believe how bad this film was . I watched it merely to catch my own eyes, as if I were still a teenager with my hair in a bun . . but that's not what happened here . I couldn't believe it. I could feel my heart pounding so hard I had to cry. I was crying. And it wasn't like this was really what happened. It was the film we saw in the movie theaters at the time where it was actually on the film screen. It was a good movie, though.|0

"Acting 10, Script 1. ""Hurlyburly"" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people may get away with this on stage, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. We're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that, while brilliantly written, adds up to nothing. Even worse, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin use the word ""ain't."|1
"Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, ""Graduation Day""! All of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. That is, however, IF they can make it TO graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... Yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the Navy for Graduation."|1
Visually, this film is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles, that had my hopes up at the start, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much spectacle is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. Active around the start of the 20th century, Fish's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age.|1
STMD ! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I 've seen in quite some time . . . so I am sure you will enjoy what this film does , but as for the rest of the film , I don 't have any idea what it could be , since I don 't think the majority of people will find out . . . so what you may or may not know , may or may not be up on YouTube . . . I will keep you updated , so please feel free to reach out to me . . .|0
I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the first time it's been released. The film was a classic. There were two different types of movies. There were the action-heroes. There was the thrillers. There was, again, a romance movie. This time they had one type of romance movie. The first time I saw this it was on DVD! It was so cool I didn't think it would make it onto DVD until it arrived. But it did.|0
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday. There are good and bad in EVERY race, why make them all out to be bad? That goes for all races today. John Harper was an educated man, he graduated from high school, he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school, and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation.|1
Before we start , may I say I hope you 've already eaten when you 're reading this . Why am I writing this , anyway ? It seems you should know that I have come here to ask a few questions . But before I did , I asked you , what can you do ? You may well ask the questions you've asked us all .

Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic, but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie. They aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes? I guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 1/10's it will get. Is this better than any decent zombie movie? No.Acting, corny and rubbish.Sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from.Cinematography. These people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix.|1
Am an ardent Vijay fan . I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It is a remake of ’70’. The remake was directed by ‘K.Sakai’.The remake of Vipassana in Hindi is better than his previous version.The remake is a remake of Vipassana, which was not made for the Hindi remake and it had to be edited by Rajkumar. “What happened to the Indian films?” asked Rajkumar. “We did the remake. We had to edit it out. We didn’t even have the time or funds.|0
"Not too good a movie . Sure , it contains action , but the effects are n't all that good

I was really hoping to see something a little like this when I watched it so the review wasn't great. But if I remember correctly the movie isn't very well acted. This one wasn't very well acted, but I thought the story was good for the money. The acting is really interesting. But the dialogue is not that good. I would have been happy to see it again after watching it, but I don't think this was the right choice for me."|0
"The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like, 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for worst film of all time. A phony looking giant vulture attacks 'Lionel Trains' in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. It's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie, ""It Came From Hollywood,"" where this gem is hammered for the line, 'A Bird As Big As A Battleship', with gleeful, endless needling."|1
"First i got ta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code . sure , the movie is pretty nice , but i thought the scene was too pretentious. But i think the movie does a good job with its plot. For example , this movie is also not pretentious at all, when i see that it is like this:

The movie is a bit like this one :-

I think its the first film i watched. The movie is a bit like this one :- But i think it does a better job with its plot."|0
I went into this movie determined to like it . I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street , Glen Gary , or Fox , and these movies are a great way for me to explore the world of entertainment , but I wanted to learn more about the arts in general as well. To be a part of this conversation , I have to say that in the beginning of my acting career, I wasn’t sure whether I could do anything to be a part of it . I knew that I didn’t have anything to lose, so I thought I would find something to lose .|0
In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no name cast and I do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films. I mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget. So what does one expect? Hitchcock?I felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously.|1
The only reason I did n't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable . . . But I have to tell you a story. It's not the right story. . . In the early morning of October 3, 2001, I was about to be shot by a sniper. When I opened the bedroom door, there were three men with a rifle around the corner from the second and the third men. There were no armed men in the bed. I stood in the middle of them. The room was empty except for the three armed men.|0
"(May contain spoilers) I find myself disappointed with the criticism this movie receives. While it is most certainly not perfect, it is much better than it is given credit for. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title number, ""Where Do I Go? "", ""Easy to be Hard"", and ""Black Boys/White Boys"". While I have not seen the stage musical, I think that it clouds the judgement of many. This is not the musical you see in theatres. Do not attempt to compare them."|1
Most of the critiques on this flick have been pretty damn accurate . It is an hour and half waste of screen time . I have to agree to one thing, I liked this movie . But I think it will go a long way in making the movie seem even better . . . I really do appreciate it. It was amazing. I also liked that it turned out to be a decent story . That is really why I liked it . It is just a small bit too much for me . . I don’t like too much about it . .|0
... with a 500$ budget and a bottle of ketchup.If you are a fan of C movies with no talented actors whatsoever, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and lousy camera-work, this film delivers.All others be warned. You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder.The film is good for some laughs though. Watch it with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie.2/10 for unintentional comedy.Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler.|1
Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of worn out VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written on top. I think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties, was because of Sandra Bullock's name. Bullock's fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting. Rest of the movie It's fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it's bad but after that it's going worse. Much worse. Directing is awful.|1
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. But since it featured Sandra Bullock, who I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. The dialogues are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. The acting is amateurish. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice, dead people moved their legs. When my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, I immediately and joyfully complied. This is an amazingly bad movie.|1
This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that hurt, ring true and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler. But I wanted to change the outcome, even though it is right for the story, because I had already come to care about these people. I can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me. Beautifully shot, acted, edited. High caliber work all around, even to the use of just the right sound and/or music to advance the story.|1
"""De Dominee"" is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! But that doesn't really matter! Because it failed to grab my attention! This movie bored the crap out of me! It lacks substance and style! The substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action!"|1
i was a huge fan of this series. Yesterday i watched it again on DVD. I was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not? But in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good. Acting wise Rakesh Bedi(Raja} & Satish Shah is brilliant whereas Swaroop Sampat is plain bad but I think she gets the job done. Maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her. This series shows what good, clean comedy is.If this series were to air in the current year I would have given it 9/10.|1
"What a mess -- and I 'm not referring to the `` destruction '' in the title . I could also say that it's a ""mistake'' because it's not clear where it gets its name -- but if you look at the title it looks like this --

This is what it looks like:  

But there's a little bit of detail behind the title. There's an item here with the `` title '' is not a ""title""''

So that's it. There's the `` description`` item that is a part of the description thing."|0
Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It does raise interesting questions, but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. The typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included).|1

"My first post at the IMDb has to ( unfortunately ) be to warn others not to waste their time on something as simple, as easy as:

echo ""<br>
<a href=""<?php echo $db->escape_string($db->escape_array($a.a.categorie)) ?>"" ></a>

It 's astonishing that some people saw this as art . We saw it as a poorly filmed ( shaky) performance. In fact, the video is quite good. It seems to show the man ( himself ) walking through the street in front of the camera. It appears to show him in a state of shock. It's a really bad show . We are not sure why or how, and it is very hard to get a good look at the young man in front of us, but it would appear that the man was a man who was terrified of being seen in the camera.|0
"The Canterville Ghost ( 1996 ) .The director made this too sappy a production . Maybe it 's the generation after the '60s but for this it's not too sure . . . It looks like a comedy . . . There's no acting here . . . What does it have to do with ""The Barber of Benjamin"" ? But then the first scene was taken from a new book . . . I got a chance to go and find an old copy of ""The Last Barber of Benjamin"" and I couldn't . . . Oh . . ."|0
I ca n't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10 ? It really is great , very funny and I wish it would be removed . I will check out this video, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_iQmw4g5X4 . It really makes my world a little bit more relaxed, and actually it is very cool , a great movie and is very funny , really interesting and gives me a new perspective on everything I have heard about the internet . I will review the movie , watch it again and I think it will be very cool to watch. Hope to see you again soon .|0
"THE worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen allot. Acting is horrible, plot is awful, idea is terrible, and no research was done what's so ever! Ok, I admit, `Air Bud' was a pretty good movie, but not `Soccer Dog'. This ""dog"" is smaller than my cat! How can he possibly play soccer? Even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half! It's horrible, don't watch this movie."|1
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film. The writing, acting, directing could not have been better. This was a story that begged to be told, and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so. Stories like this one are not pleasant ones, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A film that can do that is a rare a special thing.|1
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. The opening narrative, music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites, a shame it isn't available on DVD or VHS anymore. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.|1
the movie is complete disaster. i don't know who write scripts for movies like this one, but i would definitely love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. perhaps script writers really don't know sh*t about situation in foreign countries in present or recent past? or they just don't give a damn and write everything that they think it's interesting.a great and everlasting formula with mad dictator + 1 lonely hero (an American of course) might seem like a good idea, but come on?!|1
This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway.|1
First off , the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I do n't understand how was possible , but I don't really know what this is :-( It seems as if , because I'm still confused , as if the problem can be solved by doing the editing on my screen . So in this film it seems to me as if there's something which is very important but not the right one which I'm afraid will not help , because as I said , it looks very bad . So is it possible for me to know what this is ?|0
I watched this movie knowing that it would be awful, but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with cruddy effects and HORRID acting. The lines in this...well...wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the English language. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good. You won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it.|1
"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called ""Big Fat Liar"". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from Hollywood, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie!"|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
Right... so you have a dam, tons of water (that seems to flow really really slowly) and a small town that happens to be right underneath the dams path of destruction. Throw in a profiteering glutton, an apparently mentally unstable and disgruntled architect and his son, and then to spice things up you add a weak plot and bad acting. All in all, when you have a look at this film from a paying customers point of view... I would feel extremely peeved off if this was a pay-per-view film. If you want a laugh... then you really need to watch this film.|1
You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way, this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one, but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars, and that's good because she's hot.|1
"This film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.I was expecting the usual Woody Allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but ""Sweet and Lowdown"" failed to provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unlikeable, that I do not want to now about him, or care about him. I wonder why a film about him has to be made. The pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore."|1
"Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big budget debacles like ""The Avengers"" and the remake of ""Diabolique"" has directed this ripoff of the Die Hard concept, done on - what looks like - a Blair Witch budget. A California nuclear reactor is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - the terrorists aren't Arab; they're really disgruntled American soldiers masquerading as Arabs! We find out that they don't really intend to blow up the reactor just make a statement. We're not sure what the statement is but never mind."|1
I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who . I 've played them over and over again! I'm not sure how I would describe them (or who the hell I would like to find out who they are or what it's about) but I can tell you a good story about a woman and her man. When the man and woman are together, the women are married, and she does her best to be with him and not with anybody else, and that's the way it works, right?|0
His music , especially what we hear of it here , is very slow . From around the time of writing a song we hear music as a genre . Music , especially when we are going back and forth , is a medium . Music , especially when we are coming back to a music place , is very slow . But music itself , which is what we listen to a lot , is a form of music , even before we are actually in it . But when we talk of music , it is not . Music is . It is not .|0
A real let down , the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for a better book than that. I loved this book so much I don't even think I could read it. I enjoyed every single detail of this book and it was very entertaining. You will find many other fantastic books in this series which is the best I have read in a while but I will have to give it a try. If you have enjoyed it please let me know the review link at the bottom of this post. The review link is listed below.|0
An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and inquires why Bill is following him.|1
**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of Larry Buchanan. This amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap-jack crime dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humdinger to say the least. Overlooking the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howler on a wide and round California lake.|1
Unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad.I admit it is not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.The acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and I'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible.|1
I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice on Friends. I could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy falling out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe then I could have gone for the ending. I think somebody needed to die in the execution scene.|1
It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly . It is no understatement to call it far superior. If this had been released in the film category (which I believe is the case in the US) its not worth it, as I would have had a shot at it at least, even if this had been shown in a different country. You don’t know much about Hollywood, so you probably won’t have a problem with it. I think that Hollywood should have given a different explanation about what it is.|0
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made . Huevos de oro seems to me the most interesting movie ever directed . He is very funny , very beautiful , very interesting , very intelligent , and I was so impressed by this movie . A great example is how he is playing the king of England , and this is a very good example and how he portrays himself . The King of England has a great attitude and he is very handsome , but when he looks at his friends , it is very difficult to explain to them that they are beautiful and he is a king of England .|0
"""Yesterday"" as a movie, is hard to rate. The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is gritty and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the Zulu. But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film."|1
"Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy, about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a popular magazine writer's family, at her farm in Connecticut. The problem is she has no husband, baby, or farm, as she writes about in her column, and she can't even cook; her wonderful recipes being provided for her by her good friend "" Uncle"" Felix, owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York City.Things get even more complicated when her strict publisher boss invites himself along for Christmas."|1
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is great.|1
"Yeah, what did I expect? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""American Pie"", which I liked a lot. I wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get?Attention, spoilers ahead!This film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before."|1
Although this has to be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode isn't badly written or acted. It's just that most of us looked to the X-Files for taut, gripping horror/thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, made Simpsons' Halloween Specials look like great thriller TV.In this episode Victoria Jackson of SNL fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker.|1
Wow . I just saw Demon Wind a little while ago , and I do n't think I 'll ever like him . but that is a good thing , I will try to keep him away . Yeah. I'm a little disappointed that he didn't come out this week or the next week. I'm a little disappointed that he has not posted to my page for the past few weeks. He did come out a little earlier than usual and has been posted a few times in the last couple weeks . I really like him .|0
This film has its detractors , and Courtney 's fey dresser may offend some folks ( who , frankly , don 't think it was made to wear.) I hope that you don't feel offended at 'trying to tell us where to go next.' This film has its detractors . I hope that you don't feel offended at us having to take it down for you . And please don't make me feel sorry for you , as it was never my idea. And I'd be sorry for anyone who made me make that film.|0
2005 was one of the best year for movies. We had so many wonderful movies, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence.....Coming up we also got Brokeback Mountain, King Kong....But if this year the only great movie that came out was Everything Is Illuminated, then we wouldn't miss all this year has brought. The first movie as a director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful, heart-warming, touching drama that also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles.|1
"Fox is pretty lame. They cancel the wrong shows. It's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written program like ""Arrested Development"" and yet they keep this show and ""War at Home"". I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy ""Married with Children"", but now it's just getting ridiculous. ""The Loop"" is a pointless and boring watch, and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpons"" work because there is a constant flow of jokes."|1
What can I say ? ? This movie has it all ... Romance , break-ups , rich kids , punks . In this new trailer we'll be discussing the relationship between the actress and her boyfriend. He is an amazing man who is not only a great husband but a beautiful man who will probably never have a second romantic partner and even though she is a good friend of his, she doesn't get to date him again. She has a number of beautiful boyfriends but she is a good friend. He is a very successful actor and actress who will probably be in the future as well.|0
Cruddy , innocent .. no smoking , drinking or bikers , but Jeremy Slate ( good actor ) and Jocelyn Bowers . On Monday night , I was in San Francisco and saw this video. I’ve been thinking about it many, many times, and decided I’ll take an hour and change my name when the video is finished. So…I decided I’ll take the name ’cause I’ll get a whole different name. What do we have in store for my new name? I’ve no idea.|0
This movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could see was going to be made in this style. It wasn't until a couple of days ago when I found a DVD copy for it that I decided to try it out. The DVD comes with all sorts of useful information about the movies and I can't wait to see how it came out. You can also get to see the DVD by downloading it on your computer or on your local DVD store and you can read an article about the movie on the website.|0
"There needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. It was painful to watch, but strangely compelling all the same. Compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much. I kept thinking ""it must get better."" It got worse. And worse. How on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk I'll never know. The most surprising thing of all though, is all these reviews I see of people actually loving the movie. Yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very very very bad."|1
This is an example of why the majority of action films are the same . Generic and boring , there can be no single action that you like. I can think of so many, but not many . But you have to pay to watch this, if you want that . A few years back I was doing a scene in a movie. The actors were going to tell us how the scene went and it all turned into a comedy. I watched it several times, mostly to try to avoid making fun of it.|0
In short this movie was awful.I understand it's a Disney movie, which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting. HOWEVER, i must say this is the worst of all Disney movies, with bad acting, LOTS OF IRRITATING SHRIEKING TEEN GIRLS(my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. Even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store.|1
In Everything Is Illuminated , Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer , a Jewish American who is looking for the woman he is dating and is searching for a new man to marry. He finds her, he searches the Internet for a man to marry, and there she is in front of the camera looking for anyone who can help him find a man. She is a very smart girl, but she is being forced into her life by the reality that she is not even Jewish. The woman is being forced into being a Jewish girl.|0
A buddy and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. Since that time, we rate movies based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst movie of all time. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. It isn't worth a second look that's for sure.|1
Oh , my . Oh , this is a * really * bad movie . The acting is absolutely atrocious . The storyline is atrocious . The plot is atrocious . In addition to the many faults with the characters, the main plot points have been the obvious ones . The plot has been the same from the previous films . The main characters, as they are, are really bad , but the main plot points , like the characters themselves , are also very bad , as well as the fact that it is difficult to distinguish the main story .|0
I can not stress how bad this movie is . This director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making a movie with no action, no dialogue, no sense of humor (except for being funny) and no characters, and made an even better film (even if not in its original form) with a twist, and the whole story is actually hilarious. That is not all. It is also funny. And I loved that the movie has some pretty funny moments too. And then there are all of the characters, and the action scenes are also funny.|0
This movie was boring. Very much like Underworld, only even less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film. The lead couple were boring. I totally didn't care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I didn't care about any character in the film. The plot was paper thin. The transformations were basically nil. I did like the wolves themselves, might as well have have done a wolf documentary, I would have liked that better. I wouldn't recommend this movie.|1
"I'm an action movie fan but until today I've never seen a preview or an ad for this movie in Italy, so I went to see ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" on pay-TV hoping for nothing special.But, what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem I found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, intriguing and funny action movie ever made.The transformation of Samantha/Charly from ordinary wife-teacher to cool-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. The action scenes and the stunts are the best I've ever seen."|1
A antique shop-owner in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley(Valerie Alston)gets put on a US District Court jury, on a trial of a known Mafioso Armand Asante(Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of Pirone attempting to get Whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. Much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with Willam Hurt as the go-between. Much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable.|1
"... why watch a TV drama ( billed as a comedy ) in which none of the characters are likable, the show was written by Steve Buscemi as a ""real"" real-life character. The script was intended to be based on the real-life comic series of the same name, ""Rise to Freedom"" by Stephen Sondheim , a writer and actor in the late 1960s. It's not clear how these characters got into this movie, but it was the first time this movie had been in existence, though the movie was never released."|0
Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would've given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai, India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse, the cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew.|1
It seems to me that a lot of people do n't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on steroids. I'm going to guess that I'm going to guess that, in most of the movie, I don't see it as being anything like Blade: The Master, even if I do see it in the Marvel movies, because then I've never seen one of these films. I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't shocked when you said there were some of the best superhero movies that never made any kind of use of the internet.|0
A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life. It could be set in any town in the UK. I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well.Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable.The actors are scarily believable, I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours. It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes.I loved the way this film was shot.Overall this film IS a must see.|1
This piece of Crap is actually the BOMB , as in Bottom of the Barrel . I ca n't figure how it was written, except that it's the most likely cause . I'll show it in a minute, but it's a good one if you don't know how to make it so . In the first part of the story, there's a lot of the same people that get killed. But the guy on the left, the bartender, has a very specific story, that the bartender had to write a few years before.|0
Everyone knows that late night movies aren't Oscar contenders. Fine. I mean I'll admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and figured I'd get to some skin-a-max. It's pretty bad when the info on the TV guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. It even gave it half a star. To be fair, I did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad. I couldn't stop laughing. I mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious.|1
"The original ""Psycho"" (1960) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of all time. The decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore, a little puzzling.The cast in the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as Bates."|1
I love most movies and I 'm a big fan of Sean Bean so I thought that I would at least make a few suggestions. I like to take pictures and I have a tendency to get them right in the end so I think they can be a little easier for me. So, I decided to use some of my favorite images in my video and I hope it will help you with that. I know you can make some really great movies with a little photography but that doesn't mean I can't use my camera in the video if that helps.|0
"In the 1940s , Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom , thanks to her sultry beauty and sensibility. She also appeared on the cover of the magazine ""The New Yorker,"" and she also appeared as a character in a series of short-form short stories, such as The Girl with the Hat on the Edge of Space and The Girl with the Hat in a Bottle . She was featured in many film magazines, including . Her career ended in the mid-1960s, after a series of setbacks, as she was unable to earn a large part-time income on her own."|0
This fantasy was utter garbage. I thought Michael Moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics of the British media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism. This movie is a left-wing loony's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. Anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid Bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. I'm sure it will do well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, though.|1
This is one of those strange , self-important , self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound . It makes the movie look just like a movie. The characters are so much more interesting and it feels so strange to have them all in a movie like this , even though I love the way they seem to me . I think this is what they have in store for all of them in the series . The best thing about this , I think, is the acting . The acting . I like the voice acting in this , I like the way they speak .|0
I saw this film in the movie theater . I was taking classes at the Second City Chicago and of course I’m a member of the class that you can read here. This is my second time to study in Chicago and the first time when I was a student in the city. My first exposure was to the City of Chicago where I lived. I had the ability to be a student in the community, and the experience of being able to do this in my own way was really very rewarding. I learned that if I could do this class at any time, it would be very rewarding.|0
The first thing you should know about `` Zipperface '' is that it was shot on video , so it doesn't necessarily look like a 'new' camera, but it does look very good. In addition to this, as mentioned earlier, it also has some great cameras that you can use to use as well, especially in high definition, and you can add more lenses to get the look you want! There is also a nice set of high quality cameras that are available, and it is pretty easy to create your own.|0
"This was shown on a premium channel, so I didn't realise it was made for TV. Even so, I like some of the movies on lifetime (Lifestyle here in UK), but this was awful. The family were so cheesy, ""Love you mum"" ""Love you even more honey"" Then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, ""Love you mum"" big cheesy smiles etc... She phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home."|1
As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager , I tend to watch all sorts of movies that are released in an online store, and the most important thing is that I do not have to get a lot of movies in my house. It seems that I have to do everything on my own, and that is why I am not able to go to my computer to watch my movie. However, I think that the movie store has made a big change in their management process, and this has reduced the number of the movie that I am allowed to watch.|0
"Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, the final of which is a sci-fi film, that nods strangely to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, and anime all at once. The robots are actually called ""replicants"", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner(several visual allusions to the film can be found as well) and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for ""heterosexual love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal""....martial arts fights ensue, a first for the dead or alive films."|1
"As horror films go, ""Rest Stop"", could have been better in many levels. Director/writer John Shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. Unfortunately, either he was not sure as to what to do with the material, or maybe, he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended, either by the studio, or the backers. Several endings have been included in the DVD, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best.The idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of California presents many possibilities at first."|1
"When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book `` Het Gouden Ei '' /the Het Gouden Ei'' in Paris, he replied: ''It's not so hard to make.'' George Sluizer

To make sure that the book had been received correctly and the publisher did not get an error message on the box, the book was marked as a book of French origin. The reviewer for The New York Times said, ''We are delighted by the book for its originality. The story is one of the most interesting of our books.''"|0
Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan 's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx , and what do you think it's like to have a good relationship with a fellow actor at the Oscars? Or, is there a way to create a new and better relationship between two actors, or what do you think would happen if the actor had a good friendship with the other actor? What do you think is the best possible way for them to meet each other? The Academy Awards are on the brink of having a great time together.|0
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them... The film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea... If this movie were remade with a few good actors/actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome... As for the actual film, I recommend watching the MST3K version, the pure version might be too boring to sit through, unless you love bad movies staring Martin Sheen's brother...|1
"Wow, Kiss the Bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. It sure was no ""Later Day Saints."" The movie sags in the center...perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film. But the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes - the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind.Even though ""Kiss"" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a made for TV movie. Every scene is lighted like a department store."|1
"This movie is all about reality, submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science. There were no computers giving exact enemy details, there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart, and a smile on their dial.People with expectations of seeing a ""pretty war"" in this movie will be grossly disappointed, .............. GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.War is not clean, exact, fought by people about to break into song."|1
"Y'know , it 's very interesting watching this ... half the people involved with it are now dead ... Anyways , when I saw the news online and read the latest ... news on this website, I was not disappointed."" ""I hope that I was not the only one, so I hope that it will have a lasting effect as you see the news."" ""Thank you, I appreciate you reading this article so much."" ""Yes."" ""I've heard from a lot of different sources, including all the media and the local news."""|0
I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it . Based on a true story , this is an incredible performance by an actor with a long hair. This is a great work and if I don't have time to work it in a few years I will. I'm not a part of the crew but I have been with it and have had it for a number of years. I think it's an amazing movie! I watched it on a mobile phone and they have a fantastic camera. The cinematography and the story are perfect, as always.|0
Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo . Beautiful scenery , beautiful sets of clothes . It shows how I am at work . I don't like that . I don't think I have any problems with them . I just like that I don't have to worry about it . I don't have to worry about what it is . But when I do, I have to worry about my work . But now I don't like to worry about it . I don't want to know it . I like the movie .|0
"A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a ""little man gets his chance"" movie, and it's a ""how far would you go?"" movie. Walter Mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. He fits right in as Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun horse bum. This movie gives you a rare screen glimpse of Lousiana Cajun horse drag racing. He has a young quarter horse who is a top racing prospect. ""had nothing but a filling station and a good horse."""|1
I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished writer and producer. He’s also been in the movies since his heyday (and his debut in the movie industry as well), but is generally considered to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture (“The Big Bang”), and a Tony award for best director (“The Great Gatsby”), and won a BAFTA for Best Performance by a Actress (“The King of Queens”) in 2014.|0
If ( as I just pointed out in THE GOAT ) Keaton is following the tradition of the comics finding a way out of the chaos of the comics world, I am a bit surprised by this. It doesn't seem as though he's an idiot. I'll just take a look at Scott, but it's pretty interesting. There are tons of other things that I'd like to do to improve the comic book's overall visual style. It's a lot of things that I've tried and tested.|0
"Four unhappy women leave dreary London to spend an ENCHANTED APRIL in a castle on the coast of Italy.Elizabeth von Hockenheim

It is no surprise that the men in the world now spend more time with their partners than they do in the last hundred years. There have been so many unhappy women in history since the dawn of time that a few years ago this story was told in a small volume. The story begins with a group of unhappy women, who, as they wrote in their last letters, are among the oldest survivors of the last century."|0
I am writing this review simply because I am a huge fan of the book , Prozac Nation , and hope it can be used in a different way. I am also curious as to if any of you would have any thoughts about the book, or maybe just want to take the time to go see it in person. So here it is, on the book page. I hope you enjoyed the review! Before I go any further, I would like to thank all my fans who support me, and to my fans who are still so supportive of Prozac.|0
This TV series is about a foolish and unconventional English gentleman who gets up to all sorts of merry mishaps.I have had a lot of fun with this TV series! You can get some of these in the next post. And here’s more of my favorites from that series. (If I can’t get them, why not share them here, too.) I’ve also included all the rest. This one is very interesting, but you don’t have to be a magician/dance instructor in order to get it. But I think it will be interesting.|0
While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years , there have always been rivals to their original formula, and it doesn’t stop there. These days, it’s the studio with the most talented talents in the world . If you’re interested in seeing more, check out the official website for the company’s animated films, and see if you have any other favorites you’d like to see.

"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous""."|1
A wonderful family movie & a beautiful horse movie. 75+ %entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters. The horses are real beauties.Has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense. Shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to.Andrew Rubin puts in a wonderful performance as Buddy,the sensible elder brother.|1
Caught this film on TCM in the early A.M . It was amazing.Starting out slow but ominously .... Scott is not the most interesting character,but I think his main strength is his action. I have been trying to get him out of the movie. The first time I watched it I just thought I was going too far in my career, and now I think Scott needs to learn that lesson. The movie was good and was enjoyable but it was a lot too short, and the acting was not as good as others who were making the movies.|0
Do NOT avoid this movie . Simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious . It possibly makes sense if the movie is based on someone other than yourself . If I was to go out and make a movie based on someone else as well . . There is a very good reason for this movie. Because it was a really great movie . It’s a masterpiece. It’s really very good. It is a great movie. It’s great . I really don’t want to comment on this film . But this is a great movie .|0
"I thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of ""national security."" The show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. After a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and I started watching reruns of House Invaders on BBCAmerica instead."|1
I love cheesy horror movies , I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party are also a great way to go about things. I really like to think that one day it will all be new to everyone. If not then I’ll wait for another year and wait for it to die, but not for sure. If it turns out to be the right movie, then that’s what I think. If not then I will wait and hope it does not come out.|0
In the 1980s in wrestling the world was simple . Hulk Hogan would take on Roddy Piper , or Bobby Bowdish , and he would try to change the way wrestling worked. In 1982 the world was made more accessible to people. In 1989 Hogan was asked to represent Canada at the United Nations . Hogan was invited to return to the US to represent Canada, but the United States decided it would not be for that. It was a decision that was overturned by a court . Hogan was invited back to America as a member of the International Wrestling League of America  to represent Canada at the 1982 World Wrestling Championships .|0
Sony Pictures Classics, I'm looking at you! Sony's got the rights to Harry records -- you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog! Anyhow, this is a great study of a fascinating musician, woefully underknown, full of great stories, greater music, and it could have been 3 hours longer and I'd have loved it even more. Saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, where it played to a packed house. They were turning people away at the door!|1
After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew, but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise, I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential.|1
Mute Witness is a modest, yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since the production costs are cheaper there, a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia for shooting a horror film.|1
"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious ""Southern belle"" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister."|1
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy , self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the game, they went the extra mile and started talking about how creepy they were . “I can’t believe that the only person I’ve ever told people that was a scumbag was one of them. That’s all I ever told people, and people that didn’t know, that I’ve been talking about since. And I have never, ever had any doubt that, and that’s all I’ve ever said.|0
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they been filmed at all, just as he was on the screen the first time. For more than a year, the director had been putting his movies out on Blu-ray. He'd been waiting for a new project to get out on the big screen. That didn't work for him back when he was a big-time filmmaker, but when it did come out that he was in a film that was not just about his films, it made sense for him to stay ahead of the fray.|0
Very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. It is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect I found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. The first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something I've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. After 30 minutes I got the idea and wished they could just get on with it.|1
This version of David Copperfield is dreadful from start to finish. I knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment Attenborough and Olivier camp it up as two baddies. It was all downhill after this. Aunt Betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for.The worst of the worst was the producer's choice for Uriah. This was the music hall version of this character, previously and admirably played by Roland Young. And what was all this self-absorbed Angst from David.|1
"Just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie . This movie gives out horrible messages to those who read it . There's a whole lot of little things that are horrible but that's all I can add to them. The movie, I'm not going to spoil you for your reading comprehension, but you can see it with the comments below and here. I mean, there's lots of great stuff on it and it's just a good read. If you've been watching the film you'll know a lot. This movie is called ""The Nightingale""."|0
I received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know I'm a big fan of low budget Horror flicks. Kaufman Studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered. I loved to watch their films at home on rainy nights with my family...until I saw Bugged...WHAT HAPPENED?This Movie started out with a pretty good concept about mutating bugs and even added some slick comedy but overall the writing is just bad and that was mistake number one. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to first be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker.|1
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I 've seen in more than twenty years.It is the best-known Indian film and is the main antagonist of Indian film industry for some years.It has made a number of commercial breakthrough films such as the G-Star movie and the Indian Cinema Film in India. One of my favourite films has been that of Anup Ghandari, who is widely seen on the West Coast, but who has been very popular in North America in the recent years. It has been recently seen in India again.|0
Terribly disappointed with CITY OF MEN after being swept away by CITY OF GOD. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline, and instead, in its place, is bland predictability with the obvious attempts at audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what is should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping shots of the Rio coastline, etc) at the expense of a gripping story and characters.|1
This show is terrible. I cannot get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. This is not entertaining improvisational acting, it's just a cheap attempt to throw someone famous comedic actors onto a stage and have them perform a poorly improved scene. I have actually done improv work as an actor, and this show is not improv.What the audience is actually laughing at (if they're actually laughing at this show at all, it looks quite fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star being lost like a deer in headlights.|1
Chupacabra: Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. I had expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, I can honestly say I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially.Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. To say that he just showed up would be an understatement. But at least he did show up.|1
"I had read up on the film and thought it would be cute , a feel good Saturday night movie. I was not in it, I was not watching it . I was just a bit confused and had not been watching it . It had so much action , the music, a lot of laughs , but I found this movie interesting and thought I might like to go back , or watch it , for some time to watch the movies

This is great and I really want to see it again , I am trying to remember the film but the sound is terrible so I think I am missing something ."|0
'Do n't Look In the Basement ' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is a very clever chap. You are not allowed to use it if you are not going to do anything else. However you use it you are not allowed to look at it so if you look it once it has been taken out of your head you should be able to look it again now that it has been used up you should be able to get a better picture of it. I am sorry but I am not allowed to do anything more than that so I do not think it really matters.|0
Review: Nunsploitation films. They've been around since forever. A few that pop to mind are the Mexican devil worshiping movie Alucarda, Night of the Demons 2, The Convent and of course Dante Tomasellis Desecration. Cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. If done right, it works. Here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled The Nun.The story is about this group of girls that live in a Catholic school. In this school there's a Nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls.|1
One of the best of the 'kitchen-sinks'. Fantastic views of London and invaluable snippets of working class life of the 60's. Loach's eye seems to capture everything, yet makes no judgment - a taste of things to come. As with 'Kes', 'Riff-raff' and 'Sweet Sixteen', it serves as a cinematic social history of Britain. Carol White is completely convincing, you love her, fancy her, want to take care of her, but hold your head at her self-destructive decisions and still follow her in some vain hope.|1
This movie was painfully awful . Most of the movie consisted of people running in the woods , walking thru woods , walking through hills , walking through mountains , looking at the hills . Some of the scenes were actually shot in close-ups . So what are some things I do not understand about this movie . And I know I could say this about a lot more but I know there are some people who actually have a better view of what this movie was. This movie is just horrible . All of the shots were horrible.|0
"Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation, which recounts the period of Charles Darwin's life prior to the publication of ""On the Origin of Species"" in 1859, his infamous, world changing tome on evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research created an enormous rift, a schism between the believers of his day and scientists. He was said at the time to be going to war against God, and even to have ""killed God"".The film revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his extremely devout and loving wife."|1
What a waste of talent -- although it appears that Crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid, self- absorbed, character-less character he portrays in this disappointing movie.In art, sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content. What this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory/competing, unresolved impulses/consciousness of the film's director/writer. It unintentionally shows the LACK of awareness that a truly evolved, deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy OR the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience.|1
i don't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the acting to the props to the story that it makes you angry. This is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and that is saying a lot because i have seen some bad ones. when i saw this movie i knew it was a blade knock off, but i thought that hey its got kung fu and vampires, a combination that i thought could not fail. That is until i popped this into my DVD player.|1
"This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Sure, it's fluff, it's not ""relevant"", but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely ""A Good Thing"" as Martha Stewart(appropriately)would say! Barbara Stanwyck is so appealing in this film and Dennis Morgan perfectly compliments her. Both of them have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the 40's and 50's--Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z."|1
This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction . I thought that it would be good for a few decent people to know that you don’t write your own novel. It would also help to have you read your debut novel out of a random bookshop or one of the libraries in your neighbourhood, and have someone look at it for you. I hope you can enjoy it and enjoy reading it! If you have any comments or queries about Pulp Fiction or anything of the sort, please feel free to reach out at [email protected] or [email protected] or on Twitter: @PFParx.|0
"River 's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer Neal Jimenez.It is based on an interview with the author of a memoir about his experiences of living in New York City. About Neal Jimenez

When you're on a trip to New York from a hotel, you can get to the airport and fly to your own destination by yourself or you can spend the night at a motel. And you can travel to your own hometown in New York City. But you can make your own choices. And if you can't make a decision, you can make your own way."|0
Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners. If you think you’ve got your eyes set on this one you’re a little too late! As much as it might make me feel nostalgic for the movies of the ’60s and ’70s, it just wasn’t for me yet! As much as it might really help to know what the world of cinema is like today, I’ll keep it up for you as it is in the spirit of it’s origin, that is, the film industry.|0
Of all the movies in the history of movies I ca n't imagine someone sitting down and saying , I have a problem with this one. I'm the one who thinks I should not have an opinion about anything and I'm not an expert when it comes to opinions. I know that for a guy who doesn't know anything, I don't have a problem with a movie that I don't have a problem with, but I think there's a problem that's really bothering me, and that I need to make a difference on my own.|0
An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins, comes the Following, a movie about a man who follows other people for inspiration of characters in stories he writes. One man he follows, he decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he bargained for.Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directing producing and otherwise completely making this movie entirely on his own with almost no budget and produced independently, this movie is much more than you'd expect.For anyone who likes Memento and complex twists, turns, shocks, and messing around with time, this is definitely a movie for you.|1
Wow , Kiss the Bride was n't that bad , but it was n't that good either . It sure was . . . a little bit bad. . . . I don't mean to imply that . . . but . . . Oh, I forgot about that girl. But . . . I'm just saying . . . I know I wouldn't be surprised if something happened to her . . . that's what it would have been . . . Dude, I want to do it right now. I'm in the same boat as you and the guy .|0
"Though often considered Peter Sellers ' worst film , it is in fact an excellent send-up of medical corporate corruption , especially in regards to the former chief executive of the National Security Council . In an effort to keep the public from knowing what happened to him - and indeed to expose him in public - , the film was put out a couple of days ago , which was an indication of how much of an attention he pays to the film. Sellers himself has stated that "" I think the movie deserves a lot of time, and it's an excellent film."""|0
I recently rented this promising mini series , I did n't even know they had adapted it for television . The idea of the mini series was to allow people to have a chance to see them. I wanted to show that we are living on a planet, and we have been for years and years now. If there is nothing new to tell us about our planet , I will just show you that the mini series had been a wonderful idea. I can't explain how I became interested. I used to live in the U.S., but didn't have the money to pay for the series.|0
"This film is just as bad as `` The Birdman of Alcatraz '' . I do not refer to the original film in this way. There are two things here:

The bird is very, very, very bad. They don't like birds at the time. Not a very good thing for a young bird of the period that you have in your family. If you get the chance to eat them, it may be an even worse thing. You need to give them more than they deserve to eat. You must give them more than you get."|0
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube. For a low-budget effort, it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly, the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad. The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and I'm not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy.|1
I love this movie. It is the first film Master P have ever done. It is based on the story of his life. It is low-budget, but it is very good. It shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans.Not only did Master P start in this movie, he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it. This movie shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him.|1
I kept waiting for the film to move me , inspire me , shock me , sadden me in some way but never before . I got a letter from my dad, asking me to come out and see him and his sister for a night. I told him that I knew him, and told him I would come out. He was kind enough to accept my letter. I got to talking with him about it and what I needed. After a couple of hours of the film, it was time to go to the bathroom and take off my shirt and pants.|0
Philistines beware, especially American ones! This has all the elements you'll hate - a langorous approach to film language, a painterly sense of composition, an intense homoerotic focus to its elegant narrative, a wonderful and unusual use of music and, even worse, it's based on a story you'd probably hate as well... If, however, you do feel that films don't to have derivative plotlines, be full of action and crappy dialogue, don't need the visual grammar of MTV/TV Commercials, then watch this.|1
If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man 's testicle , or look at a row of pathetically unimpressive images that you've never seen before? I'm sure you'll agree that most people have a good time when it comes to examining other people's body parts, especially when viewing their own images, which is when you can see how a man is behaving. You can also find some examples on the internet about how a particular man may not even look as you've seen them when looking at other bodies, including his genitals.|0
'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor. Jane (Lewis) has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother, and per agreement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low renting rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a creepy weather man) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. So she moves in, and weird stuff starts happening, and because this is a B-grade horror flick, there's a dumb, not-to-be-found-in-reality reason why.|1
In Sweet Water, the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is constructing a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the Katonahs. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in a ditch in the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton like creature known as Bone Eater and their bones are devoured by the monster. The half-breed Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers, being pressed by Krantz to arrest the protesters.|1
I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did.Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such an unlikable character that I found it hard to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie.Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda, Gary's romantic interest.|1
First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. They didn't have to predict the bombing.Second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? They were killed *before* the surgery took place! Third - how the heck did Lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? Fourth - why did the Japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the use?|1
"""My Blue Heaven"" is boring. The plot is insipid; the characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, while occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright, and emotionally hollow to the core. The leads, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here.There's really only one reason to watch ""My Blue Heaven""."|1
"When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought ""god, this is horrible!"" But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do but search out for the Stella shorts which I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. When I found them not only were my dildo expectations met, but I found probably the greatest comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs."|1
OK, I saw this film through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I did see the movie, so I figured I would leave a comment on it. I just love once again how Joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the Oscar winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. It seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities.|1
"It's a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release. That many movies suck is no surprise, but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time, the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts. Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that ""Aeon Flux"" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above. Though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws, it at least has (sort of) an idea with which to toy around."|1
Being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club(this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans) I am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint. Afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves.The story is simple enough. In short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants. Luckily there's a few monkeys(chimpanzees) that have a bounty on their head that would get Boba Fett or Dog's(Duane Chapman) blood flowing.|1
***SPOILERS*** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. A sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the New Guinea jungle. What follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed. The cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing. The cast are awful except for Janet Agren as the female lead who is excellent.|1
Of course I am going to think it was a great movie . I recognized several people I did n't know well but there were also a few that made me laugh about it. It had all sorts of good humor. I loved it. I will definitely be buying it for my birthday in November. Thank you so much. That's pretty great. I watched the movie in the theater and I was just laughing about it! The movie was a bit intense, but I think I got the feeling you were in love with it.|0
"This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema . This is an introduction to the book, which was one of the greatest films in its genre. In this chapter, we will be looking at a few of his films and their relationship with their protagonists. This book would be suitable for short films only, but we would also recommend it for longer films. We have also included a review of Krzysztof's film ""Szędziłow"". Chapter 1

A film is a book that has been carefully reviewed and accepted by the director of a particular film."|0
Dreadful. I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this. I just finished watching the film, BTW.I love good cross genre films. This isn't one of them. Show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action flick, I'll watch them all. But you cannot just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling, camp, schlock-horror fest and draw my applause.I love philosophical films. This isn't one of them. Anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film hasn't read a good book lately.|1
I kind of like JAG. It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non American) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much.I don´t like that Rabb and MacKenzie goes from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of the TV show) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents. Its almost like watching a recruitment video from the US army.I still watch the show, so it´s not that bad. But i would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigates military accidents and don´t save the world in the future.|1
I saw this last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and holy god was it bad.. From the script to the editing to the acting to the cinematography-- none of it worked. Not to mention the set design/costumes were so distractingly wrong for the time period (it spans the years from the late 70s up until 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who's usually an amazing actor, was so over-the- top ridiculous. Granted, Quinten Crisp is an over-the-top guy to begin with, but Hurt was given nothing to work with here.|1
What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Incoherent, not cohesive...utterly ridiculous. One of the most talented/beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single memorable line here. Worse, she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop. The best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor Peter Coyote lives in.|1
The film Soultaker is essentially an older form Final Destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies, all because they’ve had too many years of “real” TV and movies. Soultaker, which premiered at Cannes last week, has been released to a limited-edition hard-drives package in Europe on April 15. It’s the first feature film released in Italy by the Italian film studio. Read on for the full review, which also gives a short clip to show you how Soultaker plays. What does it all mean, for you, what does it mean for you?|0
"Too much stock footage (almost one third of this 53 minute film) really slows this one down. Granted that the plot is that John Weston (John Wayne) is sent by Marshall George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say ""Ro-DAY-oh""), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the Bad Girl (usually a Latina-- even in the great ""Duck Soup"" [1933]) and the 'heroine' Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young look-alike (hey! it's her sister!)"|1
Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies , and a third one is planned for its 2nd season in Japan . It comes about during the 4-part series in Japan. In this series, there is an opening and closing sequence , which is not in the Japanese language , as it is in English. However, there is a main opening , where a lot of the main actors and actresses go in for the finale , which is different from what has been in the anime series in the world of anime.|0
What bird is that ? A maltese falcon. The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines hair. Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. The reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous, an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - This film is what the title suggests...|1
Take your video camera , turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights, in order to film your home and your neighbors’ pets. With the camera, your home can be filmed with even the most expensive lights. And, you should also think about getting a digital camera to record your video. This is the key reason why most video camera manufacturers have to buy expensive cameras for their devices. With so much information, it’s hard to tell if a new video camera will have a camera at all.|0
Boy Oh Boy , does this movie stink . This movie is one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever read. It's one that I love and hate, and I do not like when I read it because I don't realize how much I dislike it so much. I love the music and lyrics, the story and all the music, but it is so terrible. My only regret is that it is a film I love so much. The movie is so great, the music is so perfect, the storyline is so brilliant.|0
"`` Hood Rat '' is absolutely terrible . This is a urban version of `` Willard '' . I just can't find the right word, but they're the worst! I've never seen a guy who has this style in all his work. They're the best we have had so far...

''' Hood Rat '' looks like it was a very rough job, but that's not it . '' ''' Hood Rat '' sounds like it had a rough time. But there was some great music to get through that first week of training. '''"|0
The sound is terrible , the picture is worse than worse , the acting is awful , the female leading actress is awful , the lead singer is so horrible she will have no idea of what it feels like to play such a beautiful person . This is the terrible thing about the film: there are too many women on the screen who are not even aware that they are female and the actresses who are not even aware of them have no problem with them playing beautiful men . If I saw a movie that I liked and watched it once or twice in the past decade I might think it was horrible.|0
I am a firm believer that a film, TV serial or any form of art should and would be fully appreciated once the timing factor- as to when written, produced or conceived-should be taken in to account.Yeh Jo hai Zindagi is one such series. I remember watching it in the mid-80's on TV and the re-runs via the video cassette libraries during early 90's. and laughing out loud and being addicted to it. That made me buy the full series DVD set and surprise of surprises- the comedy and the moments of the good 'ol days simply fell flat for me.|1
At least for me . I have been following the career of Mr. Almdovar since the beginning and I was very impressed with him in his ability. He had a very good career, with very high grades, good grades, he did very well and had the talent of his time. I would say that Almdovar is quite a young man. He had to have a lot of time, a lot of money, he was very young. He was a very good kid but he wasn’t a good player, so he couldn’t get the job of a player.|0
"This movie is not the scariest of all time, but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget, no stars, lots of inventive death scenes, and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A nice starting point for ""Just Say"" Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This film won't be seen by many, but for fans of 80's horror it's a must."|1
Okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. For example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. So, does he ask his father for the dough? Nope, he STEALS IT and gets caught. Kids, if I'm ever turned invisible, I'll advance your allowance, ok?|1
There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar . Its so nice to see this wonderful art. I don't remember how it all came together but I guess I think that this is what makes the best art for the world and what makes Disney a better artist. You see, when you first look at the world, you may find this world and you may find that there is something special and it is not Disney but Pixar. I do not know if that makes me a Disney or not but I am still looking for it.|0
This film is great ! Being a fan of `` The Comic Strip Presents ... '' I just knew I would like this movie! You can get more of the movie by visiting the website or at the movie website. If you have a favorite movie and you want to see more of the trailer, check it out on the Internet. If you like the movie with the trailers, then you can also visit my site, or on my website (www.thecomicsstrip.com) at the movie page. I have a few good reviews on these films.|0
If there's anything worse than this movie I don't want to see it. I remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should blast away any notion that Peru is a vacation paradise. The whole thing is so awful that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison. This film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.|1
The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s, film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951}, and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored, and often censored, by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures, though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years.|1
First of all, I personally adore Demons and Demons 2, I saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in Russia when I was a kid, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. Then I heard nothing about Mr Bava. Then I saw his Ghost Son. Well, it is certainly not a good coming back! Why was the leading character, whom we never really knew to at least like him, in accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul?|1
"Stanley Stupid ( Tom Arnold ) and his wife , Joan , like to sleep in bed with their heads on their heads, without any feeling of being apart of it, and she's just as obsessed on the idea as he is. She sleeps with him, though. So, is it worth it for him or her? Monday, September 16, 2010

On another post that I wrote this afternoon, I noticed some of the most amazing things I have found in the last two years:

1) I've been feeling really guilty for starting this post with a post I wrote just a day before."|0
"Though it's better than most made-for-TV movies, ""Buried Alive"" is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill revenge tale. There are so many plot holes in this one, it makes you wonder why the screenwriters didn't go through a series of re-writes. The ending has a nice twist to it, but it's hardly believable.The acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh is terrific, as always, but Tim Matheson hams it up with cheesy one-liners that reminds one of Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"". Don't bother with this one."|1
This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare . I was trying to convince my family and I to come and watch the game with my kids. I could not convince my father to get help to get my hands on a computer so I came back and watched it . I had also seen some games that I did not even know about but it did not help my father to get help and I could not convince him to get it . I also did not know if it would work for FarCry as my dad told me.|0
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review . unfortunately , both times i was moving i had to stop and move my laptop but i am not too worried about it, i just cant get it to work . but it is just the last one to me that is the problem : ive had some bad news in the past. i am working on a new laptop but it isnt working ive been moving and i was about to have another laptop when i came home. but when i opened the new laptop it is not showing any of the reviews.|0
Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V. movie based on the Peter Kurth book, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It keeps up historically pretty much, names are changed etc. But sticks to the real story quite well. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royals, Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra. What stuck out in my mind was the all too short portrayals by Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all it was a pretty classy production with some fine acting.|1
"I probably have to blame myselfbut I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title ""Black Dragons"" and revolves on secret WWII conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge. This film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure. The actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end, but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one."|1
Thank God I have fast-forward . I think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls . . . I’ll put you in a trance . I’m just trying to get you thinking about what’s going to happen. The way I see it, this guy can fall and then I can just fall again. It would be good to come up with some other movie that you think will really work . . . Then the story would have to be told, but it would have to be told in its own way . . .|0
"Even if you're not a ""theatre person,"" I highly recommend that you see this. Based off of a play of the same name by Christopher Bond (which, in turn, had been based off of an old London legend), Sondheim did a wonderful job bringing it to the musical theatre stage. The score is just amazing-- by far Sondheim's best, and probably one of the best scores written for a musical ever. The show was cast extremely well, my only complaint being of Betsy Joscelyn's portrayal of Johanna."|1
A 1957 Roger Corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is unleashed. It's the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women, (one an unmarried virgin the other a Las Vegas show gird who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) Time passes, tensions develop (or are supposed to). Something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster!|1
It 's 1913 . A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood 's next great star! “The one thing I would have said was I would have said no”, he said, when asked about her recent role in the “Sketch Film” in which she made an appearance. The actress who was recently to star in the “Sketch” film is now “in charge” of her career. This has led to her being featured in a new version of the film, but the actress said, “I didn't think of this as a choice”.|0
Assy McGee is an out-of-control , hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas . His main duties include interviewing and analyzing suspects, investigating crimes, and investigating murder and suicide. The main characters are himself and the various police department officers who work at the time of the killings. During his interview with Detective McGee, one of the characters is shown as a woman in a black dress with red lipstick and sunglasses. He explains that she is very beautiful, but she also has a red mouth, which is very noticeable in her beauty.|0
As I watched this movie , I felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. It seemed to move around a lot, but was eventually swallowed up. Then I felt a little more. I know this is a stupid question, but I would like you to feel this. This is going to make me feel great, and I feel like it’s the best thing I've ever done in my life. This is what I want to say, and I want to say it. What does a “bunny,” like your name, feel like?|0
"I 'll give it a two because it has a lot of music , otherwise it would be a one.I'm going to be very careful not to be overly worried about the other one.I've heard more and more of that than I thought, so if I'm wrong in my analysis it's probably better to be more specific and try different ideas to see what's going on. A:

In general, music should be described in some way or other. I've heard of music that makes music sound good or bad and it can make it even better."|0
"Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country, which is always the Northern part. If black people were shown this way, there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons.This is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the ""clever"" farce clichés. But it's mostly tiresome. A gangster comedy, with the bad Russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) Finns. And most stupid of all is of course the Norwegian, according to Stockholm prejudice.Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality. This is not funny."|1
Check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense has n't yet kicked in . We get a pretty good view of what we are in and we end up with some good information . I can see that you were right and I think it is more than just your average TV. But if you are on a really good budget, then you might want to consider doing some shopping . I've done that in the past but I wanted to make sure that I have an opportunity to see that I don't have to change my mind . . .|0
"Death Camp Opera : Right Here , Right Now ! Ten years ago , I read that a very special person named Dr. Alistair Hall would be able to perform ""The Last Camp Opera"" and I couldn't tell whether he was right or not. I think he thought the song was a good one and I think it made me a little bit more relaxed and happy. He was a brilliant composer and I don't know that many people would even consider it as a great song. However, I couldn't find it in the English version."|0
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on. The action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content. The uniforms and weaponry of both the U.S. and German troops were perfect. The costumes and weaponry of the Berbers were perfectly accurate as well. This film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting Roosevelt shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful. Procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for.|1
What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film ? Are they expecting classic cinema that is similar to the kind of cinema that you get at the cinema cinema? Is it just because the audience is as different from the movie as the movie itself is? “I’m surprised,” said Michael Keating. “It was the film I watched, I saw it, I was really shocked. “It was the thing I loved the most about it, and the way it went, ‘I know, I’ve done this before.|0
OK , this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments , but there are a couple more of things I would love to see here in the next few days. I have a few things to be proud of and things that I want to see in this project. 1) I have a feeling this is all possible because I am going to make it all happen as a movie. I am still not convinced I know how to do this. It seems like I'm going to be getting too much information, but maybe it is just me.|0
This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera very slowly and gradually tilts down, then moves back up into place again. The sound is crackly, and occasionally fades out then in again. In another scene, the camera man is just visible in a mirror.Then came the scene with instructions how to put down a tent... which, believe me, went on for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either. In my opinion these were just to fill out the movie and make it longer.|1
"Film critics of the world, I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However, my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly. You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat."|1
It´s long time that I and my wife didn´t see such a boring thriller. It´s definitively NOT a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. This could be instead a very low budget TV crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss Pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. Okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don´t miss anything. We gave 4/10.|1
"I think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film , since it is padded to hell by all the noise they are making . Edit:
I was surprised to see that, but I can't say that this is a good film at all. I know this isn't a movie I'd recommend, but it's obviously not a film I would buy. There are still many people who have been working on this, and they've got a lot to talk about, and that's why they're putting it on here."|0
Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I guess it had it's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows. The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE!, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short lived t.v. series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more. The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending.|1
First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book . So of course , I have some personal friends who are like that. My friends , who I love to think of as friends . They are always looking for peace. I know a couple who are . They are always on the go. When they have the peace , they don’t think about what that peace is. In this book, I’ll talk about all the ways in which our friendship has made our life more meaningful and enjoyable. You’ll find all the ways in which our friendship has changed our life.|0
"This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it."|1
"Fred Williamson, one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars. Cynthia Rothrock, one of the two or three top American female action stars. Imagine a film with these two together for the first time! Now imagine THE WORST film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. Welcome to ""Night Vision"". Of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction."|1
This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Its been a few years since I saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. It tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'Nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. Whatever you do, don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way! !|1
I have just seen Today You Die . It is bad , almost very bad.1 ) The direction and editing direction of this page is not really helpful .2 ) This page might be helpful for some if i am reading a lot of blogs , and i just can't figure out the reason !3 ) The number of pages of your website has not really changed .4 ) You have not given me any useful information , even when i'm reading your blog , its all about the comments , it seems to be going down , so i just keep going up .|0
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie talent in the movie industry. Well, we have some excellent film talent in Australia and we have some great Australian film talent out there. I am a little confused with some of my thoughts. How can the Australian media do that? How can the Australian film industry do that? Aussie talent has such a huge reputation that there are people to talk about it because there are a great many talented Aussie talent out there.|0
"Started watching this but did n't believe in any of the characters . In particular the relationship between the bakery operator and the baker. I just wanted to see if I could find something to do, I have read it and I think this is very helpful. Answers

I just happened to stumble to this film and checked IMDb for more information: Score 6,7, well... not so bad. Genre: scifi...good I like scifi. So I got the movie and I was looking forward to have a relaxing Sunday evening watching it. But but...NO.As in summary, this isn't a movie at all. It is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about Jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. Movie starts with a epic abduction story: Driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... Well, actually that was the film.|1
"Certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason you should never pay attention to them. This film is a perfect example. The critics like director Eric Rohmer.This movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager (""Pauline"") she's taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with a few men. It's talk, talk, talk and more talk. For those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless French morality play."|1
Some movies you watch and you say , `` Well , that made no sense . '' And you do not want to do this. But, when you do it, it makes no sense. So, you think it makes sense. And then when you do this, you do it. But, you are not sure. I do not think it does it. It only makes sense. Because if you do it then it is just not really. If I do it right, then it is just not real.|0
I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on, who I liked in movies like Boogie Nights, and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. I do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and I'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. The acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid.|1
"Christian Propaganda ... Lots of fear mongering ... This is not SciFi , this is ChriFi ( Christian fiction ) . ChriF is about what goes around and what doesn't go right . ChriF is about what happens around and what doesn't goes wrong . ChriF is about who gets to be there . This is why we need Christian fiction ( fiction ) . So we want to show that God's people have power and control in their midst . It is called the ""power"" ( power ) . ChriF is not just a fictional novel . It's a book full of power."|0
The final entry in the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual wasters go about their business in Wales. I feel sure the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the screenplays made him look bad in comparison, and so no more were made. It's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism - a woman running for the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason whatsoever. Still, it does at least make Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but then what doesn't?|1
I enjoyed very much the movie wooden camera . I think it 's a little bit influenced by the Brazilian model. It is just a bit a little different, I mean, I think it could have a more traditional feel, and that's all that matters, though. Maybe I'm a bit biased, but I would have thought Brazil is a bit like Brazil at the other end of the spectrum, it could have been a bit more modern, but it's also a lot like the US. I'd just say Brazilian is pretty different from Brazil at some points.|0
This film stinks more than limburger cheese ! If you find this at a garage sale , LEAVE IT THERE ! It is a very good film that people want to try on their faces to make a good movie. They want to know that it is beautiful , just the way it is made . And it has this beautiful picture . The first time we saw it was in the movies, and that was the first time. I had no idea, but this was what it was. It was just a film, which was like the first time that I did a movie, and it had a beautiful picture.|0
I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie. I actually ran across this movie by accident. I was taping another movie on Showtime one night, overnight and this movie came on afterward. So I sat and watched it and boy was I blown away. The acting is absolutely superb. Kathy Bates...who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values (religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family.|1
You'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in Hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible TV movie. This movie is an exercise in over-acting (very bad over-acting) to situations that made out to be more than what they are. I won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. The only plus is seeing Marcia Brady running around in a bikini!|1
"When the circus comes to town and places the lion 's cage directly over Bugs Bunny 's home , Bugs Bunny may be the first man to be a hero , but when the circus takes place in the wild , Bugs Bunny may be the first man to be a winner ! Bugs Bunny died on the first day of production on his birthday at the time of his death , at 4.00 pm. After a few days of working his way out of the cage to the door, the lion ""s death was over-whelming and caused him to fall down on his back."|0
"In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock, it's apparent that Big Al's fear from the police dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. The note said: ""He's been naughty, imprison him for an hour."" The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police. ""Strangers on a Train"" is probably one of the best in his ""wrongly-accused"" series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. That's the same author who wrote the Ripley series."|1
The threesome of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. With the outbreak of World War I, the threesome enlist and pursue Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. The second half concentrates on action sequences as the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat.|1
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script that made it look like it might be made better than it is and the way in which it was done. I’m not alone, of course, as my father’s work was often well received by film critics who found him more ‘progressive’. But I was very happy to see some great work from an actor who has gone all the way back. I was not only delighted with the film, but pleased with the result.|0
"Awesome Movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a HUGE fan of David Duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie! I would love to see him in more movies of this nature. His talents are definitely under-used and has SO much more to offer besides ""Agent Mulder"" (although I'm a huge fan of that series too), Anyway, I want to see more of him. He is easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST! Great love story that shows love never dies... it's with you forever."|1
Saw this at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, over three years ago. I went in with no expectations since Christopher Nolan was a no-name at the time, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at that festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting the scenes out of sequence adding to the mood. Mr.Nolan gave a good account of its making at the end, enough to put anybody off starting out as a film-maker! I liked it better than Memento although this was, perhaps, due to the lower expectations.|1
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a.|1
"Since I 'd bought the DVD , I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of enjoyment. This was the beginning of what I hope I'll describe as what I'll talk about when I finish the book. A couple of years later I was working on a book that I thought might be useful as an academic book for the humanities, and I was able to put it into practice. In the beginning I was writing about how to create a website that might be a little different from the more traditional ""web"" website."|0
This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made . Following are the plus points of this film. The most important is that its cinematography is extremely crisp and precise, it is so effective, that it is very difficult to see it properly in the frame. It doesn't take any serious effort to watch the film in front of the camera, but rather it is there in the film. It can be watched for hours, and is very readable, which makes for a very entertaining film.|0
Everyone 's already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a lot more on-line knowledge than you do, and weren't sure what you were doing. So let's start from the first point of view, and then go in another direction, because you need to do a whole lot more. You might have to try a lot to make it easier for you, but in the meantime, I'll just let you have it as you would if I just said it was a good one.|0
If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.Life was slow then, compared to now.|1
I'D BUY THAT FOR A DOLLAR!! !I did buy this film for a dollar and I've seen much worse for much more! !This is a Scottish sci-fi film from Mark Stirton and according to the Making of (hysterical by the way) the production only cost $8000. Eight grand!!! That wouldn't pay for half a minute in Hollywood!! Nevertheless ---- This is top fun film making. If you like things gritty then you're in for a treat. These are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing.|1
"Estevez , Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are superb in this portrayal of a Vietnam vet home from the war, and this could be the film where he and his team will be able to play in the main battle of the war. For more information see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?time_l=4_0b2e_8m3d&v=6e0f_3e9c&t=23&h=39. We are so proud of this movie...

We also know that this was a great movie in its own right. We know that they have some great actors who will have great actors and some great writers. But what about the writers that are in this film?"|0
OK, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments, but there are a couple of items I wish to add. The mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that, fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They're easy to tell apart.|1
I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here . but I really did not find this movie to be a bad movie . . . I did think the film was a great film but it was a bit too long. . . and if we were to go into this movie with nothing to prove , we wouldn't even be seeing the movie . . but it would be great to see something similar for the second time . . . I have many other ideas about this movie but it is probably not worth the time to get it to the point where it's great .|0
"Loosely based on actual events, ""River's Edge"" is a film, much in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends, but no one does anything about it for a long time. With top notch acting by Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we are able to forgive the average acting by everyone else in the film.The film begins with a young boy, Tim (Joshua John Miller), dropping a doll off of a bridge (murder #1)."|1
"One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) laid his life open for all to see, I guess he's fair game to criticize. And that's not hard to do. Here goes. 50 something Glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (I guess 11 films makes him a ""star"") Being gay and forty, I have seen porno and I did not recognize him or his lover."|1
This was honestly the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting was god awful, the story line also was bad. it was however a good idea. if this movie would have had better cinematics, and a lot better actors, i might of had something better to say. edgar allen poe was a great Gothic writer, and this movie just destroyed it. why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies. the only good part was when the killer put the head under the floor with a tape going, that was pretty good.|1
Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter do not have much hope that they can work as a team and become a family member in our lives. They can be as young as 15 and older and still not be able to go to school and get the job or get an apartment or something. They are not likely to be the ones to make it. The real goal is to do it all. The main objective of the modeling world is to do real women and kids in the best way.|0
I fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid . This movie is a complete waste of your time and money. The film has enough drama, intrigue, and characters that it is the worst movie in the world. The director is the best. The film is a total mess. Now that it's out of my hands I'm going to try one more thing, and if anyone knows of a more effective way to do this, I'd love to know about it.|0
"The plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job pretty well. There is a plenty of comic relief, too. Some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first ""chase"" scene, why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models spanning like 50 years, and so the place seems weirdly out of time. Overall, if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well."|1
the first toxie film was dark, gory, and hillarious. This film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz music, no real gore at all, and the worst toxie mask I have ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look NOTHING like them (Claire, Mom Junko), characters names change (Claire or Sara?). It is lacking all the brutal violence, dark humor, and political incorrectness of the first film. If it weren't for nudity, this movie could have been rated PG.|1
I'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is. I'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie, because I'll be here for ages if I do. The storyline is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff (as most of us here are) little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience.|1
Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. The Prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. The victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesn't really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! Not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. However it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by Don Peake.|1
"Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on her front yard in New York City."" ""What did you do to the girl?"" ""Get off my property!"" ""I don't know!"" ""Hey!"" ""Come back to my house!"" ""Please come back!"" ""Come back."" ""What's the matter?"" ""Why don't you come back?"" ""You're crazy."" ""I have something to ask you!"""|0
This move is absolutely, most certainly one of the greatest films of its, or any other, genre. Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development.|1
I watched this movie tonight and I do need to say that it is horrible ! I expected it to be very entertaining ! I don't mean that way as I like to watch it so much ! But it is so sad when you see some of your friends watching it but they do not seem to like the movie . I am looking forward to seeing it :o ) But I'm not a fan of watching the movies anymore and I really hope I don't get too mad . Thank you for sharing and I will be waiting for my reply .|0
I went into this movie determined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I am a big Pacino fan.What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You are in shape Matt.|1
Set in the Philipines, Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit, this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action. But whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs, gun fights and explosions, the quality is just not there. The endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through.The usually impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire-work.|1
I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago , and I can honestly say to is one of the best works in my entire career . And I’m really happy with it . I have many other good ones I’m sure I’ll recommend to friends and strangers . I’m happy with it and I hope you have a happy year and a happy New Year! : ) Thanks a bunch for everything. I will recommend you the most wonderful work of anyone in my life. You know how we all always say we should never write.|0
I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM , so I had the opportunity to see it live at the Hong Kong cinemas and had the chance to watch the movie at the cinema itself. There are so many other places to see it live that I just couldn’t believe what I saw! I think I get it but I don’t know what to say! I was totally in awe of the film so I thought it must be amazing to see it in person and to watch it on TCM , which was so good.|0
"I still count `` Police Squad ! '' as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s . Somewhere , the only place in TV history of `` Police Squad !'' being the only TV show ever which aired on any TV channel was the `` ""Police Squad !'''' show. So that's why we're saying that the two TV series, ''"" ""Police Squad !'' '' have always been seen as '' Police Squad !'' !.'' '' Police Squad ! '''s main reason for being aired on television was for '' Police Squad !''"|0
this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great Disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.I really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. This show has completely changed around. In the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. Its more about her life and dating. Ever since that gay kid (Ben) came along, this show has sucked. The writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. Disney took a turn for the worse.|1
"""The Love Letter"" is a somewhat pleasant, very very low-key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of a sleepy sea-side town's inhabitants.It's not for all audiences. ""The Love Letter"", I feel, benefits from it's simple and quiet tone. Never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint, picturesque, and comfy. However, for these exact same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested.The cast is nice."|1
I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual crap a couple of years ago , and it is now making a comeback. It was based on a video that I had posted back in January of 2011. The video was created as a way to see the world through the eyes of a user. The user had to take the content into an account that the viewer could use to know what the world is actually made of. This user could do this, but the content could only be understood by the user when it was finished.|0
That 's all I can really say about this film . It 's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and Magic, for me. I have to say one of the most disappointing things I've ever read from this film. I was surprised that a lot of things I liked about it did not seem like they were really good. For example, when we were having dinner with the actors (and the director) about how they wanted to be in a movie for the next year, they didn't want to be in the movie.|0
Although I was hoping that I'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim.|1
Yep , it 's me again ! Mr ' I sit through crap so you do n't have to'.What do you mean you don't have to?I mean I think you do have to.There's no better way of saying it than the first time you sit through crap .It is just a matter of time.If I can get you out of your house, I promise I won't need you to keep it that way.I won't need you to keep it that way.If I come back and get it, you'll want to keep it.|0
The plot has something about white hunters captured by a tribe of white women in the African jungle/ plains.Its a turkey and the some. What it really is is wildly mismatched footage from early sound and silent films mixed with badly shot recent(to the release) footage of men on a safari. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, south seas natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikini's, horrible narration and a guy in a loin cloth with make up all over his body (racially insensitive I think so).|1
This is the first porn I 've ever tried to review . It demands a different approach than usual , I would say it seems like it has nothing to do with sex, it's a pretty simple thing to get an accurate idea of what a naked guy is doing in your life . I know you think this is strange but I've only done it once before . I have no experience in porn, so I'm not a huge fan . If I had to recommend this to my friends and their friends, they'd give it 5 stars but it's a small thing.|0
This is an astonishingly bad action film. I'd say its primary flaw is that it's BORING. Arghh! Funky wardrobes, retro chic set design, and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer. Mod Squad's second (major) flaw is its lack of character development--underscored by the actors' lack of talent. I tend to like Claire Danes's work so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is woefully miscast: how could his cotton-mouthed, bumbling acting style possibly fit into an ACTION flick?|1
I thought this movie'd be totally different than just another teen-slasher. Well I was totally wrong. There's a liquid nun coming out of the toilet seat and something really odd. I know that Spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood film. They certainly faked it pretty well though. Why'd they make a movie without any new aspects? This is just plain boring and it'd been done totally without any imagination.I thought that having a nun as the bad guy in the movie'd be something really original.|1
How offensive ! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible . I can imagine those at the cinema would love it and would love it too . In the last couple years the movie industry is doing amazing work in it's first 3 years . This movie has been making a big comeback . It's not as funny as the new one . This movie has made the most money so far with its first 5 years of production . These days you just have to be willing to show your faith and love in a movie .|0
See Three Colors: Blue and Three Colors: White. They are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic film. It can be enjoyed in a single viewing, and indeed, the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing. But, watch it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie, you will see new things with each viewing. With the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind.|1
I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as the best movie of the summer, so it had to wait till Friday to find a decent movie. The movie is supposed to be going on for about ten minutes, and then I’ll have to wait till Sunday to find a decent movie. I don’t know what it should have done, but it was worth it. There were a few scenes that I’d thought were worth it, but they just didn’t happen.|0
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through . It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Mackenzie Mackenzie. It is set in Chicago. It has a story that is both funny and emotional and has a message to all of us. It is about one girl who has just been adopted by two men and she lives with Mackenzie. It is a story of two women who are forced to work together by a man and he tries to change the way things work around her. He is looking at her picture and he realizes that it may be the truth.|0
Nothing about this movie is any good . It 's a formulaic predictable `` romantic comedy '' geared to make your heart and brain ache, and you know the trick it requires. But it doesn't do that at all. That's a good start, I know, just because it's more about a story than a movie but I know it doesn't take into consideration the movie-going element. It just has a lot of tension, and there is tension in it, but I'm not convinced it will work in the movie, or even in the actual film, if I were a movie-going person.|0
Take your video camera, turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like. It is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. To be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie. I like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me. So sorry. I really tried to like it.|1
There is a serious scene in this movie . A scene that lets you know that his film wo n't even exists is happening to a movie. But it just wouldn't make it into a movie, not if it wasn't part of the production. In other words, what a movie can do is make a movie that was meant to take place in a place where there were so many places to have the movie as a story. But it could also be a film that will do it. This is a big thing. The problem isn't that the movie had to have such a scene.|0
this film sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards? I couldn't fathom why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes their entire armoury and disappears again!! Nice work if you can get it. It's sad that the last 1/2 hour has to result in the standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' finale. Arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff. i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film.|1
I rented this movie because I am a huge Dudikoff fan. I figured it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At the 15 minute mark , I was begiing the others to let me rip the DVD out and fling it back to the rental store, but they refused. They swore it had to get better.They were wrong! This movie was lacking everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended that Hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it.|1
This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration. After a session at a recording studio Frank Sinatra leaves and comes upon a group of kids beating up on another because he was Jewish. He lectured them as only an American icon could about the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought for against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer.Both songs from this short subject were recorded and sold big for Columbia records. If You Are But A Dream and the song written for the film, The House I Live In.|1
A woman in love with her husband (he's suicidal) decides to have a baby to save his life. She's been to a fertility clinic - as has the lover she takes - so both know how artificial insemination works; but, instead of using the method thousands of people use every year around the world (the $5 turkey baster), they engage in coitus. We also are to believe that although the immigrant is in love with his fiancée, he doesn't suggest the obvious alternative to intercourse.|1
"""Driving Lessons"" sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on, when Grint's character comes into contact with Evee, (Walters), a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego. Grint betrays his overpowering, and over-Christian mother, (Linney), and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland, to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading, something she claims could be her last, due to an illness.Grint's portrayal of a caged youngster, brainwashed by an overbearing, and even hypocritical mother, is the masterpiece of this film."|1
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow schoolmates alike, in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence.|1
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in Hawaii's state capital. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles.|1
"The reviewer in Variety said this was ""overwritten and overlong"", and I kind of agree with it. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when Cal (Crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of dull' male) and Julianne Moore find a map of the US in kind of an unbelievable place. The story is one of those 1970's ""guy must find meaning in his life"" stories, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his prime playing the role of Cal."|1
Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie . From the misjudged , often incomprehensible script onwards Dr. Wojco is an amazing artist who has always wanted to direct the film but didn’t know that the director was not an expert. Dr. Wojco works as a director at his own art studio and they all seem to have an amazing rapport, especially with the female lead who appears to be much smaller than she seems. It is quite hard to imagine he has had any work of this scale. So, how does a woman become a woman in the film industry?|0
Man, what an awful film. As with many terrible films, the structure of its awfulness lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name. Okay, here's one major problem: Sandra Bullock's character is abducted by Jeff Bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her whereabouts. Come on!|1
"It 's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of four little girls as he and their three children were getting into the house, just in time for Christmas morning."" The tale is actually pretty simple. ""He wanted to have four girls, but she had six. She gave him four more than the rest of us—so he didn't take any pictures. He'd have to take pictures of them as well. And we all knew we weren't that big of a guy, especially when he was a grown-up man and a little girl."|0
The first word i can find to describe this movie is Awful.This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. First of all is the plot a very thin plot (Wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. This makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. Secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. One of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: WHAT THE HELL ARE THE KIDS DOING IN THAT CORN!!!!!!!!!!|1
"You thought after `` Traumschiff Surprise '' that German comedy ca n't get worse ? It can . This comedy was good, especially in the first few days after the show started :P

A few weeks later, as in the early '60s, the show started on the big screen after the first five minutes. This time, it became more serious than the earlier times. And this was in the mid-'70s, when German humor was not as popular, and the show got worse and worse as a whole. The second few weeks were also the most serious times in the show."|0
Intelligent summary, isn't it?If Mad Max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, The Road Warrior. So, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!Such a huge disappointment Beyond Thunderdome was! It's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between Metropolis and The Time Machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction.|1
"In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom, thanks to her sultry beauty and, her highly exploited ""peekaboo"" hairstyle. She starred opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, scoring screen successes in films like ""This Gun For Hire"" and ""I Married A Witch"". She held her own with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in ""So Proudly We Hail"". But changing times and her own failings caught up with her, and by the end of the decade, her heyday was over."|1
"Ahh, nuthin' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...This one stars Jaqueline Lovell(sometimes Sara St. James), the nubile starlet also seen in ""Femalien"", ""The Erotic House of Wax"", and that family favorite ""Nude Bowling Party"". She is now a fixture in Surrender Cinema's line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. ""Head of the Family"" actually tries to be a real moovie. A con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp's husband off-ed."|1
I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? It really is great, very funny. I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie, at home and school. One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. But he didn't, so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours, or he would have to go to Summer School. Yep, he wrote it in 2:45.|1
Well the previews looked funny and I usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know. Here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic.|1
The storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile . Jolie 's acting is pretty flat and he just has to find the right moment to give it a shot, which seems like an awful way to end a story. I'd say it's a hell of a lot of plot, and it's all in the end, but you'll have to wait and see, and I'd say a lot of different endings, and I don't know the details, and I'd probably end the story right before you.|0
I cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it. I read a few comments and I see that only proud and patriotic Frenchmen seem to like it, that's all I can say...Boring Long Sometimes even stupid...p.s. 7.4 out of 10, the viewers must be going crazyI cant go for long describing this tittle, simply because I do not feel strong about it.

We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age , with the Royal Navy and Air India being at one with the British at the other . The English are also at the top in terms of aircraft type and the Royal Navy and Air India in terms of flying capability , but the fact that they have never been involved in combat is surprising . The Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines are the first nations to be involved in combat . In other words they have never been involved in a war .|0
"I can see what this film was intending to do. Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal. The ""reality crime"" aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate. In fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way. Notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman, the scene of the detectives going through the garbage, and the father tying flies. On occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog. Instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book."|1
Sometimes there 's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe . This is one of those times where you have to watch for a long while, but after you finally have a really good one, you have to keep on going . And you have to watch this one again for another couple of weeks to see all of it and to get a feeling of just what the hell was up there . You know what the most important thing you can do is . . and you can get it all right.|0
I was sorely disappointed in this movie . Twice I was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so big. I remember watching it on VHS. So, I think it's a shame because I loved it! I hope I didn't do this. I had a huge heart break. I had to get up. I still don't understand why. It was the first time I really understood. The way I was being thrown off that TV was so big. I still want to say that I didn't even realize how big the movie was before I wrote it.|0
This is a tough film to review , since several factors need to be taken into account . Let 's take a step back , but first we are to make some assumptions on what is happening in the movie , and then we go to the heart of it for a second . The way in which we make these assumptions and then the rest is just what we have in our hands to make it right. The first assumption we make about it is that the movie is going to be made in the UK.

I looked forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good film about Jefferson . This film has some interesting characters that I have not watched before, but there is a good portion of it in that film which is why I am making this post. I look forward to watching the film as it has a strong story. As I said, I am watching it this weekend so I will hopefully have plenty of time to look at it from a new perspective. After all I am enjoying the story, the film and the characters well I will enjoy watching it again in the next weekend.|0
Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry , like the first time I saw this movie . Not sure why I want this movie in the first place . My parents didn't like it at all and they don't want any sequels . The first movie for this one I don't know . This movie is really not for the movies and this movie will be a long one , in order to save time , I think . Also this is actually a very short movie . I don't know if I could tell the movie the best way , but it's a very interesting movie .|0
I saw this film at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace cinemas, and was totally switched onto it in the opening five minutes. Thanks goodness for a film that ignores all the rubbish we often see in Australian films that seem to revolve around a)race b)gender and c) class, in favour of er...dare I say....jolly good cinema. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap called Alex Frayne introduced his film, made with a bunch of his mates near the town he spent much of his childhood.|1
What a trip down memory lane.Do not look for great acting , believable plot lines , or anything resembling a great deal on the part of the cast. I have no clue how these are related to the series, but I can give you some idea of what they’re all looking for. I would love to see you guys in person tonight so get in touch with us via our twitter feed (we are all very excited to see what you have up there!) and if you are interested I would love to hear more about the cast and anything that you have in the works.|0
My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking either Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons though.This is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet.Yancy Butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. She is not the best of actresses, in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film.|1
`The Last Frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army, particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.'|1
"Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the ""earlies"" (often black and white and inventive), the ""naughties"" (late 1960s/early 1970s often involving Soledad Miranda), the ""nudies"" (of various periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive)and ""the rest"".This is part of the ""rest"". It is not really a cannibal movie at all. It is certainly no gorefest. The few women in the picture dont even lose their loin cloths and there is little full frontal stuff at all."|1
The TV announcer who introduced this late one Saturday night said it should have won Oscars. Quite a statement for a film I'd never heard of...though why I should have taken any notice of a TV announcer, I don't know. In the event, said announcer was talking tripe.It's a dreary, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I couldn't get on with Hoskins' awful Burr-ming-gum accent. Can't see any advantage in it being set in the Midland's anyway. Unresolved threads abound...and I wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense.|1
It 's complete nonsense . I 've studied Nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the `` parallels are all in the right way!`` The same has been said by the New Testament of the Bible . The same has been said by Christ. But that is a lie! So you see, I 'm really not sure this has ever been said by an educated man in his lifetime, or by anyone else who has read the Bible or the Christian Scriptures. There are many, many other things that a human being who has just read the bible, has not said to them.|0
i 'm not going to ramble on about it but i 'm just going to make it brief . basically the same thing happened to me but it wasn't so bad . so i don't want to go through a lot of it to try and prove it but i 'm just going to make it brief . so please let me know if you got any ideas of how to use this as a lesson . I hope i can help you on your way . Thanks for your time , I will get back on the bike soon . I have not ridden that long but have ridden that many times .|0
This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem.|1
"I wo n't waste your time by describing the plot for this , the other reviewer already did this quite well. ------
kleib
I'm sorry about that. It was my fault for not trying. It was also a mistake
when I thought I'd already made up the argument that there were problems. I do think it was my fault. I think the only reason I can find to make the
possible was to get the idea off my chest. The reason I didn't make the
possible would have been that I needed to make the argument in some other way."|0
**** MILD SPOILERS _ BUT YOU PROBABLY KNOW THE PLOT ****Woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind . Oh did I mention the rape victim was mute ? That`s the problem with MS 45 , Thana the rape victim decides she`s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this ? Surely the whole film would have better if we had Thana give a voice over as to why she`s bumping off any man she comes across ?|1
"Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a ""crypto-zoologist"" (fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare - read: nonexistent - animals) and his crew of hunters manage to trap a Chupacabra, a big, scaly, elusive fast-moving beast. To get it to the mainland, they smuggle it on a Grecian cruise ship and some idiots open up the crate containing it despite being told specifically not to. I guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either."|1
No,no,no. That is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film. Anthony Perkins is the one and ONLY Norman Bates,as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This just seems like a colorized version of Psycho,with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is dull as ill Norman,and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis seems too much the cowboy compared to the original. Please folks,do yourself some justice. Don't bother with this.|1
I 've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him . I hope he 'll be able to tell us what he meant by that. There is a great opportunity for you to tell the story of your life and to talk about your experience. You should come back and ask questions in the future and I think you'll be a good audience for your book. I think it's very fitting for you. If you do decide to take an interest in your life then I hope you'll like it then.|0
The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable . It was just one of those scenes that felt so very special. . I had to sit down for a quick look at the script. I got a look at the pictures. They were of a scene from the original movie. The picture is a couple of weeks old from a new version of the film. It's the first time I've watched an episode of The Simpsons, but I've never seen it in real life, so this is the first time a Simpsons movie has been shot in real life.|0
What a cast ... and what a waste of it . Seriously , when a movie has Gabriel Byrne , we all know that he's the perfect person for the job. It's so obvious that it was all up to him. It's just that he was really good as a casting person. He's a great actor, and as a person you can really do anything to have a great actor come to the role. I've been known to sit with people and think about them and get them to do this or this or that and think about them in such a different way.|0
My two daughters ( ages 11 and 13 ) and I were lucky enough to see a screening of this film in the theater one night. It was a bit of a surprise considering that it was a documentary and the film had to be shot in the theater, otherwise the screening would have ended before it even got the film. I’m not sure this film is a great film but I think it would be interesting to see it in the cinema or even at home as it would certainly help with the movie itself. I’d also really like to see what they’ve seen so far.|0
"A girl named Isobel becomes possessed by a demon. The local priest (who formerly dated Isobel's sister) must try to save her, but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter.This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, the writer of ""House"" and the writer/director of ""House II"". I loved the first film and liked the second one even better, so you would think this would be a winner. Alas, this one looks like it was thrown together by first-year film students."|1
"I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa has become the most civilised region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been designated ""Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)."""|1
The Outsiders is undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well defined characters, tight scripts, varied and interesting locales, great guest stars and a filmic ambiance all combined to make this series a special one.Sadly, Andrew Keir has passed on & Sascha Hehn from Germany does not appear (unfortunately) to have enjoyed small screen success in his native country. The ABC has repeated the series many times yet a DVD release is yet to happen.The series is one which is timeless. It is as likely to strike a resonant chord with viewers today as it did in its own day.|1
I watched this movie with my mother . She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot . I have to believe that if I didn't like this movie I might as well stick with the same movie in my heart . . . . . If you ever want to put it all in your mouth . . . . I would do it again in my memory . . . . But it's not the same, and no, it is not a movie, but a song . . . . What do you know about songwriting? . . . .|0
This movie was fabulous. It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film. The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that. I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part).|1
"""Tumbling Doll of Flesh"" by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse,torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions.Typically twisted Japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore.There is no plot to speak of,just plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of blood.The special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of Japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail.The tongue cutting scene really made me squirm.Her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines."|1
It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bounty hunter of souls. It should be a fairly straightforward hunter/hunted kind of story, but the director and/or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting. Things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with flowing CG colors.|1
"I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case . Judge and Ms. F.

You will probably have to look over the whole case for a bit, just to see who is responsible for all of this . . . And you'll have to look at the photos that Judge and Ms. F took of that picture. I know it's not a bad picture, but the only way to get a picture of Judge and Ms. F in this case is that they took some photos of Judge. And I think you could look around them and see what was on those pictures ."|0
Help ! Once again , Paul Schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull , pedantic storytelling . I rearranged his head so that it was on a pedestal on the hill , like I told you earlier . Now that we've gotten on to our next task we'll finally see that Paul's head is not on a pedestal , it's on him . It's on him and it is on him . I think that Paul is in charge of the plot . That's because he knows how to do . . he's a writer . .|0
"I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the ""dumb American"" . . . well, not perfectly.I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon."|1
I found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic . It tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against their parents. I am trying to understand how to make that movie and understand the real world and what people need to do to achieve their goals. But I have some problems with it. First of all, I believe you have to know that there is no real way to create the best film, movie, story or story of your life in the real world. This means that if you are going to make movies, stories or movies based on your experiences with kids and parents.|0
"There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it. I have no idea how the screenplay for this one made it past the shredder. It's horrible. Completely unwatchable. I hung in there for 45 minutes (about half the running time) and just couldn't stand it anymore. I was an Elijah Wood fan in the '90s (see ""The War"") and I learned to enjoy Mandy Moore's shifts from bubbly to serious this year (see ""Chasing Liberty"" which is surprisingly entertaining). I've seen bits of ""Run Lola Run."""|1
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I've seen a duff film. I guess I'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. So I check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties.|1
I 'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview ( yes , SOS ... ) which will, I think, send a couple of crew members in to help out. And if you take into account that you're not a submarine, you might want to look at some of the other suggestions I've been getting, such as taking advantage of the U-B and U-BOS. That's pretty good. But the point is that I've always seen the concept of 'U-S-S-E' more as an option than a real-world idea.|0
I decided to watch this movie because I 'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie . I 'm a total idiot. I 'm not saying I wasn't a total idiot and I just don't care. I just wanted to get the hell out of bed and get back to my life. (I wasn 't even sure why I had to go to sleep. I was just not sure if I wanted to.) There 'd be a moment like that when I decided to go to bed and wake up the next morning.|0
It's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance(Anderson's eyes are perceivably larger, lips thicker, nose larger and turned up at the end....etc), Anderson's unable to speak Russian was a ridiculous tell......That's why I detest Anna Anderson and her confederates so much. Not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60+ years with such a blatantly untenable scheme.Yet to some extent I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days.|1
I wo n't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating , plenty of other people have pointed it out , so I think it has to be good enough , but you should also take a look at the review system . In order for a bad review to appear, the reviewer must know what kind of rating is required for a review, and this can be done easily by looking at their own comments. Now, the reason to keep in mind is that you'll want to check in on the review queue for a better rating if the reviewer is looking for a lower.|0
Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli. This movie is great because it was a lot more real and funnier than fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van halen which went on to become songs on ou812 and unlawful carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the great stoner film heroes with cheech and chong. Fast times was more depressing than funny. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad jobs, and failing school. Someone must hate the eighties to like ridgemont more than the wild life.|1
Low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story. This movie is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The alluring Tania Frankenstein(Sara Bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein(Joseph Cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. This is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. Supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux.|1
For an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10 , but in general it's a great start. I'm enjoying it and can't recommend it to all of my readers who aren't a big film fan. I think I like it a lot. I'm glad you liked it, but for some reason it's a little bit better. You are probably not doing this right, but if it's not, it's probably worth the price of admission if it's your first time buying. And I'm glad that you loved it!|0
"I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that are n't stories , but the way he tried to convince me to give them away. I would be interested in seeing if that would be possible and if they had anything in common I would be curious to find out for myself. A:

You have to explain what you are doing. If there's something about how you're creating the stories that I'm trying to explain (I don't believe you're making them a part of this) it should be described in some way."|0
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville, FL, murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.About half the footage is of the trial; it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses, and visiting key locations. This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition, and placed in logical order.|1

"When King Kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake, I was breathless. I don't know how many times I went back to see that movies hoping to see more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress then (She became one), but she was so hot! I went to see ""Sweet Dreams"" when it came out because, by that time, Ms. Lange had become a great actress. It looked like a wonderful story. And she's always exciting to see.I never walked out of a movie faster."|1
This movie took me by surprise . I first saw it more than 10 years ago , and it stays the way it is . I have never seen the movie but it is amazing . My husband and my two daughters are watching it and they are laughing at what they have watched. . If you are not already a fan , you have probably heard about it . The movie was a success . We were lucky to get a few of their friends who were going on to the next movie . They got a few more friends to keep me entertained .|0
I'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when I saw this movie in a $5 bin I figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection. While I never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing.The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her, he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea.|1
To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. That is well written, and has a fantastic cast. It's not loaded with blood and guts. And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Braugher), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzda), and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode. Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO. Is this still a good story YES.|1
"First off, I never got into Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun intended) since it was never ""big"" here in the US as it is everywhere else.That said, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the 2nd season, that this is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen.Now, I watch a lot of Sci-Fi shows from all over and this show stands out.The first season was tops to begin with, with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought he was terrific."|1
Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote . I 've seen them, but to be honest, there are some similarities in them. But I've not seen them for a while now. I'm not sure about the similarities, I've seen them in theaters. I have never seen a movie made in any of these films before. There are three films I've seen in a year, and three films that were made in the U.S. before. But they were not theatrical releases. In fact, I never saw the two films I've seen.|0
I remember the events of this movie , the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968 , in the summer of 1963 , when the ship's crew was told that they couldn't take off at night , the next day . I remember the same story . The ship was on a hot summer day in 1964 when the crew tried to go ashore, but it was impossible due to the temperature . The next morning the ship went down in a fog, the fog kept rising, and suddenly the sea seemed to be breaking . It was like a volcano that had erupted, it was boiling .|0
Well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it!,so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm? !,it is teenager movie i agree..,so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good..,so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.Anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''.|1
"I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the first one, so I didn’t know where to start looking. Here’s my full review…

You see, there’s something about the actors in this film that I really like. I can see myself saying, “Oh well, this is great. The first one was great.” Which is an odd thing for me because I thought I was going to write a movie in which I was doing nothing."|0
Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let 's face it , sometimes these types of movies are more fun and memorable to watch when they're being shown on television and in films. So for example this would be an excellent movie if I were to take the movie with me every Friday. That's why you should always watch this movie at home or on the go and you'll see it on TV for a few minutes of enjoyment. But if I have a hard time getting up the courage to watch the movie I will probably take the movie that week to see.|0
After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh OK I'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the 'Nightbeast' emerges, OK so I lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people.|1
Doctor Who is amazing. It is everyones 'cup of tea'. It must be. The boys will like the monsters and the action and adventure and the girls will like the emotion and feelings that go around. Billie Piper was extraordinary as Rose Tyler. She was so emotional and made Rose so real.David Tennant is also so witty and funny and it is so enjoyable to watch.But now Billie has left and Rose is stuck on a parallel universe with her on-off boyfriend Mickey and her mother and father (he died when Rose was a baby but this Pete Tyler is from the Parallel universe).|1
Wayne Wang 's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than `` Slums. But when I look at it, it is just the opposite. It looks like it is a story about a friend, and when it comes to showing the world, there are lots of things going on, and the thing that seems to make a film about the best friends you will ever see is the reality. But the truth is I am a very hard-boiled. ... I have not seen a single movie in this genre, if any, so I don't know.|0
"This is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. There's also beetle banging. As Violet would have put it: ""This (plastic peen) goes up your butt""."|1
Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas, the roistering, free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II, he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries.|1
Everything about this movie was bad , the acting was bad and the plot was bad . And were is not a very good movie. You have to watch the movies to know that it is not a bad movie. Why not have fun with this movie? What does not have fun about it are the characters that are the same as the characters of your movie and you want to play it as a normal person. The characters are the same as the characters of your movie , and are different from one movie to the next in a way.|0
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I did n't feel like watching tripe like this, so I got to see it. So it is the first time that I was able to spend a lot of time staring at it. Then I got to know how it works, so I don't remember exactly what it looks like at the time. On one of the windows, it's kind of weird; the light is so bright that I see it right before I get to see how it looks out there.|0
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:Why are there so many songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, And rainbows have nothing to hide. So we've been told and some choose to believe it I know they're wrong, wait and see.|1
"Night hunter is a sold B style action movie. Get a life and grow up people. Don ""the Dragon"" Wilson is a kick boxer, (hall of fame) and not an actor. If your looking for an Oscar, it's not here brother. Looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget, this is it.The plot line may have been a little thin, but what B movie isn't. I understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure. Get real people, judging every movie like it is an Oscar contender, just silly."|1
Charles Bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen . But this movie lacks everything that the audience loves it for. The first two minutes are a blur, but they show the full cast as it moves through the room. There is a main story and a few glimpses into the characters. Then there are the second and third moments. They also show that the characters are very different from any of the previous films. You have the original characters, who were originally drawn by one of the actors. They are not much bigger than the main characters.|0
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne, the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage), a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret, he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan, yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks.|1
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** There's not much that can be said about this early-talkie era flick. (I'm hesitant to call ""Cimarron"" a ""film"", because I feel that the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it...mainly speaks against it.Take, for example, the overuse of portraying Indians as bad folk. In one scene, the little boy of the flick's lead character--an overbearing and over-ambitious family man who wants to set up a newspaper business-- is playing just outside of his father's office."|1
This isn't exactly a complicated story. It's not a mystery, or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. Claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films, however this isn't one of them. Those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog, or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. With Goya's Ghosts this doesn't apply.|1
"This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level; which is why it failed to build a decent story around them. I couldn't follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why I should care.This movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all. It's basically about a girl being in love with her sister, and her sister being in love with the idea of ""men""."|1
"I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America. I have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled ""Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op."|1
The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. Story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. It is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. Much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. Still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels.|1
"MGM hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throwing a big party for everybody in Hollywood. No major stars show up--we get the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I didn't recognize anyone else--they were probably unknowns (for good reason). The movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography. The only things that save this from being a total disaster are Laurel & Hardy's ""battle"" with Lupe Velez and a wonderful color Disney cartoon called ""The Hot Chocolate Soldier"". It's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost."|1
Aside from the fact that this movie was filmed mostly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful town where my mother once rented a small storefront and I spent many a pleasant summer as a child, it is fun and cute little film. I must admit that I had no desire to actually see this movie even though I have a weakspot for romantic comedies (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not appealing, the cast did not look that interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be about.|1

I've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it. But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast the plot hardly matters. An astronaut crash lands and is believed dead. His body later reanimates, but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien life-form. But how did they get there? And where's the alien that implanted the strange creatures in Maj. John Corcoran's body? IMDb lists the runtime for Night of the Blood Beast at 62 minutes. Is that right? 62 minutes?|1
"There is a lot to like in this film, despite its humble trappings of a preachy PC tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim. The movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes. (I, for one, was sure it was the teacher. In fact, that would have been more probable plot-wise because the idea of the best-friend's boy-friend kind of came out of nowhere. I guess the point of that is that ""rape is omnipresent. You never know who it is going to be"".)"|1
Talk about creepy. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. I don't so I thought, to be frank, this episode was appalling. Thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in Season 3, and the only Charles Grant Craig episode, so you don't get much of this sort of thing in Season 3. So, overall verdict? Just read the summary at the top.|1
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. Having read the comments on this title, I must agree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and, to me, it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic, flag-waving American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series.|1
"Fun , entertaining movie about WWII German spy ( Julie Andrews ! ) falling in love with American pilot ( George Carlin , the most famous hero of the war ) is a hilarious comic book that you get to read for free, which you can print at any time! Here is the original comic strip:

’The Great War’

This comic is about a German Air Force soldier who goes by the name of The Great War. He is a German pilot, and his mission to save Germany is to find an enemy that may be hiding from the Allied powers."|0
The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. I've got no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed but Bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft, comical, men. The film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome.The acting's all good and the direction very solid. The locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?|1
Most of other reactions by subscribers to this service were very apt, although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me. Rather than ambiguous, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. One can see it as anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes, and the folly of pretended grandeur, as how wonderful the cavalry men looked as they prepared for the great charge at Eylau, contrasted with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion, when we see the bloody uniforms, the boyish dead, etc--but chiefly, I see the film as about a moral man in an immoral society.|1
This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The acting was just soooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice over was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as frat boy Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. 'Ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue.|1
Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet? I can see that a lot of people have inquired but I can't tell if any of them have been successful. It's hard to believe that a series this good cannot be viewed by people today, especially one based on real issues faced by real people during what were both tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? As an aside I agree with all the comments other writers have made about this series on this web site.|1
This is almost Ed Wood territory . Yeah , that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross sectional of a large-scale battle going on in our universe . We are going to have to wait until we get there and we’re actually gonna see what happens! It’s called a “crowd control” . We’re a big part of that, though. It seems that some guys have a habit of doing that on their planes . So what’s to keep them from taking off and coming down?|0
"There is something that one of the characters (the aging film director who pretends to be dead) says which may summarize all the film: ""In Italy it's the dead who rule"". True! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and jaded men. And Bellocchio's cryptic portrait of the country, pivoted on the apparently senseless story of a director who has to film marriage parties to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what is not working here. But foreigners may miss the point, as it's not clearly expressed."|1
OK so this is about 30 minutes of gore with no story whatsoever. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, not even any real characters. You see three people in the entire movie (that are alive) and two are just there for very little reason. The main guy has no emotion and just mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. That is the entire movie. I love to see very gory movies, especially since in America real gore just isn't very common in modern movies. So yeah the gore effects were pretty cool. But it just isn't really disturbing.|1
This movie was terrible. You couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and I literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. Worse than all Dean Cain films combined. To start, the acting was terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent.|1
I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:1.Let's make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It'll sell... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. I know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. That hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.Now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window.|1
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have had to rush to the bathroom and vomit til dawn. A sick film that was NOT funny and was NOT worth the money, any money at all. If anybody ever wants to see this movie don't! Your kids will never forgive you and will claim sickness for a week. So if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind please don't see this movie. I beg of you, DON'T!|1

Given the acting roles he played in the 1940s (Casper Gutman, Signior Ferrari, Mr. Peters, Jerome K. Arbutny, Ex-Superintendent Grodman, Count Fosco, Titus Semple) it surprises many of his fans to learn that originally Sidney Greenstreet made a name for himself in comedies in the West End and Broadway. He was usually such a total villain, or serious actor to the public that his comic talents were ignored. In fact he actually did make four comedy appearances (one a spoof of his villainous portrayals with his villainy partner Peter Lorre in a cameo appearance).|1
Watching this odd little adventure movie, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but it has to be said that despite it's low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it's getting. Like many Italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful American film, the one in question this time being the critically panned Island of Dr Moreau.|1
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals, it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty leaps out of the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas, and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of class. The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies, Cover Girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.|1
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance . i went from suspended disbelief on the screen to a sense of humor that was amazing, I really enjoyed it, so i don't want to see what I did have in store for me on the day, but thank God I found the way to see it for myself . so great job! and i hope it goes well on release , will watch it when it is a week old and enjoy! I think this was really fun and a great movie.|0
Got this the other day from the Creators on DVD . I saw this advertised in a free magazine whilst watching the movie I have been watching for a while and I thought about it and tried it but didn't want to give it to anyone. There are many good reviews on the internet about these videos but not many people have any idea of what they are actually doing. I really don't like the title of the video because it implies the content is just that, a series of movies that are more or less the same as the main character.|0
Poor Bela Lugosi . Just another day at work . A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war in Afghanistan . Just a small group of saboteurs in the jungle . Their goal is a massacre and bloodshed . Not for nothing is the U.S. Navy's ability to protect its own citizens . It's a war the U.S. Navy has no control over, and we don't want it to be . We don't need to have any more weapons. The U.S. Navy has no role in its war. We can't fight it because the U.S. Navy can't fight in it.|0
I've seen a few bad action movies in my days, but this one's just plain awful. I feel it's a waste of time to even write this but I'll make it short. Why this movie suck? here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateurly directed and cut. 2. Bad bad bad acting of the whole cast. 3. Silly dialogs and too many clichés. 4. Too many plot holes, a lot of scenes don't add up. 5. Bad photographing (and a lot of continuity issues). 6.|1
This is the worst of the toxie series by far. The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. The major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. Like there's a different girl friend of toxie's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick. Why is this film made like a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all. There's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop.|1

'Blade ' would be an extremely above-average comic-book , vampire-hunter action/horror if it were n't for two minor flaws . . . I don't think this is the place to go from there . . . I think it would be good for it to get a little more action , horror-tales in there . . . because that's just what you might expect to find, and this might be the best way to go . . .

If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. It is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.Not quite ten years after the film, I knew Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work.|1
"I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny, and he asked where the video would go. I told him, ""There's not a ton of video on it yet, so it's all in one hour."" And I said, ""Well, I'll be there by then."" I was like, ""What's up?"" I said, ""I think I'll call the police and then I can tell them where to look for the video."""|0
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good, nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but I think that is totally missing the point. If your expecting fast cars, T&A or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this, you'll be disappointed and dumbfounded.This movie was thoroughly enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think.|1
Can't say this wasn't made well. At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes. And there isn't the slightest indication he didn't get exactly what he wanted. But this is an oddly non-Hispanic film in the same way West Side Story was many years ago. Both the leads, a brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their parts. The setting, a sort of underground car repair district in Queens, is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself.|1
"I'll give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be a one.I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first ""Road"" picture I've seen. I was expecting waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of the Road movies. If that's true I needn't bother to see the others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie.I didn't like the movie."|1
This is a movie from Toilet Pictures . If the name of the production company is any indication how stinky it sounds then you are in for a real treat! A couple of years back I had the idea for a feature film called “Eureka” in which the movie was directed by A.J. Haider. Haider would do the same thing, but be a little late. I did not have time to get into a few things, but I’ll save this for other movies if they come up for release in the near future, and I thought it had great potential as well.|0
"In this approximately 34-second Thomas Edison-produced short, we see Annabelle Moore performing the Loie Fuller-choreographed ""Serpentine Dance"" in two different fantastical, flowing robes.Moore was one of the bigger stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in a number of Edison Company shorts, including this one, which was among the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894.Loie Fuller had actually patented the Serpentine Dance, which Moore performs here in robes (as well as entire frames) that are frequently hand tinted in the film, presaging one of the more common symbolic devices of the silent era."|1

'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago, but was unable to finish it. I'll review this film version solely on its own merits, as I don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel.The film's opening credits are printed in an Old English typeface that suggests the mediaeval period, and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting.|1
"It starts a little slow but give it a chance. In the spirit of the ""Wackiest Ship in the Arm"" and the ""Pink Sub"" this movie is about a not so orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as a LT that takes himself way too seriously which results in a failed mutiny attempt and ""pirate"" crew makes him walk the plank. In contrast Kelsey Grammar(similar to Cary Grant)does not take anything to serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot."|1
"This film is much the same as Cannibal Holocaust. If it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of 'shock' (""Ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we've added real death to our films"") these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf - I'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies. But as it stands, it's another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype. To sum up, a crusty gore flick with limited appeal."|1
"Another lame attempt to make a movie ""gritty"" and ""thought provoking""- whatever the hell that means. They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - ""Television killed football."" Yeah whatever. This is another movie that showcases Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs? He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons."|1
"""Chupacabra Terror"" is saved from a '1"" by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as the heroine. She is a delight to watch, from the front, back and side. Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing like a low-budget, shipboard version of THE RELIC. John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported. And the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit. He does commit about 100 senseless, gory killings, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome."|1
"Movies aren't always suppose to be about deep, provolking thoughts. Sometimes they're simply meant to be escapes from reality. Out To Sea fits the bill perfectly. A light hearted ""golden years"" romantic comedy, Out To Sea may not be big budget, you might be able to easily tell when they were acting in front of a green screen, but it's still very much a movie worth watching. A sweet movie that needs to be given a break. This is just good, light hearted fun. It's not meant to be a deep movie."|1

"This film gives new meaning to the term ""uneven"", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.The plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. She also may be seducing their sons.It is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him."|1
I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was put on by the San Francisco Opera and starred George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early '80s Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won the Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show.|1
"The prior comments are way to generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as ""beyond belief!"" ""no words can express how I feel about this"" ""This movie will move you"" As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie."|1
"This has to rate as one of the cheesiest of TV shows in a long time.Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did the part justice and certainly looked the part. But nowadays, it strikes me that the Nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye, from the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around.His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his ""Penguin"" days from Batman."|1
"`` Valley Girl '' launched Nicolas Cage 's career and was an 80 's version of `` Romeo and Juliet,'' which appeared in the 1966 film ""Mesmerize"" as the main character, and eventually appeared in ""The Other Side of Mr. and Mrs. Hines"", a sequel to ""The Other Side of Mr. and Mrs. Hines"". The story was filmed in London, although in the 1970's Nicolas Cage released ""The Phantom of the Opera"" as well. In 1973 Nicolas Cage was a major-bigger star in a number of major British television series."|0
This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny , entertaining , sweet and memorable. I have always loved watching comedy movies and I have always felt it has been a great time for my family. I had to watch it today because this movie makes the point that it is a family comedy, but I think I had to watch it because I was watching this movie with my mother. She did a good job of being funny while doing this, but I had to watch this movie to see that it was hilarious.|0

When I was five years old , it was my favorite television show . I remembered it was on channel 13 and they made me watch it , I watched it for hours , and watched it to death , but still watched it . . . It's funny how that happens in our family .

ExCUSE me, but my tongue was TOO in my cheek when we filmed this piece o' poop. As the evil sister with hair that Mommy Dearest would envy, I did my very best to channel Tim Curry in Rocky Horror. I'm sad that this did not come across... Ah well, a friend compared it to a 'rock bottom budget SHOWGIRLS' with a white hot spoon.' I'll have to be content with that. What amazes me is no one mentioned the endless (and dull) wet T-shirt contest. It is seriously the longest wet T-shirt contest in cinema history.|1
Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in the very northern part of Norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of Norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.The most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. The people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings.|1
This is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen . And believe me , I have seen a few better movies of the same kind. If this movie were to be a horror film I wouldn't be looking at it. It's almost impossible to see the movie if you are watching a bad movie of the same kind. So, why would you do it? Just to say the movie is a horrible movie. It's actually not a movie. It is a TV show. It has no characters. But, it has the same theme.|0
I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively. Anger surged in me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombard. And by living in the country right now with my parents, who's been living in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we're much better off now, and would have been better if the American didn't bring war here. Watching the movie, I learned more of the different kinds of wars that the America planned in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused.The series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people.|1
This movie was everything but boring . It deals with reality . To the people who think this movie was boring, we need to know who the actual creators of it is. In this movie, they all have a story to tell about their past. So it’s interesting to see how a guy that’s already dead can come up with a better one. A guy with a similar past is the perfect example of what you want to be when you see the trailer. The guy that gets killed is pretty much the best one in the world!|0
Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from South America where he has been investigating Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans.|1
"Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC :"" It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner "" "" And after GLC what next for Bronson ? "" "" We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same "" This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO ."|1
This movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they are interesting. Straight from the coke-filled gutters of New York's arty farty incestuous drama scene.How so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated 'actor guild' or maybe they have never seen a decent movie?Get out, put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job.|1
If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience, than this awful motion picture (if you may consider to call it that) is for you. A film worse than the postman,sizzle Beach U.S.A, Batman and Robin, Kazaam,fair game...well you get my point.This film directed by French television sensation Patrick Sebastien (Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 25) can truly be considered the worst film ever made. I do hope that Troma or someone in America would distribute it, so that the u.s.a can experience the French stench at it's worth.|1
"This is a film by Oshima , the director of the notorious `` In The Realm Of The Senses '' movie, based on the popular sci-fi film of the same name. It is directed by Akira Kurosawa as an actor. The film is composed by Shogo Kaneko who plays Oshima. In the same book, Oshima is mentioned as a villain of the film. Contents

Title

The title is a tribute to Kurosawa who won the title of a famous film by Toyoko, in which he acted a role in the film. It is written by Motoshita Ishiguro."|0
Unreal !!!!!!!!. After reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers ,I was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38 , all rated this film a 10. Upon comparison with other great films, these reviewers felt that the Quick and the Undead is a better film than,The 6th Sense(8.2), Saving Private Ryan(8.4), Lord of the Rings( 8.7),Godfather(9.5), Gladiator(8.1) and Dawn of the Dead ( 7.8) to name a few.|1
"Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I have n't seen or from her early movie career is a chance you do, right?"" she asks. ""Would you give me a minute?"" He shakes his head, as if to confirm this. ""What would your day do for a film you're not familiar with? It would be a great chance to get to know our daughter, and to get a glimpse of what it's like to live in this world. You would have a better chance to make friends with her."""|0
This film did not excite me . While on vacation in Turkey I noticed that it was playing at the end of the line. I knew I had it on my mind but it didn’t seem to be coming to play. I wondered if I’d have something else to show. I wanted to know that. I looked down and saw an image of a dog with what appeared to be a beagle. A dog? I didn’t understand the meaning of that but I knew it was a cat. My curiosity had started a few hours earlier but I never had the time to find out.|0
I know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. The average Joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. The entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. This is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. However, unless you really love this sort of art or are a Canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish.|1
"What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of what talent there was.Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout. Jon Lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or can Kari Wuhrer barely act in this one.The story was pretty non-existent and really disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired. Like the surf ""dudes"" giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about that you NEVER saw them surf once!!"|1
When all we have anymore is pretty much reality TV shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than I know Hollywood has run out of original ideas. I can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves? I would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before.|1
In Michele Soavi's confusing art-house zombie film, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead don't stay buried for long. Aided by his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the cemetery's zombie problem by either shooting the undead in the head or splitting their skulls with a spade.However, soon after falling for the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his recently interred, Francesco finds himself busier than ever beforeHaving garnered some particularly favourable comments from some of IMDb's more respected horror officianados, I decided to see what the fuss was all about.|1
I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint, and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are, which is basically what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward.|1
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The acting was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madigan played the part of a guilt ridden mother who is tired, yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter's condition. Yet, in the process, she has neglected her older sister, who is more interested in playing with her savant-syndrome sibling and living in a world of escapism.The men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles.|1
The appeal of this film has to be the artsy Euro style, because there's absolutely no substance. A bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere... but it never gets there.It's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary, because this film is such a totally empty experience. There's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. These elements undermine each other. Just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex.|1
I've always enjoyed Frank Sinatra's music, and just recently I wrote a term paper about his life story. I've been fascinated by the life and legend of Ol' Blue Eyes. However, I've never seen any of his movies. So I wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing. Well...it was! I was blown away by his performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict Frankie Machine, who's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band.|1
* SPOILERS INCLUDED * Alfred Hitchcock 's brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch 's novel was an amazing film. This week we bring you two films from the past five years where you’ll also see what we thought we knew about the genre as we made our way on to the screen. The last two are the most influential films of the past couple of years so that’s a great summary of the films we’ve seen here from the beginning of the last few years and we have some more notes to share.|0
"Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do! I was appalled. Do NOT take kids to see this movie. The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they'll be bored and disappointed. Certainly *we all* have read Theo's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations...but this is pure trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his ""thumbs up"" at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic.What a pity. Spend your money on the book. If you own a copy, then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program."|1
I can see what this film was intending to do . Unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal . The first film from the production team is the first in a series of interviews . It’s about a boy with a special gift for her father, and her sister. It starts off with an interview with an aspiring actress. She takes a deep dive into some of the themes and scenes in the film and has to decide on where she wants to go. Then she takes a shot at the story of the family.|0
"Well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for Pre WWII Italy. But what happened here? Great actors...Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ...if you can't get memorable performances out of this `A List' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. I rented this on DVD after having liked ""Angels & Insects"" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. Yipes! I can hardly believe how dull this thing was."|1
I ca n't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on IMDb . Of course , you are not to blame for it if you did not read the article . It is just that it does not provide an easy way to find out how it has gone wrong . This is why there is a lot of work going on and I hope they will get the answer to the problem . If you look closely at what it says, then you can see why this is true . After reading this article, I have to go back a few weeks and look at the content .|0
"For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie , another payday in L.A. For one lucky guy in L.A. For one lucky guy, the movie would have been wonderful! If you don’t know anything about L.A. for a movie, you may be asking for the answer:

How long has it been since the last time you saw this show? For the past few years, I’ve had this problem with a few actors that are still around and I can’t recall who they were and if I had known them I would have remembered them!"|0
This story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. After all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. This story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. But it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life.|1
I just recently stumbled upon this show when ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered . . . I can't find a match for it. . . . This is the second season of the ABC-TV series . . . And this is the first I've seen. . . . Now, if I had a chance to see the series, I would have to have a search warrant. So, what exactly does this show have to do with me? . . . Oh! I don't have a clue! It is a comedy!|0
Great book , poorly done movie . Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest . Flat out boring , in fact . A must watch movie for any fans of this great series . If it doesn't go down in history , it's the least interesting of these series , so don't bother to do it . It's just the kind of movie where it gets really funny. In this case it's the sort of movie that people who like movies who don't like it will want to read .|0
This film is just another waste of time. The plot is ridiculous, forced USA drama. The characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic Goya and the bad interpretation of Bardem, who only was alright in his classic interpretation, when acting as french ally.Just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. I guess it was no a low budget film. Definitely not recommended. Maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. Maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema.No more hope in cinema...|1

"I have no respect for IMDb ratings anymore . I think a bunch of Mormons flooded the website and voted to make it a ""No"" to the ratings. Also, I don't really have a lot of time for an ad on my site, because it's a very small part of my work schedule and I'm hoping to do something a lot better. I am not really sure of why it's an issue but I think it's because the people who make it are getting paid and are being paid at least on average for doing the same things they did before."|0
i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about Tudor england.the writing directing was very good on a first read but i just read it in 2 hours so i'm just reading the book as if its a first draft, not a script. i think i just read it as if i wanted to give it an additional chapter. It's hard to find a reference to how it is actually written. I have only read it about a month and i still love it. I just find this book hard to find.|0
You know I only watched 15 minutes of this film , so I ca n't really describe how great it is! I just enjoyed the visuals and the art. The art was stunning as well, you just never knew what you would get and I am so glad I read this book. I hope I'm right and the book is just as good. Thank you. I will try to buy this book in two weeks. If you need anything I would just recommend it. I love this book! Thanks for sharing. I was thinking about giving it a try.|0
"This film has some pretty gorey parts like a boob getting bit off and a other big bites. Castle Freak himself is a good monster. I would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me. However, the movie had some dumb parts about it.A husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter. I suppose death is a greater damage than blindness, but you'd never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind. All they care about is that ""J.J.'s dead!"""|1
The Mod Squad isn't a movie, it's a void. That's the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching  I'd never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before. It's a film without any reason to exist whatsoever, seemingly consciously designed to appeal to no-one as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike. There is no plot, there is no characterisation, there are no set piece action scenes, there aren't even any scenes as such, just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second.|1
"Sam O'Steen , the film editor on the superlative suspense flick `` Rosemary 's Baby '' from 1968 , here. The main character of the film is a 16-year-old middle school student. It is about a boy who is trapped in a house and is able to come up with a plan to save the boy from becoming a vampire. The film starts with a dialogue which goes like this: ""I'm not going to hurt you, my love. You know why? Because if I'm a vampire, that means you have to die."""|0
"In Brooklyn , the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) has a simple but happy life dancing in a large auditorium with a stage in the corner. The nightclub is the focal point of his performance. It is one of New York's oldest, most prestigious dance clubs, dating to 1912, when it became the city's oldest dance venue, the New York Philharmonic Society . ""There's no shortage of dancing,"" Parker told The New York Times in a 2006 interview. Parker began dancing on the street, in an area of East Village, where he learned how to get into the clubs."|0
The first season was great - good mix of the job and the brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show.Now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone -- and the whole thing revolves around the airline company. Even the old man who runs the company has gone downhill - way too over the top, where before it was perfect.That and no more Sarah Mason - one of the best looking girls in Hollywood.This is what happens when you let some execs get their hands on a show.|1
go get your camcorder, your little brother, and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got yourself a film! well, that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'Nam. despite the really corny title, the horrible quality, the terrible actors, and the cliché writing, i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen. i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam.|1
"To think this film was made the year I was born. To think people are still having their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of ""homeland security"". To think this movie was intentionally banned from the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK addresses the political divide in the United States better than any movie I've ever seen. Had it been more widely seen, would it have changed anything? A movie like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you up and forces you to take sides."|1
I started off being interested somewhat in the movie . It appeared it might be serious drama , dealing with some aspects of American society . In the meantime, we had a couple of friends . I was looking to move out and I was a newbie so I wanted to go out and shoot something . The first one . I got a call , the second one I got it , the third one I went into the cinema . The fourth one got a call back . After that I started off looking into the cinema a bit more .|0
It 's true , no one really expects anything from sequels . But even by that low standard this is not the case. In fact, as we've seen on many films , it's not so much the quality of the action in the first few seconds of the film as it is the character's life story and relationships. In the story, the characters are being told to solve the problem of their own survival as a result of being trapped in a life-long struggle. It's also in this setting that the film focuses on the characters, their lives, and their relationship with the world they're in.|0
One of my favorite movies . I like horses , I like happy endings , and I like Walter Matthau . , I like the characters that I love but I don’t think any of them are as good as they should be . Some of the scenes you see on my TV show are not the same as in my movie, I think the characters in the films are different than the ones in the movie . I’ve only seen it once but I think I love it . . . . The characters that are there in the films in the film are just fantastic.|0
THE worst movie I 've ever seen , and I 've seen allot . Acting is horrible , plot is pretty awful , and casting is not what you would expect for a film that has been made and filmed . It is too bad that the original cast did not play the part in their own movies , but the acting was well done and the story was pretty well acted out , the acting was well done and the plot was nice and the cast was well acted in it was the only thing left to do .|0
`` Christmas in Connecticut '' is an absolute gem , and a must-see for Christmas ! Elizabeth Lane , a mother to a boy, has never felt the need to have Christmas. This Christmas in Connecticut comes to her in a new home when she was eight years old. This is a great home for Christmas , with a wonderful sense of care and care from a mother who is caring for the little boy , who is just a bit older. The boy has grown up and is so happy that he is going to do something for him in his own time !|0
While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film , it is not easy for a user to read and understand . It is easy for users to make mistakes , such as missteps , such as making mistakes , mistakes , missteps , mistakes that are not what the user is expecting , such as mistakes , which may be mistakes and mistakes that are not what the user should expect . If there is only one picture in the frame , then it would be better for the user to do it in a separate way .|0
I loved this movie when I was a teenager. LOVED it. It hasn't grown up with me, though. Maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'Goddammit' a lot. The lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime.|1
This is the worst movie I have ever seen . The story line is a joke , the effects are too dull, there's so much repetition . I was not the only person to watch this one . It's hilarious but I don't know that I can go back to any other great movie. I think this would have been the best movie ever, and I'm going to go and see it in a few weeks. What's funny is that when I think about this I don't really think about how I would spend my life if I was still doing this for 12 years now.|0
Nurse Charlotte Beale ( the lovely Rosie Holotik ) has arrived to Dr. Stephens ' clinic for the insane preparedness'. She takes the test with her staff and then goes straight to the phone. When the test is done she will come out of the room. She takes her money and goes into her bedroom, and is surprised when she finds out she has never been there. Then she goes back to Dr. Stephens and gives her the same treatment. At the end of her treatment she takes her phone back and tries to go home as normal.|0
This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films , most of which are not really sci-fi movies. There are more horror films that are in science-fiction, but these are mostly for movies that are not quite sci-fi. They're usually either horror movies or horror novels. These movies have a lot of horror movies that are pretty much sci-fi movies - I can't remember which horror movie you've played. They're probably not sci-fi movies as well, they're probably also horror movies in the first place.|0
"I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl & two boys. As I lived this situation and get lost in it, I hope a similar story would inspire me. My major concerns are: - Why (a) & How (b) the triangle forms ? - Why (c) & How (d) the triangle degenerates ? (a) The movie offers a plain answer: ""because it's better !"". (b) here, it's an open triangle: the three share things together."|1
I saw this movie yesterday , and like most allrdy wrote `` i also expected a Steven movie '' , so I don`t know what to expect with the movie ..... I guess it`ll be a little different because I have not seen it .. so I'm guessing you`ll be ok .... but I think it`ll be a good movie ....... I think I'll wait for a longer time until I see more of the movie, so I have to wait another two weeks ! I guess I will see the movie again soon .. ..... I dunno ....|0
This movie is terrible , it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to transform the entire world. But the truth is, she was in a love-hate relationship with her boyfriend. I can only imagine the reaction I would get from a few of my friends. They were so close with Katie and I, and we were in love that it was impossible to pretend that it would ever happen again. As a kid I had always been incredibly lucky when it comes to relationships, and there were many things to think about when it came time to actually get involved in the movie.|0

From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again . This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the Dutch cinema . It was made in the early nineties in Amsterdam and released on April 26 2005 . The German-language film is about a young boy with an odd combination of dreams and dreams of love and danger. It is about a group of people from a village in a remote location of an abandoned town . In one of the first scenes of the movie , the group is walking along one of the wooden tracks that runs alongside the village street.|0
"When the word ""presents"" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. For some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However, I've always been willing to give the second installment of the Demons trilogy a try. For one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another, well, two words: Asia Argento."|1
"OK,I've seen over 100 Troma films, and some of them are pretty bad. ""Sizzle Beach U.S.A."" was horrible, and ""I Was A Teenage TV Terrorist"" was unwatchable, but this is THE WORST FILM IN THE TROMA LIBRARY!A bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape.This is really terrible. Even as exploitation films go. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs."|1
Cuore Sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired . With a script that's not only visually appealing and a story to read , but has an element of mystery and intrigue that will make you feel that you have something to look for in a story. You'll be amazed at just how much the characters have to say and how the story can be structured to tell a story without all the complication. Treat it as if the story is a story of love and hate. As a story that's about two young people in love together, that's not quite the story.|0
This is, for different reasons, a very very bad action movie. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement. Secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about a smart and mean masterbrain and Chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action ? Well, the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the Alcatraz jail. They shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of required ammunition, the bodycount is rather low.|1
Comedy ? What 's so funny about watching an ugly deadbeat alcoholic attending 6 sessions ( by the time I saw him) ? Was he drunk, but a little drunk? Or maybe drunk enough to start all over in the next few sessions? I'm not really sure how to judge them. It's funny to say, but they have a very simple explanation for why, I know, I think it was, but in fact they aren't so bad. Anyway, in the meantime, I've been going to a bunch of movies. I love them.|0
Rififi, directed by Jules Dassin, is in line with the Melville crime pictures (particularly Bob le Flameur and to a point Le Cercle Rouge) of being totally focused on story and character and making sure not a word is spoken that doesn't need, and was ahead of its time. Ionically, it still has a kind of professionalism among its characters, a kind of respect (if not for selves than for others, a kind of duty) that rings well in post-WW2 France. Its actors carry faces for these characters that say 'we know what these guys are about', and from there the story takes off.|1
"I agree with msinabottle ; this is a great movie . Here are some dialogue snippets : Raisuli ( Sean Connery )

Heck, this is actually quite good as well. He has some dialogue to speak about a bit of what makes it interesting in my opinion. I’m not an expert on film and have not played many films but I like to think he is quite good. A great film by a real person as well. I would like to give this one a big thumbs down if it is as good or better in terms of the story as you describe."|0
"This is, arguably, the worst of the major Ava Gardner films. Yes, she is gorgeous. But that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend that he's Eddie Bracken (which surely embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (! ), and Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains a major popular song, ""Speak Low."""|1
Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock 's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director , pairing Carole King with David Fincher , and it's almost as exciting as he could be, at least to say it, but it's just as funny as the most famous man in the world. And it's almost as funny as the most famous person in the world, which, in its own way, makes for an entirely different cinema. For the first time, we've been introduced to the man, Alfred Hitchcock.|0
Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen. Obviously this isn't intentional though. It takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). It certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like a RSC thespian. It is amazing that films like this get commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about £20 to make.|1
"Well, at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. Instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of Asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in America, they now discovered they could simply hire the Asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. That's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! ""The Messengers"" is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the Oriental countries ever since ""Ringu""."|1
"But it's not. The plot isn't all that bad, the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent. Instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those ""I can't believe he/she is so dumb"" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going. It frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character. Also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie. Anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up."|1
Although i don't like cricket at all and i have seen this movie 13 years ago, I still think it is one of the best coming-of-age movies ..i remember the day i returned home from my school and sat down to have my lunch, I saw the opening titles of that movie and then....i was so immersed in it that i felt i was there, it really affected me personally. i still remember how i felt when i first saw it ,i felt that the poor boy was a friend of mine, going through the same adolescent experience we were having in those days.|1
It 's schmaltzy , but then what else did you expect ? The heroine is Cinderella 's younger sister complete with a red cape , and the older is Cinderella 's older sister . And then what else is that character , and why do you think she is a good one , but not a great one . She is beautiful but not strong . She has so many flaws . But if you read the rest of her novels , she really does have flaws . But that is because of her flaws , because of her weakness , , , and , and no .|0
This is a stereotype plot . A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and gets the other fighter's attention. The fighters are told to keep quiet and they do. They are supposed to keep their guns on the line. And it is not to say that the fighters got away . This is one of the most common stories. And it goes on for many fights. But it is not the only example . One of the earliest examples. It happens to be the last example . I was on my way home this morning .|0
"Would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word ""STUPID"" over and over again? Probably.This is arguably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. Even though it was actually *with friends* and at one of their *birthday parties,* I had to leave. I actually had to leave. I just excused myself and walked out."|1
"This thing , directed by french sensation Patrick Sebastien , is worst than all the turkeys that you may have ever seen! It is the sort of game that we all like to play, but we also like to see and hear what we feel in the air as we sit here. So, here is a story of a boy he has been in his teens. He is the oldest boy in our house. He's 5'1"" and has just finished his 10th birthday. The boy is the last of his friends and the closest he has to anyone in the household."|0
I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film. Trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.There were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and Kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the World Championship. There were other shots of Kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where Deep Blue was located. This just looked like filler.Also, I didn't find it interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and seeing an IBM techie trying, unsuccessfully to 'open' it.|1
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. People just don't act that way in real life situations. My question is: Who would fund such crap?The movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. Next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes.|1
I am from Romania ... and for that i apologize if my English is not so good.i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed. I always liked Wesley Snipes's movies but this one is terrible. I regret that I spent over 3 hours downloading this film. There are a lot mistakes in the film. For example, the stadium in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the soccer team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli.The scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images: video replays, live images etc.|1
`` The Bone Snatcher '' starts out extremely promising , with the introduction of a new and original type of device for the Bone Snatcher'' , as shown in the diagram in FIG. 8A. There are several components to the Bone Snatcher which are shown in the diagram. The bone snatcher is the original device on which bone is placed in position to be received. The bone snatcher is generally used when the user is not at home or at work. The bone snatcher may be used also for other tasks, e.g., watching images or reading music.|0
"The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment, which was (thank God) the last one. None of the three sequels did justice to the highly entertaining original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit the name of the ""Magnificent Seven"" and Bernstein's rousing music theme. The production values resemble those of a made-for-TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts ""II"" and ""III"" you couldn't remember their names, here you can't even remember their faces."|1
Watching this odd little adventure movie , it 's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who directed some of your favorite movies in the 80s. It 's something I have had to deal with before I 've really become aware that it 's a pretty cool idea and it's just the way it should be. So I 've watched it once myself, and I just don 't remember the time. It 's like I have no idea what that's supposed to feel. It's kind of weird when you 're talking about movies with nothing to hide.|0
"""Christmas in Connecticut"" is an absolute gem, and a must-see for Christmas! Elizabeth Lane, a precursor to Martha Stewart, is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers--the perfect wife, mother, and domestic goddess. Only thing is, she is none of these things--a total phony. Unfortunately for her, she is about to be found out. Her publisher, Mr. Alexander Yardley (a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth's ""perfect farm"" for the Christmas holiday."|1
This is one of the strangest things on TV . It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called the St Mary's Cathedral . In it there is a scene about a group of women . This is not an unusual scene for me. When I watched it I loved it , and I'm glad it got me to see what I loved. But I do not have any particular memory of the scene , so I am not going to attempt to explain it. It was an unusual scene, not to be taken lightly. It was very dramatic.|0
In this film, we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree.|1
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew and was also very entertaining to watch. As I said earlier I have been watching a variety of movies for about two weeks now and it made a big impression watching them. So far, that's a good thing. But if you don't watch them in the theaters, you can watch them on Netflix. That way if you are in the theater and you get the chance of seeing a bunch of characters from the film you have a chance to see all of the things that are interesting.|0
I was wondering when someone would try turning that whole Matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. Anyroad, here's a few things I learned about Mexico from watching this film.~All Mexican Women Are Super Hot - Remember that little desert town in Unearthed? Yeah, well, this must be it's Mexican sister city. Don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. She'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! ~Half of Mexico is controlled by insane Satan-worshiping Palo Mayombe cultists.|1
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school. I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles. I think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things, or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles. its a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto, Ontario. so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there, watch this movie.|1
This movie really is that bad, and I'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. Seeing this is like OD'ing on pure SUCK. Now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have waded through every title from Full Moon and Troma, all the movies of Edward D. Wood Jr, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and direct to DVD-flicks from faded men-of-action. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a vast array of the movies that MST3K covered, but in their original form.|1
There is only one word to define the whole movie , that is : awful . How `` Mostly Martha Stewart , who is just a brilliant comic book artist. He has done a tremendous work in the history of comic book art. His art can stand as a testament to the spirit of his artist, but it can't be compared to those of the other great comic book artists! The movie does a pretty good job of keeping the characters as cool as possible . The main problem is, how much is the movie supposed to depict the characters that the movie does?|0
I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released . Sure , it was great, but in reality it was not. The music and the soundtrack were absolutely wonderful and I would say its one of the greatest music in the history of film . This was probably the worst movie in my childhood . This is the first time I´ve seen it since the first film with the original movie. As you can see there was no music , nothing else . There was nothing on any soundtrack or movie. Just the soundtrack , nothing else.|0
The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made . Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero . Whether dealing with day to day problems, or getting lost in traffic or traffic jams on the roads, he is the man I know. Rudy Ray Moore isn't one to forget. His films have done more damage than most people know, and he is far from alone in his opinion. But if you're looking for a true hero who can take the lives of someone else's kids and go home with them, read the film. It's got some interesting characters who are capable of making their own decisions.|0
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark , mysterious journey that takes the viewer into a world that is about to be put off by a lack of security. We have to understand that it’s going to get very, very ugly. The main theme of the story, and the plot, has been to protect the safety of the street. This is a very unique situation, and I think we can say with certainty that we have lost this city. There are not enough people. There are not enough street people.|0
Breathtaking at it's best, intriguing at it's worst, Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century, and in my opinion, the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff, and with a particular interest in war films, I've seen many films, which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so.|1
then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the film skipped many years forward with the French ruling Spain. The movie does little to fill you in on what happened, and I don't remember much about it. So, the movie gets confusing then. The movie begins when Ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of Judiasm by the church, specifically Father Lorenzo. She is put to the Question and forced to confess. Even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison.|1
The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus , a (very small) number of people may die in a world where the majority of people have genetic mutations . The world is going to be a much more diverse one than the average American . So how do you determine the rate of change of genomes? We’ll give you how we can find these mutations in a gene pool of the genome. For example, you could look at the average mutation rate in the population and determine what changes occur.|0
OK, this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence; nor to its visual shock value; nor, for that matter, to the melancholic suspense of the second installment. No, it's surprisingly and refreshingly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The tongue-in-cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force. The moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a)Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b)sublimation of violence into homo-erotics; c)humorous detonation of an impossible buildup.|1
Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear . . . “I know what Teddy bears are. I knew what he was worth and what it would take to have them. I didn’t like the thought of it, but I thought Teddy Bear was the one that really got the most love from the world. He was the one that I love, and I just want to put in my time and space and be able to see what it all means for me.|0
"If you're looking for a movie that's fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about the not so great acting, cheesy ""special"" effects, and typical sci-fi plot...then this is the movie for you! Not at the acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually fairly decent. The special effects weren't the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer animated. There was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the entire movie."|1
Having just seen Walt Disney 's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube , I couldn't believe what had become of it and was shocked to hear that it had not just been the Skeleton Dance... Here I am talking to you guys and they seem to think that I was right about the video. And the video of the Skeleton Dance is pretty amazing. So let's get a better look! What is it about the video that is really impressive in its own right? The music is great and it's a bit of a drag!|0
"First of all, i have nothing against Christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. But i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! What a waste of believers' money. They'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. I don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this ""movie"", because I couldn't find any of those in this. Story's simple - two reporters, one (A) is atheist, the other (B) for some sake has abandoned religion."|1
One of the best,Lackawanna BluesGreat movie,great cast,great music,this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes,I will w3atch this one many times. This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period.|1
I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington , Ky last night . After a wonderful night with friends I was excited to meet so many great people who have been making their dreams come true in the last few weeks . They're all people who have been there, seen them, listened to them and had a great time . The movie was a really great show and is a great example of how great people can be. My favorite is the movie that came out just a few days before we were going to the big show. This is a great movie .|0
I saw this version about a decade ago , and have been looking for it ever since . I just wanted to update my story, because it was a new version for me . I was going to try out something similar , and have not been able to get past it , and it took some work , but it turned out great. If you would like to try it out , just copy and past this . What I found so interesting was that when it was added to the database, I had to check if it was already in the database when using a SQL statement on a query.|0
This extraordinary pseudo-documentary , made in 1971 , perfectly captures the zeitgeist of America today ... which makes it all the more interesting and informative for any reader, if he thinks it's worth sharing. But it has a long way to go if we take this piece and put it in front of a global audience. If you want to know what is really happening in the world and what's going on behind it, here's a brief look at some of the ways that things can happen and what is happening in these places and how things can make their way on to what's happening around us.|0
First of all , let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I 'd been sold on this. I am sure there are some things I can think of to improve on that but there is a lot I don't really like about the movie . it is a little bit too close to the surface of the world. And I just couldn't help it at the time. I was hoping to watch this for myself in order to get a better grasp on the movie but to no avail. When I finally finished watching it I was happy.|0
"Having enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken. Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Although it tries to represent ""civilised warfare"" in the form of sport, science, trade and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals.Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme."|1
Norm ( an ) ally I do n't mind remakes . There are some pretty good ones out there , and in fact I know they are the best, but I would have to buy that one anyway. It has been around for a while now, I have been looking around and they seem to be a very good thing , and I hope they stay with a good quality. It depends on who you talk to in a conversation. If you are not in a conversation (e.g. a family meeting) you can't get in a discussion unless you have been speaking on the phone for about two hours.|0
The Evil Below starts on 'The Straits of San Sebastian 1683' as the 17th century treasure ship the El Diablo sinks in a violent thunderstorm. Jump to 'The Straits of San Sebastian Present Day' where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, the come across the sunken wreck of the El Diablo & explore it but are attacked & killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns & runs a boat-for-hire named the 'Vagrant Viking' which caters for tourists who want to fish, dive & generally explore the islands.|1
Oh how awfully this movie is! I don't know if it is a horror film or a drama, cause the story and the both genres are not established very well! The story is not moving, it is slow, boring, and sleepy from the beginning to end. This movie really bores me! But I really liked the camera work, it is authentic, fresh and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it hasn't made me to jump from my seat.|1
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War . The largest front of the whole conflict, the Berlin Wall had already been opened for a couple of weeks. In the last days of the war, thousands of German troops and equipment had been brought in to make a major front for the rest of the war, and all of those troops had been made available to Poland to be sent to join the Second World War under the command of Marshal Werner Heizmann, the former Reichsfreiherzin of the Holy Roman Empire . . .|0
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood, I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday, since it originally played on USA networks. Does Anyone know where to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again.|1
I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only a kid but this movie has always had a lot more depth to it. It's not just a story told from the outside, it has more twists, turns and so on, and most of the way the plot is built around a woman whose husband is a killer. So if you're going to do a movie where you're looking for a man who kills his own wife, or the wife of another guy who has a husband, make a movie that tells you about that man.|0
I cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. I've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. I haven't made a comment on IMDb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. It is a piece of sh*t. The writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager.|1
"I can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles from being an expert, and I'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading Into Thin Air, and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on. There is some good climbing footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film ""How much experience above 8000 metres do you have?"|1
I just saw a terrible film called The Sleeping Dictionary . One reviewer on Four Word Film Review ( www.fwfr.com ) was calling for a film like this if only because it has so many flaws and flaws! What are the flaws of The Sleeping Dictionary? Well, first of all there are many flaws in it, and secondly there are a lot of flaws about it, so if you think it's a good idea to see this film, why not, just tell me about it first. There are a bunch of things you can think of and try and get to know about.|0
Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in . I have not seen all of it yet as I don't know if this is a bad idea. But he was in it. But for the most part, it was as good a role as any. If you have seen a movie or video and you remember the first time it, you know that it wasn't the first or the second movie of the series it wasn't the first time that you watched it. There are more films like this than you'll ever be able to remember and I'm sure many will.|0
It really is a great film (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny). Julie is, as usual, wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket, London on its release. However Julie's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not.|1
This movie purports to show a middle class family 's attempt to figure out what is `` going down '''s road to be '''' when they get hit by a plane. They can't even remember '''' how ''they'' will be hit by that plane'' when they get to '''' where they have a chance to escape. I'm not sure I can say anything about this movie, it seems to be about ''''s life''s, ''''what they did, ''''the ''''''''s life.''|0
"Yes, why? Among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, infuriating some times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me switch on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. Van Sant's ""Psycho"" however, gives me pause. Why? I wonder."|1
I recently rented this promising mini series, I didn't even know they had adapted it for television. I was really looking forward to it since the book Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I have ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot only loosely resembles the one in the book, the characters are completely miscast and there's some appalling acting. A shame really. The story behind Icon is perfect for the silver screen, but I think television budgets just aren't big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.Forsyth deserves much, much better than this.|1
Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'Memento' and quite rightfully so. Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknowns to me and I suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all believable and that's all they need to be.|1
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands , but given Uwe Boll 's track record it would have made sense to have made the move, given the lack of competition in that section of the country. 4. I'm not much of a sports fan, and I'm more interested in seeing how the track team fares against the other teams from the United States at the end of the season . I don't have enough knowledge to judge the other teams on that point. I'll do the math, however, and let you know how it compares.|0
So what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks? I know, become a pop star! This documentary - and I use the term loosely - follows the trials and tribulations of Colton as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic (read: dance) music. I only wish Mr Ford's voice was as muscular as his arms...sorry to say his vocals are painfully thin. There isn't much interesting going on here but Mr Ford and friends are eye candy.See him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune.|1
Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey . With its unique style and tone, you can be sure that this new TV series is truly Turkish-friendly . It’s all about the characters, the action, the performances and the story itself . And there are also tons more twists and turns, which make it even better when watched in Turkish, English and Arabic. “Teknik” is a series which was created as a result of my love for the first TV series of the Turkish tradition of Turkish-language television broadcasting.|0
By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+ . Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely think it is about racism. . . . This is also a cartoon that is based on the KKK. But the cartoons are based on white supremacist propaganda. Therefore the cartoons must be racist and not just racist. . . . They must show racism (or at least that’s the way I think of it). And then, why would any child ever consider a “hate crime” that they don’t think they’re “racist”?|0
For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film ( `` like , why does he show so much excitement ?'' ? ), you can easily see why he was so good. He was as good as anyone that ever made films, and in most of the films he was even good. He didn't do too much work that he was great, but his movies made it easy for him to show what the world could expect to see, and it wasn't hard to see how his work could help improve the movie industry for future generations.|0
"I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this ""film"". This movie has no redeeming factors. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I have a difficult time understanding how someone could enjoy this movie, let alone sing its ""praises"". The idea is horrible, certain scenes linked to the plot (such as the continued love story even though the male romantic interest is a SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to do myself bodily harm while watching them."|1
"Let me tell you something...this movie exceeds all of the Troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it ACTUALLY TRIES TO COME ACROSS AS A SERIOUS MOVIE. From the terrible acting... ""I knew it, I knew she was possessed! ""...to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers...this piece of dung takes the cake. I am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad. This may just be in a class all its own. The kicker is that supposedly some Cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation."|1
The film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour , but nothing more . The film has taken many a time to develop and improve it. However, it has also given the idea of how men and women are affected differently by a forced labor , and how they react and react to their own condition . This post will highlight the different ways men can feel and experience their condition, and the ways the film does not take the issue of forced sex or the lack of sexual gratification into account .|0
I 'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask . I am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film enthusiast. I love watching movies, but it is not as easy as watching a movie that makes me laugh. I enjoy watching other people. When I first watched MirrorMask for the first time, it wasn't much but then it was the best movie ever made. And I was already pretty excited for it. I've watched it thousands of times, and it made me chuckle. It's the best of the best, and I'm thrilled.|0
Hellraiser : Bloodline is only a so-so film . I believe it 's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I don't care about that one thing, it's fucking stupid ! . . . . , I've read it all along, and I've had it all planned. It's brilliant, but I'm pretty certain it's not going to work. But I'm not saying the story shouldn't be good enough, but I'm saying I have a very hard time believing that even if it was possible it wouldn't work .|0
By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+. Kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk, and act like the characters portrayed. I am disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to air this terrible program. The Wayan's Brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. Usually The young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice-overs for cartoons and then as they grow older, they move up to programs for young adults.|1
"George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance. ""The Mad Monster"" is no exception to that rule. It is by all standards a poor (if entertaining) film. The filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days. Still, Zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist.The film itself is enjoyable on a camp level."|1
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Cole, and who had to take it the wrong way to keep the cast together. But it did get the attention it deserved for making a successful TV series in a time when all of these great cast-offs had a lot to live up to. And the cast was one of those cast-offs, not necessarily good ones. As far as I’ve been able to tell, the AFFAIR was very poor. Most of the TV movie adaptations were made during the 1970s and the 1970s, at least.|0
Dolelemite ( 1975 ) is a cult classic . Starring Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero out to wrong a man for his own good, the film is the only film in which Moore is not portrayed by a villain, despite the fact the character is in fact the villain in the film. The film is a sequel to Miracle on Ice ( 1979 ) that is released in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, and was nominated for two Academy Award. The film is an adapted version of the film's original concept.|0
I 'm a Petty Officer 1st Class ( E-6 ) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and was promoted to Officer 4th Class E-4. We are the most qualified E-6/E-2 class E-4 and we are now looking to become the next E-6, E-3 and E-2/3 class. E-5 has not yet returned and we do not know who will continue to be the next E-6. I am looking forward to helping to fill the positions as soon as I can. We are also a couple more than 2 weeks behind E-5 and so I will need to continue working with others as I learn more and more.|0
I was a still photographer working in Europe the summer that Jim Salter shot the movie Three.I did some swell work on a camera. I decided to take the picture that Jim took.I started off by taking pictures with the frame.I then decided the picture was worth the money.I knew I would need to get a lot of shots, so I decided to do some work on the photo.I figured if I don’t shoot with a lot of frames, I should try to avoid using frames. I decided on the frame I was using.I decided to take several pictures that would fit into three different size formats.|0
Never mind the serious logic gaps , never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals , never mind the haphazard writing that is just as well-done as it actually is. I would much rather spend the weekend with my boyfriend than to visit him and get to know him more or less. Not because he’s going to want to go with me or because it would be embarrassing or because I feel like I’ve done him wrong , but because he could be so much better off doing the things that make him special and so much more special than he is , or because we’ve always been so close.|0
Surprisingly well-acted , well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom : his favorite heavy metal band . . . There was no need to play the piano at the concert – there was only one instrument. I don't know what it was like in his childhood, and I don't know what he did. He didn't play a song to the tune of his favorite band, though he had a bandmate from high school. And the band wasn't very well-acted either, which is why I have to wonder if the song was written by the band members.|0
"When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"" where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end."|1
"This is my first `` awful '' rating ever on IMDb and I could n't think of a more deserving one. I was hoping, though, to make it work asap but I am not 100% sure what the real reason I am rating it on imdb is, as I can only remember it being an opinion on its own, and I'm curious if I would have thought of a better way. Well, here's what I have found out:

Imdb can't handle ratings on a scale of 1 to 4."|0
I 'm not a big fan of musicals , but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth 's looks , and she seems to understand it very well. So I 've been in touch with the Hayworths , and I would love for her to share some of that with my son . I 'm excited to be back , but I do feel that I need to work on my work , and I just don 't feel I need to get involved again . So how 'll I do that ? So I have to figure this out , let me know what I can do that would help me so much ?|0
First , let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel , so maybe I am directing my imagination on a false premise, but let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel , because I know that in my own personal opinion, Balzac makes an impression on my personal life . It is easy to read a Balzac novel , especially one that deals with a character's character and the difficulties of the story, so it is not easy to learn how to read the novel, so if I wanted to learn some, I would do it myself.|0
"Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen , it is such a piece of shambles. Its one of my favorites . I know you are looking at this but you really need to see it if you want to understand it lol

The reason why Sadie does this is so that she doesn't feel bad about it. She can't sit still, can't even walk. She has to walk because she has to go to work every hour to get to work. She's also the only one to sit at the top of the escalator."|0
As I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai 's 1994 movie Ashes of Time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit, I was just stunned at how well I managed to watch it. It’s still entertaining in the end, I think but I am a huge fan of it’s originality, and while the re-edit is something to really enjoy, it was very disappointing for me to see that I was never given to the idea that the movie is a good story and I’d have no interest in telling it again, other than having to do a bunch of sequels to get a better ending.|0
"`` Yagyu ichizoku no inbo '' ( let 's just say `` The Shogun 's Samurai '' ) is somewhere in Tokyo but he doesn't really know about it though, is he a samurai? And why do you even bother telling him to go and get shogyo? :D
<shimono> hm, it would be fun to get the manga to play, that's for sure. But it wouldn't do well at the theater, so you might as well just give me the book for free and then leave now."|0
...the last time I laughed this much. It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance.|1
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in North Carolina. He had been walking along the coast of Cape Fear for nearly 2 ½ years before he started to walk on the beaches of North Carolina. I’m sure this is what he told a couple of friends. “I just wanted you to know that I have known your family very, very, very, very well, very close to you” He had told this story many years before. “You know, I can only think of one way of saying it.|0
CAUTION: SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion. This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e.|1
Hilary was great as julie, and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi, but there should have been more references towards the other three movies! I mean, come on! First off, Where's Daniel!? Miyagi makes a very brief mention of him and that's it. Daniel was his best friend and should've at least made an appearance in the movie. He could've helped Miyagi train Julie-San! On the flip side, the music stayed true to the movie though, with a little more instrumentation(Fretless Bass)to accompany the wonderfully played Pan-Flute!|1
This was a fantastic movie about two people , one a young teenage girl , and the other , a middle-aged girl. The girl was playing a prank on her boyfriend by having sex on her couch in the hotel , which was then taken to a bar for drinks , which was taken to another hotel , where they had a long conversation and drank a little too much. She had been working all night and hadn't slept because the night had been cold , and the guy was on the phone when they spoke on the phone but couldn't make a phone call.|0
This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent . The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the introduction of Mr. T’Coffie and Mr. P’s wedding - which seems to imply that he’s a serious businessman. In the last six years there’s been a decline in the value of “wedding money” in the United States. The idea that he could give away $100 million worth of his wedding ring to get into the Olympics seems to be a little exaggerated - and that was when he was a little late - but a great deal of the book was written in the 1960s.|0
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that, I believe, is not equaled today. The colorful characters - in their stereotypical garb - brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed. Wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then. A kid could watch it without watching an episode of Jerry Springer.Looking back now (I was 5 at the time), although I loved both Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed Warrior more because of his mystique. Hogan was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image.|1
One of the best , Lackawanna BluesGreat movie , great cast , great music , this is one of those songs that is good for the heart . But now we know that this is a song about being the only person in the world with a life. I think that the songs about love, life , love are very very good . But it is also a song about having a family . But we don't know whether this is a good song for the body or whether it is a song for the soul. I think that is what this is about .|0
OK , last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader 's The Exorcist : The Beginning at the End of Life. And I knew I'd be the last man standing on the other end of the show. And the first thing that struck me was that so far as I've been able to grasp the concept of what's actually a reality, that's exactly what I need to say. I mean, I think the thing that makes the difference is that if you do that, you've created an illusion of reality.|0
In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp's life in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (come on who else could play the part?) and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing. For me Hurt is Crisp and I've always found it very hard to take the man himself because Hurt was more him than he was himself. Its masterful performance. His equal is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's long time friend and confidant.Unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it.|1
I thought I was going to see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to Hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring!!! The acting in it was pretty pathetic. In fact, it looked as though some people from an Evangelic Church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members. It wasn't real-life dialog at all.|1
being a fan of Bela Lugosi,Boris Karloff,and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of Lugosi,Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips,that do not gel with the new black and white footage.not even close to Steve martins dead men don't wear plaid,that was done great.with all the technology we have now why was'nt this done better?if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change,be warned this is really bad.|1
`` My Blue Heaven '' is boring . The plot is insipid ; the characterizations and dialogue stink ; the action and dialog are terrible. The first half of this episode does not make me mad, but when I read the episode, it looks like a parody. The third half does. The final scene does. A good plot and character development . The ending, the first half of the season, the fifth and final season, and finally the whole episode, is bad enough. But I think it has a lot to do with the final episode of season three.|0
Okay, I love this movie!!!!! I watched it over and over again. It is so hard to tell who the attacker is. You keep thinking it's one person, then another, then back to the first person, then another person. It is so suspense full you want to fast forward your TV to the end to see who it is.SUMMARY: Gail Osborne is raped and left at her home. She is in the hospital and begins to tell the story of how she was raped.|1
When the Legends Die is a powerful , moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become one of the most powerful Indian leaders of the 20th century. The Legend dies when he is captured by the Indians. It is the stories of the heroes that form the story of how they survived the wars of the Middle Ages. An Indian warrior who fought in the war against British troops during World War I who survived and fought to the end was a hero and one of the most powerful of the American heroes. His father was killed during a fight in the battlefields of France during World War I.|0
Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna was a two-part star studded historical T.V . movie based on the Peter Kurth novel that had been made three weeks before the film release of the film had been put on a Blu-ray. In it, the protagonist, a woman (played by a woman) in her mid-forties, is accused of a series of sexually explicit images, and a woman who is the daughter of a German-based publisher. Her story has been written by the writer and her editor (Astrid DeMille) and is based on a series of two novels written and co-written for the film.|0
I rented this movie , because I noticed the cover in the video rental store . I saw Nolte , which was my first day to see the movie because I rented the DVD , in the video rental store i found it , I went into the movie and it was about to show my house , but after some time I noticed , that the inside of the DVD was empty , but there were some images on it with images on it , in the image, and on it there was the picture , but I noticed no image on the movie , it was just empty .|0
Arnold fans will holler in joy, fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment, and Catholics will just holler.Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and ham-handedly directed by Peter Hyams, *End of Days* gets The Terminator out of his open-backed hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart operation), whilst blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blaspheming Biblical verse to give Catholics something more to whine about.It is 1999 and doom-sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn.|1
A less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence. Some Northern idiots come to the deep South looking for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary Whiskey Mountain. They are menaced by scary hillbillies, in a wide nod to 'Deliverance'; but it turns out that the hicks are fronting for a Northern marijuana-trafficking badass. This is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist. The women are locked up and raped into catatonia; rather than rescuing them, the guys run down to town to get the sheriff, who is lazy and doesn't believe them.|1
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that did n't really show how much there is going to be for this film but I think that was the point of the film. Now, what is going to happen next in the movie? Are there any other interesting characters or things you want to say about the film? They have to go for it, yes, and they're trying to tell it right from the start. That's the way I thought it was going to be.|0
George Sluizer 's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time . Why was he so important? Perhaps because of the fact that, while there are many of the things I wanted to learn from it, he was absolutely brilliant at it - he did it every time! But I don't think he ever learned how to film the same thing over again. There's a good reason for the difference. He was the only man in Hollywood who made the films he did, and that meant he didn't get to make one for himself.|0
I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive sequence of events. In fact, I’ve recently been thinking about whether or not to take a nap when I’m at home and when I’m with my family. In that case, how would I feel about going to the Castro? The answer to that question would be much more interesting than I was thinking. I think I would prefer to stay up until the wee hours of the morning.|0
"You have to like baseball, and you have to at least sort of like Tom Selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. Selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?) to Japan as his career winds down. Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Great supporting performances by Selleck's manager (""Japan's Clint Eastwood""), his girl friend Takanashi, and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball."|1
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed, creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic), manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'La Double Vie de Veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie, that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story, masterfully directed, excellent main actors, masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen.|1
Animated shorts just do n't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film . This short feature is dripping with action as we get to watch one of the world's most intense battles. The action gets a lot better as the scene shifts, as well as we get a lot less action! The action moves a little bit more quickly but the camera still captures more of the action than the film. This film was shot in and out of Toronto, Ontario in the mid 1980s and has been around since 1985. It's not too bad in that way, so that's another story about it.|0
( This has been edited for space ) Chan-wook Park 's new film is a complex film that is not only beautiful but at the same time an excellent introduction to film history. The film will be a good introduction to history, but the film is not the most well thought-out film out there. There are many fine details in the film, including the various characters, characters, backgrounds, locations, etc. and some of the details can change without a break or change of focus. This film is meant for young children to learn about film history so they can try to understand history better.|0
This film has made e mad. I believe the original of this film ,'The Mask', was an awesome film, worth buying and watching a lot. I strongly believed that they should make a sequel, but when i saw this, i thought again.This film has spoilt the whole idea of 'The Mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying around in a room? My little brother who is seven didn't even laugh, and he is into these childish movies, but this was worse. A load of crap!!|1
There's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima(Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpion, and a dangerous group of thugs(..including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady), operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist, does just that. Hell hath no fury like Scorpion, and a determined detective, Gondo(Mikio Narita), seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her, will do whatever it takes(..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts)to catch Nami.|1
"Everything you do in this world should make at least a little bit of sense. Unfortunately very little of ""Delusion"" makes any sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as the main squeeze of hit man Kyle Secor. Secor on the other hand overacts to the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the embezzling yuppie is very unbelievable as the novice, revenge seeking, adversary. When Jennifer Rubin gives back the money she has carefully been concealing, all credibility flies out the window, and the guns pointing final showdown between Secor and Metzler is beyond ridiculous."|1
I looked forward to watching this film since I loved the David Lynch version. In my first attempt at watching it I fell asleep. Nothing was happening. The next night I tried to watch the rest, and again it was putting me to sleep! Nothing ever happened in this movie that could keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it got a bit more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disk which contained bonus material. Needless to say, I had no hard to go through the torture of watching more of Dune (2000).|1
Boring movie . Poor plot . Poor actors . The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco. How can we explain this? . Or is this not a movie? . How can we tell if it's a bad movie, or if a bad guy is in it? . We'll have to see if we can find out how to look for the actors, and what to make it better for the movie, but we might as well just find out all of the actors and put the bad guy back in the game.|0
"I've never been a big Larry Clark fan, but somehow, I've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. Now, I like independent films, and I grew up very much into punk rock, and I'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. Not every punk song incorporates ""Oi!"" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.But the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion."|1
This is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while. It's not funny at all. It simply portrays a lower class Northern British setting. I find it a very sad film at parts, at others cuts are where they shouldn't be. One thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie. I only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the end.This movie completely loses the attention of the audience.|1
Man, I can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie. Okay, it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art. But it is a good deal of entertainingly tacky fun. For starters, the titular pumpkin-headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and unscary things to ever stumble in front of a camera; he looks like something you would see in a fourth-rate carnival spookhouse. Secondly, the moderate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra-conservative woman gets electrocuted by a toaster.|1
Bought for £1 , Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Wooden acting , it has all of the elements of the movie that you would like to see more of . The director has got everything going on in the movie except for one thing he can not do . This movie has done very well , but it is not very good . There are two things wrong in this movie that you will not get on television . For the most part you will not catch any of these things . In the end it is not clear how to fix it .|0
This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself.|1
I'd heard about this movie, but didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies. I wasn't disappointed. He's become a fine actor, showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother, to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own, and other's, esteem.|1
"Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances...captures the spirit of the 80's; the slang of the mainstreams and the outcasts. A wonderful rendition of high school life and ""gritty downtown"" from a suburban perspective.The soundtrack contains songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola$, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men At Work, The Flirts and Bananarama.This movie truly is Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) set in 1980's Los Angeles."|1
This movie was pathetically awful . The sound was terrible , the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating . And so I had to do a better job editing a lot of my scenes , but there was no reason not to when I made the movies . And so it was the only way to do what I could . So what I have to show you, the movie, is the real story of what happened last time . There's a couple of elements that should be taken with some degree of confidence . I like to know the characters, their motivations, who is who and where they're from .|0
"""Tart"" is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying: ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else"". Writer/Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 Million movie that ends up someplace else. ""Tart"" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.Unlike the standard Swain film, ""Tart"" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer."|1
I will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that I thought it stunk. The great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. No telling what you will come out of the film with. For me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. There was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino.|1
"The director of this movie is a famous french TV presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. It's the story of a young retarded person, called ""Zep"" (sic). A night, he sees his sister's SM sexual relation, and decide to do the same thing: he rape the girl who he loves! Zep is placed in a asylum, and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. One man will find them. One man will reunite them. This man is a psychologist."|1

I watch a lot of movies - DVD, features, and classics, you name it. The night I watched JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school, that it had stayed with her all of these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son), and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles. We all were. She, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it.|1
I was at a friends house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie , Eddie Monroe . I saw a lot of stuff about that movie , and I knew that this was a really good video and it would be very interesting for the next couple of weeks . I wanted to try the music and see how it was playing out on the screen . After watching the movie , and after I started listening to the music , I saw how I had to write lyrics for the song in my head so that it would rhyme . So I wrote it down and then put it on the album .|0
eXistenZ was a good film , at the first I was wondering what is going on , organic `` pods , and how they work. This was a very good film and it's easy to understand, especially when it's in the first few days, and in the last few days. It was the first thing I had to do when I watched it as a kid and I was just beginning to understand that things were happening at the end of the day. Now that I have this film, now I don't have time for it again.|0
"OK, so I gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months, i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool....little did i know that the only cool thing about this cliché-driven turd was precisely its trailer.At the cinema, i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself ""no way this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you've only seen 3 minutes"" while i rolled my eyes in shame."|1
I must admit , ashamed though I am , that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was born to me very young . You see , for my young age , no . I had to learn a whole bunch of different techniques so that my memory can remember . I could not have had a time for all of these . So, as time passed , . . . and . . . you see I got better and better . I have also learned more about myself . But , as you might guess , when . . . when . . . and .|0
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60's and 70's. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10, I give this film a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place.|1
"I watched this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor. In fact when he began Law and Order I was disappointed in him as it was not as powerful a role. Unfortunately the good roles do not pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It is both factual and entertaining. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved I purchased and read the book ""Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds"". And saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his insight."|1
This was a surprisingly very good movie , and an interesting idea .. However , it was just a little too far from what I'm used to for movies I like, I would have liked to have watched that in the future . Now if that is what happened I think I'd be much happier if I didn't have to watch this movie. I have never seen any movie that was made that way before the time of the films , but I've got enough money to pay for the movie itself now and I think I would be much happier in a movie made when it's done properly.|0
This is a difficult movie to watch, and would have been even more difficult had I known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street kid in Sao Paulo who is caught in a roundup triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. He is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist.

This movie was never intended as a big-budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it is certainly charming and engaging.Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon (that's certainly not new) who has a TV. However, his ratings are failing and he is worried about cancellation. So he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids--as he and his wife have none of their own. So, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing this almost immediately!|1
When the movie first started I thought cheesy. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics, I started liking it. The plot was different than anything I had ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not really. It shouldn't have been classied as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary. As it was, the creatures where only there for a short time. I can only assume this was for money reason.The good side was that the movie was very entertaining.|1
This is a very low budget film , set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of snow, fog and the mountains. I’ve been looking for a few things, but I can’t find anything that fits my taste and budget. I found a movie, I’ve seen many movies in the past, I don’t know if I like it or not, so I just wanted to review it. I like to review what you are reading and it will give the impression of how much you enjoy the movie.|0
Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play to him . I always liked his music and in fact he was a favorite among me. I would like to extend my thanks to the musicians who were there for his music and I hope to see him and his band again soon . Thanks again to all those that have been there for him. Thanks for all that have been there for him . Thanks for being here . . . I am very grateful for all the wonderful people that have made this journey possible . . .|0
I received this movie as a birthday gift because all of my friends know I 'm a big fan of their movies. I thought it was a great addition to my family, especially because my family loves the movies - and it's not because my father died. I thought I was being very lucky, but I'm sure the parents are as shocked as they were when I watched this. I know many parents who didn't like the movie because they thought it was a terrible idea. It just came out and it made a huge difference to them.|0
Good Film.I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale . £2.99 seems like a good deal . I was able to watch a lot of it, and did like the video, which was nice. I also liked the story, with some good music, but when I saw the movie it didn't seem like it would be as good as I wanted it to be. Not bad. And I also liked that there were enough people involved in the movie, so there was a huge amount of time that could be had for this.|0
Sure , most of the slasher films of the 1980 's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on , so it is very sad when you think about that . You have never made a slasher film, nor done anything like that . ive probably have a very hard time believing a film like these , if there really is one , that is all. . ive probably be the most hated and most hated movie in the world , it is the best , if any it was in the world, and if there is any movie, it's not the best . .|0

I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy, but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over, and the humor is adult enough that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts).|1
I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to give some context on the story and where it might have been on the screen. Also, it would have made it easier to do a more detailed analysis of its overall story. Thanks in advance for all of the help. In the last scene, it’s quite funny to look at a character in a movie like this and realize that if a scene was filmed for a single character it would only be on a single scene.|0
I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth's looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. Hayworth. She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is sex symbol par excellence).Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.But Rita drives this whole movie.|1
.... is where I 'm assuming this movie came from . I mean , I 've watched plenty of B movies and I wonder where it comes from, and it 's just that I've watched some of the best B movies and some of the best horror movies of the 1980s . I hope you enjoy. I hope you enjoy this one. I just watched another of the B movies on youtube, and I wonder where it comes from, and I don't remember . I just watch the movie in the bathroom and wonder if I got it right.|0
I remember when this show came out . It was originally advertised as a mini-series . At the end of it all we had about 30 episodes , we were about a week away from a show that started as a TV show . We went on the hiatus and had our first major show. The show took a long time to go on, but was about to end the season. We thought we were doing a good enough job at getting it over the hump . . . We would have to wait a little longer for the next series but had it ended before we got there .|0

In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime, i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this, and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good, not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product.|1
"I do n't even know where to start . I did not like it . It did not behave like a movie. In the end it is a movie. Why are the people like these people ? What do they know ? I don't understand, but the people like me are the same as them and I see it as a movie, but I don't think that is it . The person who said I should watch the film has said that it would be good if it had more of a ""real"" sound, but I don't know what the real sound is."|0
I recently saw Episodes 1-4, and now I can't wait for 5 & 6 to be available! (I've heard they are coming soon.) Commander's Log seems destined to become a cult hit among the university crowd and all others with a taste for quirky comedy. It's obvious that the budget was small, but the care taken in crafting the script is quite evident. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me appreciate the writing and the acting more. Bowlsby is a master of the put-down... I just wish I could remember all the best ones for later use on unsuspecting co-workers!|1
This woman is a terrible comedian . She ca n't crack a joke . She has no real character . I have never been one of those women , I never read a comment on this story before but I have known the women who make the comedy and I will be the next person to write it and it will have to go . I will write a story for you as a writer . And you will be the only one who knows all about it. And if you want to write it , I will be your producer .|0
"A moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century Japan, and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."" Really. A specialist in ""Oriental history"" who doesn't speak any Japanese, walks on tatami without removing her shoes, and is generally dumb as celery? Please. This looks like a student film: the sets are risible, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) close to wooden, the plot utterly arbitrary."|1
A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy' adventure through an uncharted cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years, and that twist seems to be taken from an X-File. I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt, but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up.|1
Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race , a killer begins to murder the rest of the class and the town's teachers. Her name is Laura Jones. It's a word that's often used to describe an individual, usually a woman who died in an accident. Laura's death was caused by an accidental collision with a road. The collision was caused by a heavy truck driven by her mother, who had been killed by her car. A police officer found her body on December 17 at a gas station.|0

If they do the punishment will be severe, and even better , they will be caught by surprise. If the system fails , and people are caught in prison for 5 years, then the punishment would be even more serious.|0

Talk about creepy . If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was a member of that creepy crew gets killed, look at the scene below and you’ll see her. She was also a member of the team when she was murdered. She was an agent of the FBI and they’ve got to keep her alive because if we kill her, they have to protect her. And they must keep her safe because if a killer gets out of control and kills her, then that killer is going to be safe.|0

Contains Major Spoilers , on the off chance you would actually care about the story line.OK , we have storms to look forward to next year. I am not suggesting you have it. But it sure does look like that. I think you should be looking into it in the summer time.

A middle aged man, Robert Jordan, set in his ways, takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress. Jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set. He has a rough go at first with the boys, especially so with Mike, an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated. Do things work out for Jordan and the scouts? Check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days.|1
`` Jefferson in Paris '' is a truly confounding film . It presents Thomas Jefferson ( Nick Nolte ) in the '80s' as an outcast on a tour to Paris, and then the Paris tour. It is said that the show 'doesn't come close to a '70s version' of the old Jefferson. It seems to have been a big hit in the early days of '70s film. As a '70s '50s movie, Thomas Jefferson was a big hit in its own right! A '60s '50s film was just as big a hit. Not only '70s, '70s, and '80s.|0

I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive.In its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. Even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film.|1
I cant put it any simpler than that , this is a terrible film . I 've worked in the theatre but never in the cinema , so i was not in the theatre and i didn't have the time or money to make it back to work. So my advice is that you get off to a great start on your career. After you graduate from your high school, apply to a job in the theatre or film. You can then move onto a more permanent occupation. I know some of you don't even have a career.|0
I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. The movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. It had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.In short, I'd much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again.|1
"First off, I'm a huge Bronson fan, have been since the late '70s. I watched every film he made on the big screen since ""Love and Bullets"", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, Hollywood-blockbuster star.I kept hoping that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good film in the '80s, but that never happened. And I don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio Cannon and hack director J. Lee Thompson for most of his latter films."|1
Oppenheimer was a GREAT series ( it was the first thing I saw Waterston in ) and it is too good to pass as an episode that takes place as the protagonist. I was looking forward to the one episode which I saw that had the same scene, but not that I could see how that was coming to light. It is too bad I would not have found a better show than Waterston. You are right, I will never have that one, I am sure. But, if I have been able to watch the first episode, I will know for sure I will.|0
Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of one person in the film, and more importantly as a character who has come to a very dark place in their life. We will take you step by step in making the film to create a beautiful, moving, and interesting film that will truly please the eyes of everyone who will see the film. For this installment of the film take a look at all of the different films that made their debut in the last few years of cinema.|0
This is the best work i have ever seen on television. The story is compelling--all the more so because it is true. The writers did their homework--the accuracy of events is well documented. The acting is great. This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production (either with PBS or in England) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS (at the time).|1
Was excited at the opening to hear part of `` Chevaliers De Sangreal '' but wanted more so I bought him. Now that we have a new player I'm not sure if there's more than just one on the team. I don't want to spoil the game, but I'd like to know. (I can't say much else here). If this isn't enough for you I'll have to talk to you on the other. I'll try to help you with this as I've already had a chance at this before and will try to do the same again.|0
What can I say?? This movie has it all...Romance, break-ups, rich kids, punks and preps. This is my all time favorite movie that I can recite line for line....I remember when it first came out, I was 14 and couldn't get in....so finally got to see it on cable... I was hooked! Wanted to move to California and be a Valley Girl.. (Hey, I even remember the song by Moon Zappa, do you?) Tried in vain for years to get the never produced soundtrack...now you can find it on rhino records....|1
A complete and utter waster of my precious two hours . The entire movie could have been made in less time than I'd expected . But I couldn't. The movie didn't even know it wasn't finished before it did, and there was no one around to judge it for me. Not that there was anything in it that I wanted to spend the whole day looking through. I just couldn't think of anything that would have surprised me. The second day after the movie ended, I called my mother and told her we were going to go see this movie.|0
"The recent documentary ""The Adventures of Errol Flynn"" is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart,Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword,thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in. If he hadn't been under contract to Warner Bros. he would've of been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion: the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he's a predator."|1
Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.If you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.If you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. You'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (I didn't, BTW), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim's.|1
"My parents may enjoy this show, but I fail to find the humor in it. What is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! It's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays. Blame that on shows like ""The Dating Game"" and ""The Newlywed Game"" bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. Sure, the series has its touching moments, still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series."|1
I had n't planned on leaving a review , but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie it really has all the potential for me to be disappointed. I can see why people do not like this as much but I have found my review to be really very positive. It is not just bad reviews for this film but it doesn't help the film. The acting and cinematography is great and the cinematography isn't as great as it could have been. You can find other reviews of this film for that same film on this web site or on the reviews section on this web site.|0
"Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to horn in on Chaplin's action after the studio head hollers, ""Next!"" Chaplin manages to walk in over Turpin, however. Charlie amusingly manages to botch jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he manages to get a big break, but will a star be born? There are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks. The initial scene involving slapstick from Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight."|1
When I finally got around to seeing this film recently, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance... yet another Hollywood CG/live-action rehash of an established cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable whatsoever. Designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts, poo-eating, and the size of Theodore's butt.This film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the Chipmunks. Even their characters I found were changed for the worse for this movie.|1
"Essentially plotless action film has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) pitted against two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s, Roundtree's small part is a far cry from his ""Shaft"" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughable turn in ""The Toolbox Murders"" (this man was a respected actor once, now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet)."|1
"No blood, no sex (though it oozes passion), no special effects, but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention. Great acting, great sets, great music, beautiful storyline. If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.The acting appears like real life, and elevates us to the level of awareness of ""Nanny"", to whom no-one is a lost cause, least of all the inhabitants of her own ""Halfway"" house."|1
When this show began it was fairly interesting: we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab-catching season. Soon after, however, it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman. Episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn' (this one happens way too often), 'someone is injured or sick', 'a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat', repeat.|1
I've discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic,it's also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn't got any farm and she can't cook.|1
Ho Hum . Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being , but bashing heads and trying to make sense of the situation.

It’s a process of learning which I’d like to go through on my journey, and it really is, but I have to keep it in mind for now to make sense of my thoughts.|0
While this is horribly dated, I MUST insist...PLEASE, NO REMAKE! Frankly, it just won't help, as there's nothing which could be added or changed, contemporarily, to make this cinematically better.The novel upon which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. Most of King's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. I'm not sure why this is, but when you view this work, if you view it, you are likely to see just what I mean.|1
All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced . That is their main justification to claim that they make the movie in their movies . In the past I did have a look at this video . The main thing is they want to make it in a film . It has all the main flaws that they put out and they want to make it in a film ! But they do it in a movie . You don't even know when you made the movie , you just have to look at the video . You see the movie .|0

OK , Number one-this `` film '' is a `` 90 's '' version of a crappy show from the 1990's. He has been on a regular and regular basis in Hollywood since 1979, for a few years at that. He's been cast as an actress since 1991 and has worked with many of the most famous actresses in Hollywood and the West Coast, including Jennifer Lopez, Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Aniston. There are some other great actresses of the era, too, especially Jennifer Lopez, who have also worked in Hollywood.|0
I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget.|1
A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict. The movie is one that will hit much too close to home to those who were involved in the drug culture and have knowledge of what being(or being around) a heroin addict really is. Good movie, which will never truly be outdated. Excellent performances by all involved and the minimalist set is Preminger's way of showing how bleak a JUNKIE'S world can become. Worth a look--an education of sorts. The golden arm is a worried look at the truth of the underground life of pain a junkie lives in.|1
"I gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.I went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of African musical - since people break into song every few minutes.None of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a ""tune.

This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been out on the water since I was 13, so I got a lot of the humor as well as recognizing a lot of the near-land scenery (the movie, although taking place in and around Virginia, was filmed around the San Francisco Bay), most notably the mothball fleet just east of the Benicia Bridge where Kelsey Grammar's character was first introduced to the USS Stingray, and the piers of San Francisco at the very end of the movie (including a boat that I've worked on).|1
"It seems like an exciting prospect, a modern-dress ""Othello"" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so frighteningly good in ""Shallow Grave"" and (especially) ""Jude,"" and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and introspection to his pivotal role on ""Oz."" One would think them both natural Shakespeareans, but both performers misfire: Walker's Othello is a fairly cookie-cutter take on the part, with a whispery delivery that doesn't make much of an impact; and Eccleston hams it up appallingly as Iago, winking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role."|1

I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who went off the air, and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out there was going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it going to live up to the expectations I had carried around since I was little? Would they screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck?|1
I was duped as well . Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell did I expect? As I said before, I was trying to find out why they had the beer. After all, why did they say there was no beer in the tap? It was obvious why they said Pirahnas. Why would they, when they were trying to get the beer, say that there was no beer inside their beer, and why would they let that beer out? How was that possible? It’s the same thing that I’m told is true!|0
Comparisons to the original series are inevitable. It's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960's due to mistreatment on the part of the producers, and MacNee probably regretted this as much as any fan - there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was OK as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the Rigg episodes - only the Rigg/Macnee chemistry was lacking. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf - a declining Macnee, an annoying Purdey, and a who the hell is this guy Gambit.|1
`` Rouge '' is part of a trilogy , but very much stands on its own . It is n't an absolute masterpiece , but it works as hoped . It is as much a master as the rest of the book of '' Rouge''. If it were not for that book of '' Rouge''. It's got a very good plot , and so far as I can tell you, '' Rouge'' is one of '' Rouge''. But it's been around for only three years, and nothing new ever has made it out.|0
I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and gets wacky, it gets really wacky. Just one funny scene after another. My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A, which was a treat.|1
I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production. A toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever cache Vincent Price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny.|1
'The Shining' has wit, visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. 'Ausentes,' however, has none of these things; although it does borrow from its classic forebear; to wit, a man hacking through a door and a woman running around shrieking while clutching a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, 'Ausentes' is a work which resonates with a singular lack of genius. It is magnificently, comically awful; it makes the Spice Girls movie look like a work of vital art.|1
I ran across this movie on a local TV channel last night . Frankly , I have never heard about it, I thought it was a real movie but it never came out! I also thought that some of you might know about it , but I was going to go to a friend's party , which we had planned for the weekend, but we never got together again because of that. But the thing about it was that the movie was really interesting . First I saw it, but I was surprised to see that it wasn't very long, not a lot of the movie was that long.|0
"Well every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.Well while I was watching this movie I remembered watching ""Amilie"". Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are both based on a same plot line. But both of them are Perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.Red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. And I am still thinking about it.The story is great and the ending is a bit funny."|1
This is a must-see movie . You will laugh , you will cry , and when it 's over you will find that it is not over. You will cry , and when you are happy, you will find you will be happy. I am so sick of my wife's constant screaming. I am so sick of her. I am sick of the constant screaming that has caused me to cry. This movie is so much more than I can bear to watch. I am so tired of what I do. I want to cry a lot and get better.|0
Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party , in part because they’ve made the right-wing rhetoric. As a member of an anti-capitalist faction, he doesn’t always win, and sometimes has to be replaced by a party member, even as he fights back against the same people he was before his party. But if Cvetic wasn’t a Marxist-Leninist in the party, he would probably get the same treatment from other communists as he got with his communist party comrades. “Like all communists,” wrote one insider who ran Cvetic.|0
I was lucky enough to have seen this film at it 's Seattle Film Fest screening , and was blown away when it was on the front cover. This is one of the best film screening in Seattle, it is not only one of the best film screenings at the year. It was the largest screen in the entire year, and I was even more amazed at the film's size when I saw it with a camera. The film is just a little smaller than I had expected , it was so small when the camera was attached.|0
"Sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced.Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait.John Carl Buechler, my least favorite B-movie guy, did the lousymakeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken, of ""TheWitches of Eastwick"" and the Addams family movies."|1
One of the better movies to come out of the 1980's, this based-on-fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend, leaves her naked body on a river bank, and brags about it later to his friends. What is just as bad is their inability to FEEL anything about it.Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority, who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget.|1
"The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief ( the Indian ) by an Winnipeg city officer ( a police officer or an Indian )

Why, you might ask, do you want to know. Because it’s something that’s very rare, and one of Canada’s highest and best known laws is a very strict one. So, when it comes to the most common cases of the kind of crime you’re seeing in the public realm of this country, it’s almost always a one way street, and you just might get caught in the crosshairs of a fight or two."|0
I knew it was going to be awful but not this awful! !, as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, not a damn thing happens!. All the characters are dull, and the story is stupid and incredibly boring!,plus The ending is especially lame!. The only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, however he is wasted here, and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever!, plus i cheered out loud when the movie was over!.|1
this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward...granted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be, but i thought this was amazingly well-acted, and a powerful creation, if lacking a little subtlety in exectution. i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play, it creates an inharmonious eeriness that works well with this flick. i am also a great fan of alan rickman, so that might be my bias.|1
Too much stock footage ( almost one third of this 53 minute film ) really slows this one down . I was also thinking about what you could do in real life . I have watched a few movies with him and I have thought about this film again, I think he’s in real life . This was my first time watching him , I can say he was very funny . This was also an interesting idea , I was thinking he could use that as inspiration for how to write this film . I would love to know what he was up to.|0
I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining ( which is n't it), which was released a month before this movie. The only difference of that film was that if you were to do it before that film, you'd get a 2 star rating. You wouldn't see it if you don't have money to buy a movie from a theater. But you do. So it seems like most people who want a great deal on their rental movie will do it and get it for the price it will be given.|0
In a world full of films -- like `` You Got Served '' -- that blow your mind with its focus on the first moments of your story, you have one thing going for you: A movie with a lot to do. That's because we, as fans of the film, we get to see a movie of some sort and we have to watch it, because it's a movie that can get you hooked on the story, which, in many instances, is more of a journey than a film.|0
"Korine's established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive image-maker. The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one in particular I've yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down). The opening images of this film, of Michael Jackson lookalike (Diego Luna) riding a small motorbike round a track, is strangely compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison's ""Mister Lonely"" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow-motion."|1
"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's supposed to be a remake or update of ""The One-armed Swordsman"", by Chang Cheh. The ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching. The script tries desperately hard to seem serious, but is full of cliches like, ""And I knew then that nothing would ever be the same again..."" or ""If only I'd known what a heavy price I would have to pay."" Ugh! And who is that girl who plays Sing?"|1
I 'd liked the Takashi Miike films I 'd seen so far , but I found this pretty disappointing . . . but it 's just the same . . . . I 've only seen one and it was a great film . . . . but when I look at the other two you 'd see nothing . . . . and that's not good . . . . I just didn't get the impression that the other is a good movie . . . . it's just a great movie . . . . I 'm not a huge fan of the Takashi Miike films I 've seen so far .|0
Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play . A murder has been committed and a bunch of people are injured and have been put to the crime scene . There's a large group of suspects, but nobody knows who or what they are , so we'll start with you . We have a lot of things to discuss now . The main thing we have at this point is how to remove people from the premises , how to stop people entering the building, and how to put people back to their rooms .|0
Visually , this film is interesting . Light is literally thrown in a way , together with cinematography and an atmospheric atmosphere . There is also a sense that it looks a little too much like a feature film , with the use of the camera and of the soundtrack. In short , it doesn’t quite seem like there is anything to be said. The film is actually pretty well paced . It is just the kind of movie that will leave a lasting impression when you view the action scenes in the video game.|0
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?|1
I 've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious , and I 've been a fan of him ever since . He's always got my attention , and whenever he makes an appearance at my show I 've seen him do so , not as I would if I hadn't seen him . . . I've seen him act like a cartoon character , but I never see him do anything like that. . . . I don't care if he 'll do his job , or not .|0
DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character, although way hotter than most low budget starlets, is a pretty standard low budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted. Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I ain't trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick.|1
"If I had to pick the most depressing movie , try to be suspenseful I 've seen it 'd be a great thriller. I 'll watch more films and I 'll like them more. Anyway I 'm not surprised that most of their movies are very suspenseful

If I could pick the most depressing movies I'd probably choose this one :D And I think I could watch more films and I'd like it more. That's pretty much what I'm looking for when I say it's going to be interesting to watch. But I've never seen any films of the kind I'm expecting."|0
This is a romantic , albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites . It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was a great movie at that time . If you have been following my blog for a short time you would be amazed. So, if you would like more information, check out these reviews. This movie is great. The soundtrack was pretty good, so you would expect it to be even better than that. It is a very good movie, but even better, because I really like the story.|0
Being a wrestling fan , movies about wrestling generally suck ( Backyard Dogs , Bodyslam , Jesse Ventura story ) , and there's always some controversy on whether we should just leave out the main characters ( I won't go into that part but I do think I don't know yet) but if you're trying to get rid of them then the main issue is there's always something about wrestling that doesn't make you think about it. For example, what do the characters in the video above have in common with the people who watch them on TV or movies?|0
Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident `` The Wind and the Lion '' is a very good one. '' But I have to go back to the way you said you did it.'' I've been thinking about what I was going to say, and the fact that you had to change a thing or two, and that's what I wanted to try to do. I mean, I think that would be great. I can't really say I wanted to say that. But I would rather we make a good deal of difference, or we make a good deal about it.|0
"I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a Saturday night. Well, there's not one ounce of ""cool"" in this ridiculous movie. The score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than ""boy meets girl,"" the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes."|1
Not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is wonderful in this movie. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider who will make you crack up with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell who plays Buckman. Lauren Holly plays probably the more serious character in the cast as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this movie, playing probably the most serious character in the movie. The actor i liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the movie is hilarious.Plot is a little uneven, about Lt.|1
Yet again , director J. Lee Thompson unites with actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick . . . and it's not even the most violent movie in decades, it's certainly not a bad film. And if you're ever going to watch it, it's the one I'm about to watch, this is one film you can't get away with, but you will if you watch the movie right now and it's not a good film , it would be no fun to watch. . . You have to watch what you want to watch .|0
"The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript of the celebrated poem ""The Death of One"" and many other important writings by the artists of the day. This was an epochal and perhaps the most famous work on the theme of death, and certainly the most ambitious in its treatment of art history, since it gave the world's first photographic memory its first image of the body and its earliest photographic picturesque images. The text is of the most elaborate, with many lines of poetry."|0
The movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age . Clayburgh's father, the man that loves the boy in a way he hasn't seen before, plays a role in his life. Though he was in love with the little girl and his father, the father never seems to understand the importance of the girl and the man in her life. And even though he knows his father's relationship with the boy is between himself and the girl, Clayburgh believes the man will love her more.|0
Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever heard and that was written about by a very talented film-maker who was just starting out as a comedy writer, director and writer. You may not agree that this is a funny, funny, hilarious comedy, but you may agree that this is not funny but funny. In this way you get to see what is going on, and that is that. That's what the comedy looks like. That's a laugh.|0
A good movie for horse enthusiasts and most others . It 's a horse racing movie , and it 's also a horse tour film , which makes a huge difference if one wants a horse to be seen on the world wide web . I've watched the first two films , and they both make a big difference in the performance of a horse . As you can see in this article , horse tours and horse tour films also have a big effect on performance to horse racing , and there will always be a good level of horse touring on the web , and you will always see horse tours on the web .|0
Once again, I've been duped by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie. I actually put my shoes on, got in my car, burned expensive gasoline and drove to the nearest rental place AFTER reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing. I'm telling you, this one's not worth the minuscule kilo-calories spent on lifting one's index finger to switch channels on a TV remote. I even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell-tale signs of a pedigree dog-pile.|1
To even say that this film is Sebastien's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man. Sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not amusing at best, yet highly popular host on french television. If watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally constituted human being, his first (ans lets hope only) film proved to be even worst. Sebastien's apology of rape (the victim fall in love with her aggressor) is not only misplaced but plainly unacceptable.|1
If you like your films to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your films with a guy you can root for, and relate to, if you like your films in black and white, you gotta see this film! Watch it from start to finish, because you don't want to miss a beat. It is sometimes slow, and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen, then when the plot begins to unfold, you will be on the edge of your seat! I know I was!|1
I watched this movie with big expectations . The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be the most expensive film ever produced, and we did our best. There are many things that are difficult to do without a budget. I think the most important thing was to make a film that was fun to watch if it didn't have something to do with what the filmmakers said it could. That's not always the case when I work. I think if I was to have a budget that was very good, I would have a movie that would have that budget.|0
I 've lost count of the times I have seen this movie , but I love it and find it to be so great and entertaining. It's also a terrific and enjoyable movie to watch as I'm not very much into video games. It had a great ending and the cinematography was just perfect. I was happy with the score and I'm sure it will be a favourite with other moviegoers! I've always liked this movie so well, I was very excited to read it and had the opportunity to see some of it at the cinema.|0
This movie is Hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another? GIANT cgi versions of these beasts which battle! However I do require one of the guns used in the movie. Because apparently they are using cheats. Count the amount of shots they use before having to...oh wait that's right they never have to reload. Regardless count the shots... it's hilarious.The sound effects used in the movie for the Komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant. Oh and did I forget to mention that apparently these GIANT Komodo dragons are stealthy as hell?|1
"The first season told pretty much how all elements of the Marine Corps would operate (i.e. ground, air, helicopters and jets) as a team. That's the season I give the high rating to! (True, there are still a lot of ""liberties"" taken in season 1, but the stories were more believable. )The subsequent seasons were a gawd-awful attempt of Melrose Place meets Top Gun! I was a Marine stationed at Miramar at the time and I remember them shooting the show around the San Diego area."|1
"Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last movie that Julius Harris had a role in. I have not seen all of his movies, but Julius Harris was in many good movies, and I remember him best from ""Live and Let Die"" where he played Tee-Hee and which was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo persona!"|1
I 'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when I saw this movie in a movie theatre it was absolutely amazing - it was real. As I understand, when animators first come to the cinema it's because of them. But now I understand that. The animators who come and work with the actors at the cinema are actually the animators of the cinema, so what the actors are for doing the movies for - I mean to me it's like the actors are in the movies themselves and I was never a kid. They're like kids.|0
"Incredibly, ""Vampire Assassin"" is significantly worse than such atrocities as ""Tequila Body Shots"" and ""Zombie Nation"" - and those movies are TERRIBLE. Writer/director/star Ron Hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I have ever seen in a movie. Rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. The terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes."|1
Underwoods goofy story about a young man ( Arquette ) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra ( Eddie Murphy ) because he's got nothing to lose. I thought it was a bit funny, but it was actually funny because it's just a couple of quotes in a joke. I just don't like jokes, so when I watched the episode, I saw that it was one of those things, especially when the scene was the only one of the two jokes that were funny. It was funny and funny was what it said.|0
I saw this version about a decade ago, and have been looking for it ever since. I just recently found an original VHS version, and purchased it for $125.00. Sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it as one of the best the Broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't even think twice.Why, it's just a little over paying for a Broadway ticket today. I really hope they re-release this in DVD form soon. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by all!|1
Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible.|1
It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids On Fire and Kidnapped. I’m not saying that Clark is the greatest or the worst of the two films (although I am pretty sure that’s a big reason why it was released), I just think that there was a time in the cinema when Clark would have used to be so much fun. When I was watching the film, I was very interested in the movie itself, so what I saw was one of its very good times, and Clark was so very much fun.|0
I watched this movie on TCM last night , all excited expectation , having last seen it ( twice ) . I also saw the same thing . I was watching the same movie and watched it again on DVD and also watched it with the same expectation . So I guess I was looking a bit ahead . But it was a bit strange. I had never seen these movies before I saw them in movies . They were shown in movies . I also watched the same movie a second time last night and then watched it again . 1. It's a comedy-drama and there are some really nice scenes .|0
"The material is poor .... the script 's dreadful .... the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what happened ..... If you were reading this article you'd probably think that I have no idea about this and you're probably a bit more specific than me. I'd be shocked that it's even possible to see how you'd make that case if you knew about it. I read that in the book ""Why Do People Give Up Badly? "", but if you think that's a good point you're being a little naive."|0
Assy McGee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a walking buttocks.The cheap, low-brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire. That is not to say that Assy is devoid of fart jokes, just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs, not groans and eye-rolls. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor used throughout. The sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme.|1
This is a forgotten classic of a film , and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from it for `` Gummo ». Well, it's pretty much the same, so I guess I'll leave it there when I get it ready. I had some fun doing that too, and I thought it would be fun to make it for a movie. This was not one of my favorite movies I watched in the 70's. Not only did I enjoy it, but it also made me feel more relaxed and aware of everything that I saw.|0
I must admit that I did n't get around to seeing this movie in the theater . As it was a prelude to next week's movie, he didn't even have to watch it in person . As for the rest of his character, what we've seen is probably pretty awesome . I really like how they get to play their characters . I feel that there are a few characters out there that can be made more fun and enjoyable . If you read this series and watch a few of them , it's really really worth the time .|0
The box to this movie totally misrepresents itself . The cover shows a view of legs & panties in a dark room. It's not a cover though. It's not like they're trying to hide it too, because there's not the slightest evidence that they're really concealing it, and they're going to be using it for a cover. They don't hide it. It's a cover. This isn't like it's a movie. It's a cover, and you have to find it. They're doing that.|0
This film is absolute cinematic genius . It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance which is the most captivating one of the series to date (it was made for the first time, in 1998 , for which you can read an interview ) but the whole thing seems to have been created for the benefit of everyone , and they’re very much doing an amazing thing, this is why they’re the best director in history, you know it is. For the rest of us this is one of the biggest things that you could do as a director.|0
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better. Then, when it ends, you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back. Ice-T did his bad guy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. The pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits.|1
I did n't know what to expect from this hugely popular ( and hilarious ) Swedish comedy & satire team. This blog was inspired by my personal experience with satire. It’s a great place to start. And if you like what you see on the website, and are looking for an easy way to make a little money, why not consider this blog too? I have a website for this purpose, for a lot more than I’ve posted here, but I’m hoping that you can consider it as a starting place to begin your satire research.|0
This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall . In many ways , this is a good thing! It has the potential to become a truly great musical. It was a great time , I have enjoyed every musical that has been done by this company! I am always so surprised by music that has been produced by an individual, but I also know that you should never forget that music is an expression of who you truly are as it is the heart of an individual, regardless of what your personal goals may be.|0
I recently got the movie and all I can say it is a good movie . There 's a lot of good stuff to come out, so this is the one to remember, in a movie. This was my first time doing this, I loved the movie it's about a guy with a little bit of money making a lot more than a couple of ordinary people. But for the love of god let's start with that. When you go down to the library, you'll have to go to any place that has a screen.|0
I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies especially considering it was recommended. Must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made it worst in that it tried so hard to be clever that it made me squirm to watch it.The concept of the movie is comparable to audition week on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew this movie didn't have bad actors. So how funny would it be to have good singers try to convince they shouldn't get anywhere near an American Idol tryout?|1
I can only say this : ee03128 from Portugal , I could n't say it better . The worst movie in any film , has been no better then 'e03128 from all the countries . It is a very bad movie but still a bad movie and the worst movie of all . It's so sad when a movie has bad movie but it has a good movie and it's good movie of the real world . If you look at other film , there are a few that is bad , but if you look at other movies, it's good , it's bad but it's not a bad movie .|0
Sappy.I liked how they went to the `` Haaavaad baaa '' to quote books at each other to impress the readers. I liked that as well. I guess I had to think about some other things in order to come up with the best book I would recommend to people who would really like to hear what you guys think of the book. I think if you look at the website and your book you can see how many links you have to the website. If you are going to see the link to the page you can see it on your browser.|0
From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence . Showing Moses as a murderer . People who do not understand how the world should be is called a criminal . He who loves to see his father's face . God's love is what it is all about . God's love for everyone . God's love for every human being . God is a person . We have to remember that we are humans . We have to remember that there is no perfect God . The only God is a human who is a human . God is human . God is an entity .|0
If this film had been directed by DW Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, it would be recognized for what it is: a cinematic masterpiece, told with depth and subtlety and passion, a film with no equal in the visual realm. It is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation. And of course, what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick-and-jane tale like 99% of hollywood output. Its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions.|1
"This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you find this at a garage sale, LEAVE IT THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and yet HATE THIS MOVIE... Although ashamed, I do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this at all. They play it up to be ""A Sandra Bullock Movie"". She only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. Well everyone has to start somewhere..."|1
Now I 'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so much so I'm thinking I need to spend some time to create animations like that for all the other games I've done recently. What I'm trying to do is to make a list of some of the many games that make my life easier. The first few games I did, they all have the same gameplay and I've tried every one I know to create them. There's a lot of good ones out there I just couldn't get through.|0
The series does not start as it means to go on. Although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. The first ever episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and Marina Sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. Seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually.|1
Lt. Claude ( Claudio Cassinelli ) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by the British. During the week that he had been shot by the Americans, he was held in a hut at the shore. He remained there for several days and returned to his cell. On that day his wife died. Later in his life, he was imprisoned for a third time by the Americans with his wife and sister. He spent a year at sea, spent time in jail, and spent the next years in exile.|0
OK, I've now seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as I worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and I have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. He wasn't Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. But the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. That's the case here.|1

"I wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. Frankie Muniz of ""Malcom in the Middle"" fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yea the film does work as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways."|1
This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. The movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated.|1
I know it's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD, particularly from the 80's but please seek out the original version of the Vanishing - title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws up bigtime, particularly at the finale.I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and particularly Jeff Bridges, but this is just so so lame compared with the original. What where they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily into the arms of Brad Pitt in the finale?|1
My website ( www.theflickguy.org ) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time . Here is an excerpt from its website, where you can download and watch it as you wish. I had a look at the movie at the same time as you, but when I started looking at the movies I was not so thrilled. I could tell that the plot was much simpler than I had pictured it , but I was also not quite convinced that I was in a good frame of mind when watching the movie. I started thinking about this movie and when I said that I didn't like it.|0
Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death command the dialectics of Life. By the end of 19th century in a remote Japanese village a young man and a married woman, older than he, fall in love with each other and decide to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy that freedom since Remorse begins to haunt them beginning as usual at the time by the weakest member of the couple, the woman of course. Henceforth in an atmosphere where dream (nightmare) mixes up with reality the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman but then also to the man.|1
I have seen several Yul Brynner films -- yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions. Yul Brynner didn't just take the time to do this movie, he did it with his eyes on the world. He said that he had a vision, a sense of humor and a sense of adventure. We don't have to be the characters in this movie, you just can't just jump right in. That's how Brynner did. You have to see this movie in the best possible way and you can see the way it is.|0
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good, they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp, Ms.|1

I am not sure who recommended Surveillance to me , but I think I have an idea : one of my colleagues recommended it to me but he didn't get the review, and I had never been there before so I didn't know much about it. I was told about it by a member of his family, and they thought the reviewer was bad, and when I went back to the website, I saw he was really good, and they said the review was fine. That was my reaction: the review didn't come, but I think it is worth a look.|0
Rating : 8 out of 10 . Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.Tennis star Guy Haines ( Farley Granger ) meets the actress Amy Schumer ( Glyn Hughes ) who was in the process of working on her own film in the early ’90s, her first attempt at a documentary, but the actress has just completed her third film, “What’s in Your Head“.

11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on IMDb . There is a lot of discussion in the past few days that this film is very well made. However, that is only one aspect and it is not all that I would have liked. It is definitely a film about a young girl who was brought to this country and has her family and friends here. It is all about a young girl with a big life experience. I really don't have much time here but if anyone wants to know the full truth then let's make sure to check out this video.|0
This was a disgrace to the game FarCry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare. Besides the bad acting the visual effects, stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop. The movie is not worth watching at all. The funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss Jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs. Guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time. I hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday.|1

As a big Dostoyevsky fan, I had always been disappointed with Hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point, Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions, but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When given an intelligent script to work with, he suddenly came alive and was as noble, sexy, and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri.|1
"I was hoping to like this movie, to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.Unfortunately, I found myself dozing over and over again. Judy Davis gave a fine performance, but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. The plot was full of ""twists"" that were just plain silly, and as so often happens in movies of this type, nobody acted the way a real human being would act."|1
Kazuo Komizu strikes again with `` Entrails of a Beautiful Woman '' , the sequel to `` Entrails of a Beautiful Woman''.

He also became a fan of`` Entrails of a Beautiful Woman'' in `` Entrasins of a Beautiful Woman''''. This article was first published on October 31, 2018, at 10:13 PM on YouTube.|0
"I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the hardest working lead actress of the 30's and 40's although few of her movie roles are memorable. Today she is remembered most for the TV show ""The Big Valley"". Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence.And so it was for ""Christmas in Connecticut"" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and isn't even really about Christmas."|1
River's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one. Having viewed it many years ago I truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something. Perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie. Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film. Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools.|1
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing, but I just found it annoying. It's been a while since I've seen it (and hopefully I won't find out all my memories are wrong and I'm unjustly condemning this movie), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society, and that this somehow caused their horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and think it's unfair both to homosexuals and to Bobby Franks, the real victim of the story.|1
This is a pretty obscure , dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades . It is really stupid and just looks like someone is trying to rip the movie apart. If they're actually trying to kill someone then he just has to make it look worse . . . it also makes you think this movie is an attempt to kill a guy , but he just has to fight for what he is trying to do. If this movie made you think you would be able to kill a guy then he will do it . . .|0
"Some describe CALIGULIA as `` the '' most controversial film of its era . While this is debatable , it is generally true .

"As an ex (nuclear) submarine officer I must admit this is my favorite submarine movie (even exceeding Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the movie. OK - not realistic - but it is a comedy - and has all of the ""inside jokes"" from the submarine force. A great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the ""Orlando"" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely ""DBF"" by the way = that means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines in order to post this - jees is the Admiral in charge here?"|1
"Genius or utter madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it on the level of a self-aware ""cop-movie parody"", and I sincerely hope that was the intention as I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I think not!"|1

Like the above poster , I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha ... This is how it looks . It has a lot of the same features that I just said, but it's also quite different . I will be playing it later , I hope it helps you to play it . The other poster is also very similar. I have played it since the beginning but it was just too early for me as I haven't had the chance to really play it because it has been in my head for the past 2 years but I do love it in a good way.|0
I saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie . The way Michael Oliver who now plays Michael Oliver is so awful that it really makes me weep . Michael Oliver is an excellent actor. He is not an expert at directing. He does a great job of convincing his actors to do the work. However, the acting is a little too small. He is not particularly talented at the job. He is not especially talented in directing. The only problem with his directing skills is that it is really not good enough.|0
I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. The chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. Not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.We did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but I wondered why.I don't admit to ever being a 'chipmunks' fan, but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy handed view of 'success too young spoils'.|1
This is an interesting , hard to find movie from the early 70 's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a guy who works with the military. I haven't heard anything from it, but the script seems to have gotten a little too long and the ending made me suspicious. While I'm in love with this story, I'd like to know what happened in it before the ending. I think that this would be the first film that comes out and I'll be watching it when I finish reading the synopsis. If it was me I'd probably just watch it.|0
"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a ""space"" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin."|1
"This one was truly awful. Watching with fascinated horror, I kept on asking ""why have they done this?"" That is, taken all the scenarios out of ""The Day after Tomorrow"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Twister"" and remixing them in a three-hour miniseries, directed by long-time junk TV director Dick Lowry, with every disaster movie cliché known to man and not an ounce of real suspense. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians and location filming was done in Canada, Winnepeg doubling for Chicago, so no doubt tax breaks had something to do with it."|1
"I do n't know what it is exactly , but the film is happily sitting on my shelf , with no fuss in it . so I'll do a quick scan, and see what they have there , and what they don't have. And I'll post an update as soon as I have a good idea. What is it exactly , though its just not a good movie

You should not buy it at all . The original movie is the worst one . If you think that's because the original movie was terrible , you'll have to buy that movie ."|0
This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading. The movie is quite gory, well-acted and beautifully shot. The special-effects are top-notch and seem to be ahead of their time, until you realize this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest. It is a unique take on the Dr. Moreau story, and one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking, but the film doesn't ever really fall apart.|1
"This is one of the best episodes from the entire X-Files series, creepy beyond words. The tension and suspense in this episode is very well executed, in its entire 45 minutes it managed to be almost as scary as an entire movie. This episode joins the ranks of best episodes with such greats as ""Home"", ""Humbug"" ""Bad Blood"" and ""Milagro"" for being the best in their respective season.Mulder and Scully's growing relationship is put to the test in this episode: Can they really trust each other?"|1
2005 was one of the best year for movies . We had so many wonderful movies , like Batman Begins, The Hunger Games, The New Avengers , The Good Earth, etc . And we had all these wonderful movies as a result, which I think is a lot of fun for us. The best years for movies was 2010 and it's so good. I've heard a lot about how the movies have changed, but I'm not sure that there is any change in them all. There are many movies we haven't watched, and many movies where we haven't watched them all.|0
"What a wonderful film , filled with eccentric , unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast of actors , writers , directors and technicians . . . the perfect blend of cinema , photography , visual art and a good soundtrack , which are sure to keep me entertained for years to come .

I’m not quite sure what is it I’ve read on this blog before :

What is the difference between film and story telling ? It can be both, or it can be both."|0
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my all-time faves! It's a classic - the intriguing plot, great characters, suspense and shocking twist ending (all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous Monterey/Big Sur coast) never get old. Roy Thinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds. The acting is great and believable; viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband, disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger (Thinnes as Brant).|1
I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X . Luckily , my hopes have came true . You are in luck, you are one of the original characters. If you haven't seen it yet then do. I will post it later in the day. If I do, I want to see it right here in the post. This will be my third post so far so I will do it in the meantime and hope that I can do it right now. I don't know the details yet, but you can find out.|0
"I can't remember the series, I believe it may have been ""American Masters"", but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people have some knowledge of the development of the A bomb, and those that have little, or none, probably think it is a pretty dry subject. Anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way. You get to know the turmoil in Oppenhemiers mind, and how the development changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he became, and why."|1
OK, I read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment'), and I have to admit that I can identify with his position.Micheal, I hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other, better things. I've seen this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it.|1
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the West and war was often more poignant (should I say more realistic ? ).This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of Mr K's era. It also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990's with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actors.This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : war.|1
This is probably the only film I 've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are positive. And IMDb's reviews of both shows are generally positive -- even though they are not at all comparable, IMDb is in my opinion a bad IMDb review. IMDb is also often negative on the review, but IMDb's review of it is generally very negative. (I have to admit that I don't think I personally agree with both films -- I just feel that IMDb does. IMDb is generally not a good IMDb.)|0
"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment."|1
JURASSIC PARK III *___ Adventure Sam Nell (The Dish), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ(a Leoni (Family Man)A better title would be: ESCAPE FROM THE ISLAND OF REALLY MEAN DINOSAURS. But then no one would need to see the film. In this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.ACCESS HOLLYWOOD reports JP3 began filming without a completed script. That explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects.|1
Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place.|1
Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. I watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. Was I watching the same film? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps' past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no-one was affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there.|1
i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas, and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man, i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb, even with that slightly strained welsh accent,and it is a sad tale that they tell.|1
"- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** -Not presenting itself as yet another remake of ""The Interview"", Five Fingers actually is. Alas, besides maybe the hardship of physical torture, it never adds anything to it's predecessor's accomplishment in terms of suspense, plot or performances. In fact, Five Fingers never gets anywhere near its level. What I found to be in particular painful to watch wasn't the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) acted out his ordeal."|1
"Journalist Bob Woodward's blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor John Belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie, a nebulous ""fantasy"" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on ""The Shield"") is put in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, taking a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating those ""Saturday Night Live"" skits which are now part of TV history. It's like watching someone try to out-Lucy Lucille Ball--it can't be done."|1
A woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides . Then again , are these really the ones we're talking about, not the ones that don't seem to have anything in common with normal people. We don't have a lot of answers, so let's just hope that the answers don't involve suicide as we've been suggesting for years. But let's say that's what it's all been. 1/ I don't have any proof, so I'll just have to give you some hints.|0
"SPOILER WARNINGWe've all heard the ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd ( Frankie Muniz from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an English essay, but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes Jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school."|1
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? There's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!|1
( Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important you could n't have figured out yourselves ) Yeah , it's pretty much what he did in the first place. He did what he wanted and he got what he needed. He did what you'd expect. I mean he had a lot of things that you'd expect from the first person of his kind to do, just like everyone. But that was the first and only time in my life that I actually did get to do what he was trying to do, so I think that was pretty significant in what he did.|0
"Countenance! Antoine Monot, in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith's Silent Bob, keeps asking for it, but writer/director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, understated old-school bard of ""There's something about Mary"" fame, would grace any small-town dropout story. In visual allure, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his tan six-series BMW two-door, wearing aviator shades, going nowhere."|1
This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good film in the low budget category. I assumed this movie would be good also, but boy was I wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive other than they both take place on submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases, totally preposterous.This movie will not hold most people's attention. (I remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud.|1
This is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. It was the first I had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I had ever seen on film.Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the most evil characters I've ever seen on film, and I've viewed thousands. He was so sadistic that I would never watch this movie again, nor would I recommend it.|1
I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline Batman's either)A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection.If you've seen the Demolitionist then get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It even stars the same guy in both movies)If you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance.|1
Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible for a number of reasons:No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tensionIn a word - no.Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. Who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.Once again: Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible.No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tensionIn a word - no.Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. Who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.|1
Harmony Korine. I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.I know that there were big questions raised in this movie like, who are we really, what are we here for, is there really a God. All great questions, But I really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy. I'm all for real life being portrayed but come on.|1
There are a whole lot of movies, primarily from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. I have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time. It is the prime example of how in the 80s, ANY movie could get released.Our killers name is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?)|1
"This movie was definitely on the boring side. The acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a BLATANT RIPOFF of Paul Simon's ""You Can Call Me Al"" - except that they don't acknowledge it at all. Isn't there something a little hypocritical there? The scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite."|1
"The MTV sci-fi animated series ""Æon Flux"" is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all."|1
"If you Listen to Ween (The Pod, God/Satan), then you know what's going on with ""Split"" I found that watching the film under the influence of LSD helped to deal with Audio/Video tracers from fantastic editing job. The plot was only important from second to second. The acid helped to interact with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. Don't bother writing about something out of your comprehension's reach...There just isn't enough of these great independent attempts at expression at it's most raw , amateur level."|1
This movie is a haunting telling of the life of the author and poet , Mishima . It jumps around the world by the name of 'Mizam' , which means 'mythical mythological' as in , 'the story' or , 'mystery of the supernatural'. In Mishima's world, he's a very popular figure. In some ways he's become famous, but in other ways he's still in awe and fascination, and as such in his own time. As Mishima said , it wasn't quite as much of a problem to learn about what it is to be a poet , as he was learning.|0
The best so-bad-it's-good movie ever made. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether dealing with day to day life or pimping ho's down the block, I can always look to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to blaxploitation, Rudy's the man. Nobody is meaner. Watch Dolemite as he and his army of all-female kung fu killers take down Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome plot, huh? There are so many one-liners that multiple viewings are necessary to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple of lines from Dolemite, you are instantly cool.|1
I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews. The script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too. The director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense. It tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. Therefore I had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me. I was always asking what kind of movie I am watching. Then I didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry.|1
"Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons , I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might have occurred during the interview, but here are the questions that popped into my head:

- What role would Angels play in this year's campaign? What do they have to lose, and where do they end up? What can Angels do with their experience and future success? How do Angels and Angels' potential impact on the rest of the world relate to the role Angels play in this campaign? And if Angels and Angels' potential to become Angels has anything to do with the season?"|0
Another first: this French movie is my introduction to the world Eric Rohmer. Perhaps I'm a bit hasty when I say that this is probably my last Rohmer movie but I was immediately turned off by the way Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I thought was never going to end. Honestly, no matter how much I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles. He struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air.|1
POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERIt's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes.|1
I do n't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.I saw this film on TV , i was in the theatre, when it happened to me , and i did see it at the cinema. It was a beautiful film, great movie of a story .I have never seen the film before so I didn't get an opportunity to watch it , I was surprised how bad it made the movie for me . I am sorry if this is difficult for you.I did not get a chance to view it on tv , however , it is a great movie and you can really relate to me.|0
I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola 's masterpiece . I was lucky enough to see it during an interview with him last night, so I thought I might show you one of the highlights I have seen. As the film is released on DVD, you will see this film on Blu-Ray in the UK, at one point costing £22,000 (the price of a hardback Blu-ray is £20,000). The film, released on DVD in the U.K. as a limited-edition limited-time release in England, costs £23,000 (the price of a hardback Blu-ray is £22,000).|0
"In a world full of films -- like ""You Got Served"" -- that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors, you'd never figure that there would be worse films... until now. Ron Hall's ""Vampire Assassins"" does more than cheese you off. It KNOWS that you are mad at it. First: there are no assassins in this movie. In fact, there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. Second: The location... is basically one location: some jackass's house (or basement. It's up to you.)."|1
If you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film. It fails at the first post by not being scary OR funny. It is a dull grey movie that I guess went straight to video. Hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch Diary of the Dead. Poor special effects, school level script. Zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point . This movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underscores.|1
So im not a big fan of Boll 's work but then again not many are . I enjoyed his work and its interesting to think how much time he has taken to write and to think he does have it right . I think i like the fact he's in his own room and if he can write in the same way as you do in my room it makes for interesting work to write in the same manner . This is the reason i'd be willing to spend the whole of my weekend working on new material if i could have been there at the beginning of the week .|0
Chris Penn is hilarious as the all-time stoner brother of Jeff spicoli . This movie is great because it was so funny and the story was so well told . He also did some great things to show how easy it was for the cast to come together. I loved all of these performances . It’s so fun watching a star play in a role so that you can see how it could have been better played by a different actor . The movie was good but I’m not sure how I’d feel watching it .|0
This film flopped miserably in the UK , and it did n't deserve to . The trailer of this film was released in cinemas around the world on 8th April, 2014. In the film, we are introduced into a world that is more or less a dreamland. It is a strange world; it’s a world where everything is real and people have a sense of reality. We are introduced in this film into this world to see how people live and feel and to wonder. I thought this was a clever film, and that the director had a good plan.|0
1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Brett Thompson): Silly, juvenile-focused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment. The script left much to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara like rip-off of some Saturday morning 'live-action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging around. Nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either. I'm just amazed I found this at a Blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old VHS movies.|1
This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is rather interesting if you don't know anything about the way anime studios were run. Besides episode 3, this was probably the least risqué, but it had a nice girl interest, as well as a surprise reunion from others in the previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is it seemed a little too short, but at the same time this may have only been because it was the only original script for the show that wasn't based on one of the manga chapters.|1
A stupid movie , with a stupid plot . Feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a blender . And they actually do it . You can find out who they are and where they're going to get their money if you read their website . . . . they've made a lot of money . . . The thing is , this whole movie was made by the internet and it really is a great movie . I've been to several movies where they would make a bunch of money . . . and the money was real.|0
This film is a cash in. A cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. One step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride!|1
"This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen. Probably ""Okul"" is the first turkish horror film. I must say that I were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons, The first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie, this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before. This shows that turkish film improves itself by time. Although the first trial to make a horror movie, It was really successful."|1
i do n't really know where to start here.just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way from the horror to horror that it would only make it worse for us. I’m not sure this article is perfect, but it is one of the best posts out there. I hope you’re having a great holiday season. I didn’t read a lot of other reviews about horror movies. Most of my friends were not even a part of this review, which was a good thing because I had read reviews like that.|0
I love pop culture, but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this. Then, I seen an episode, and I LOVE IT! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer be playing Doctor Who. He was probably the best one they've had. He fits the character so well. It's sad to see him go. I really don't think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as Eccelson.I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures, such as the darleks.|1
I 'm not surprised that this film did well at the Hamptons Film Festival . It is a shallow film about a man and a woman . But I am surprised that this film did not go unnoticed by critics . For example, it has never been shown at the Venice Film Festival . So many of the critics said they would never have done the film. It is not an extraordinary achievement . There are many criticisms to be made of the film , so many of them are wrong. One critic even said the film did not exist at that film festival.|0
Well, I fear that my review of this special won't heed much different observation than the others before me, but I literally just watched it- during a PBS membership drive- and frankly I'm too excited NOT to say anything. To really appreciate the enigma that is Barbra Streisand, you have to look back before the movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60's. When television was still a young medium, there was a form of entertainment very prominent on the air that is but a memory today: musical variety.|1
This movie is dated in so many ways , it 's sensational . You can either laugh at it or not , but I would rather laugh at something that 's not worth seeing , like 's being a movie , and I think I would rather not see a movie , since I do not like it . But if you get the sense of what it is , I'm sure it's a movie that you could 've enjoyed . I just want to take your time to try it , so I could see if you enjoyed it and if so , what the hell else would you do to get to see it ?|0
This is an unusual film because although it was made by Twentieth-Century Fox because it's one of the few pairings of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck had been making films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) at about the time she made THIS IS MY AFFAIR, but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he only appeared in this film because he was loaned to Fox--something studios occasionally did during this era.The film is interesting because many real-life people have roles in the film, though the piece is otherwise pure fiction.|1
This movie 's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on TV for free , and that it was just as good. I don't know why but I was going to go out on it . . . This was a really cool movie! It was good because I didn't like the movie and it had some flaws. One of it's flaws I was pretty sure I would have enjoyed it more than the movie itself but I wasn't too fond of the fact that it didn't have any flaw.|0
RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed and will fight back when it pleases him. But when she was cast and was later discovered, Joanna found out how much her powers could have been used instead. She now knows that if she had been forced into hiding, she would have never been able to change the world. This time, she decided to do something to change the world. She is not sure exactly how, but she believes it could have happened.|0
"'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book, vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing, but the whole ""Yes!"" fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad, no make that horrible, CGI  even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some sprinkled throughout. Okay, despite those minor infractions, I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior."|1
Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.My sister in law asked me how you can do a better job at a job in the business world and I agree that you have a lot of experience and a lot of skills. And she is the best that she has.So what is the difference between a business professional and a layabout? Are you one of those layabout that can be a real pain in the ass? I think you just want to know if it's worth the money in the world to you.|0
I 've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute best film ever. It was a movie about a very young child who had the chance of making a documentary on her family. She did not get a chance to be interviewed, however she does have a good voice. I've never seen anything like that at the Oscars. She does have a good hair, which is very sexy and sexy, in a way. It was a beautiful and beautiful performance and I couldn't wait to get to work in the theatre.|0
"When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book ""Het Gouden Ei""/the movie ""Spoorloos""(outside Holland, this movie has the name ""the Vanishing"" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - He was told that 'the American Audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the trivia section, I won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free."|1
I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls, smiles, and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.Equally fascinating and sexy, without removing her clothes, is Deborah Kerr.|1
Hey what a great idea to open a film - show someone ` s home movie . Drama schools must have such a beautiful school for a girl to play a bad boy. She has been a very nice woman to be. She can play bad boy for two years. It was her birthday and she was with him for 6 years . You know she will be happy when she finds out he is good for her. I wish she would just spend more time teaching her kids and just go back to school with a friend. He is so kind to her and he is a nice friend.|0
Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad. This movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset. There is no mention of Jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture Christianity as most know it. I am also very surprised because this film is a BBC program and the BBC is quit well known for their quality programing, but it looks like the BBC's attempt to rival the Hollywood psycho/drama films are failing completely. Poor acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion.|1
"I had seen this movie when I was a boy (Before WWII) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. Saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not a ""A"" movie. No editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. Should not even be as high as a ""B"" Had a laugh at how jaded I've become over the years. Seems to me I thought it was good when I originally saw it."|1
"NBC had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of `` The Ten Commandments '' and it is this
that is the basis of the film which has so far dominated the discussion for
two decades in the USA. There are several ways in which the film has made the point that there is
something about the film. Some of those ways are pretty obvious in the film
by the way, and they are by the way I have mentioned in the past, but it has
to be remembered that I have a hard time going on with that."|0
This is the worst of the toxie series by far . The acting in Tokyo is horrible and you can't even tell from the screen what you are going through . There are a lot of them . There are some things you can't see, but if you want to see them I suggest go to the Wikipedia article, it's the most thorough . It's the worst of the series. If you're not going to get to know a bit more than this , but if you want more details , this should be a great starting point for you .|0
"Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match (Mahler's 5th is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film). There are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also an ardent fan of Bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful (try him in ""The Servant"" however). Note: I recommmend multiple viewings."|1
This film requires a lot of patience . Because it focuses on mood and character development , the plot is simple. And because the movie doesn’t start with a single scene. There are scenes that go nowhere, and you can feel a bit like the protagonist. But what happens when you start with a scene and then you have a movie where you feel like you need to have a character. And then you have to have a scene and then you have a movie where you want to really tell the story of how it works and the character development.|0
Some of the secondary actors try, really hard. And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely. Otherwise, this film is horrible.William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He's also a psychopath, a man who quite literally escapes from a mental institution. Is the point of this film that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to get his script read and turned into a movie, even if that means taking a film crew hostage. Do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? Maybe they do.The film's setup is way too long.|1
Lt. Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his sunken ship wash ashore on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). Following a few random prisoner deaths, Rackham takes in Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Luckily for everyone, Barbara Bach just happens to be on the island too! Unluckily, there are some crazy fishmen who like to kill people.This Italian produced exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a dash of WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis stuff.|1
Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through , but how well that work was the one I’ll get to do in this series. The one that I really like to do is a carousel where you can play one carousel and then click it on the next slide to go from there to the next carousel. This kind of thing works great in a number of different kinds of games, and it can go a long way in terms of the games you are playing.|0
"First of all, even IMDb is slacking with this movie, as the list of cast is VERY ""gappy"". Even main characters are missing from it like Buddy for example.Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but this one tortured me throughout the whole 82 or however many minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much, is because I was quite excited about seeing it beforehand.The plot line itself is good. It could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting."|1
Oh what the heck, I'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks!Yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. So they just sit there, and i sit watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. It stinks!If I can exercise my Jay Sherman for a moment, the film really does.|1
"It's a talking, trigger happy, alcoholic ASS COP! I have seen the first and second episodes. The artwork and animation fits very well (note the facial expressions, lol). The main character being a gun toting, badge wearing, pair of butt cheeks, shooting at whoever he thinks to be offensive or ""guilty"". So far, the episodes have had simple and followable plots that work very well with Assy's investigations. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, play's the sobering retort to assy's A.A. antics and random ""I've got a hunch"" leads."|1
I am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie . The acting is astonishing , the movie itself is powerful, and the director is extremely talented . The story is very strong , even if not in my opinion. The music is wonderful. The acting is outstanding . I hope the next movie I will be on is in the same order. I am so sorry about the last two films I saw. I have been watching all last two films for a long time . And yes, the next movie will be in a completely different order .|0
Alfred Hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart does n't appear to be in it . It's about a man who loves to marry and he's going to get a wife. There's a film that goes into a movie theater, it's a theater where you have to dance on the floor, and you have to see the movie that you like. You have to dance with the audience. This is a film that would be very interesting to watch, you have to dance on the floor because you'd like to be the audience.|0
I've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days, and must urge you to beg steal or borrow it.The story begins with a duel between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villain Abbot White, needless to say, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass, and wages his campaign against Shaolin unhindered with the aid of his new ninja allies (a golden clad one who fights with a gold ring, a black clad one who fights with a spear, and my favourite; one who fights with a pair of knives who can disappear and reappear as a flying carpet).|1
"If you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (I guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash), you can't do better than this! The plot is inane, the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO!!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the ""actors"" can sleep at night! It's painful, and yet hysterically funny, to watch and I highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something."|1
I LOVE THIS MOVIE ! ! ! This beautiful , charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable character . I really love it. I think that it will make your life better if you can go back in time and find a love story that isn't boring, just a beautiful love story of your own . I loved this one! You can click the picture on the right-side of the picture below to see my love story . I love you! This is a great way to get a chance to watch my favourite movie.|0
"Daft potboilers don't come much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie which makes everything alright. Except in this case it doesn't. Based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote ""The Robe""), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it's got more uplift than a cantilever bra.Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight."|1
This movie is simply bad . First of all the story is just weird and it 's not good written by an author that I'd have liked to read . That said it's a shame the movie's not a horror movie . Second of all what it is this is a sequel . I think this movie is probably the best sequel from a sequel ever . That said although it is a sequel it's also the most popular movie on DVD . I would give it a 4.5 to be compared to the other two movie films that I have seen on DVD .|0
Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother. He’s always got his own way, too, and that was with his mother. I know he likes his brother; she doesn’t. But her brother is one of the most important figures in this story. In any given episode, Joe, as we’re introduced, has a bit more in common with that mother. He is also a character who makes the show better than any other in the series.|0
You do n't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I do n't know a word you wouldn't want me to say. It's a great film and some of my favorite films to see. But it's something I would not want to see anytime soon if I didn't do it for them.I am a fan of the movie and it has been my favorite movie ever written. I have read every book I've ever read that says this. I'm a fan of it. I do it. I love it.|0
I love movies ... and rarely do I see a movie that I hate ... but this was the worst movie I ever saw ... and it was so bad ... that I hated every other movie ... but I just hated it ... it was ... and I felt bad for a while and then it went on ... and it continued to go on ... until I finally decided it wouldn't be because of my feelings about it ... and that was when it went on ... until ... finally I was ... angry and disappointed ... about the movie and finally I started ...|0
This movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that Katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity Chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. And the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I have seen for a long time.|1
"Three American lads are backpacking their way around Europe , challenging each other to accumulate as many daredevil stunts and spectacular stunts as possible so that they can be “cheated up to the next level”

One of the many things that happens to the British lads over the coming two years is that they don’t like to go into battle, so they make sure they can find the right person to take part in the race. It will be very rewarding for the lads if they become involved in their own adventure, but it is hard to find them if the lads aren’t prepared for what can happen."|0
This must be the most boring film I ever saw . The only positive I can say about it is that it's very interesting. I don't believe in the film making itself, though I do believe in the movie making itself, so it's a good thing for me. But I've had it on for so long. I've been watching and I've learned from it all. I think it's one of the better films to watch because there's always something interesting to watch, just as there is with the movie making itself.|0
"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH."|1
"Totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack: I'd give it (soundtrack)a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is superb! I saw the movie years ago and had to check IMDb to remember what it was about. I obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. It ranges from blues/soul/ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren who is the ""other"" lead guitarist opposite Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band."|1
"Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this ? There 's a bunch of apes wandering around every corner, but most of them aren't real, but some of them can't even move. Maybe it's the movie, and some of the humans. There is a bunch of apes wandering around every corner

So I think the movie might get worse than it does. Well I don't think I can say this but I think this is the only movie that's actually ever got a bad ending?"|0
"I really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental. The acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and contrived that it makes Ed Wood's actors appear life like. ""Sammy,"" the lone black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. His lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery, though I suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character."|1
"1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Waters): Corny Waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience. John Waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with Johnny Depp playing the title role. This movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled ""Hairspray"" but this one is not as effective. Some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky Waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone."|1
But I can't say how I really feel about this pile of steaming dung. Where to begin. The film quality, there isn't any. I've seen clearer pictures on America's FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! The acting is substandard, the gore effects is okay. The clown mask is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least in a Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN we stick with one main character for the most part. There is no main characters, just victims.|1
"Eddie Monroe is Hooooot . He is a great actor and I could be his girl anytime . He 's the best in the game

I do love him! I know he's a nice guy but he is one of my favorites. I have been wanting to take a look at this picture and I've had no luck. The only thing I've done is put him down because he's a bad looking guy and not an actress. Maybe I'm a bit out of touch. I think he's really good. He is a nice guy."|0
This film is all right , fairly silly and to be taken lightly . But what I ca n't stand out in any way , I know it was a long time ago to say it but I like the story. And that is my story. I mean, how do I know for sure I am a true believer? Because my belief is based on this story . So, for now, here are some things I am not sure how to do. And for those of you who don’t know me, I am a professional writer.|0
"Hope the summary line wo n't irritate you that much ( it 's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Sheen). ""What do you think, Will, is it really so much better to write a letter than a book?"" ""Oh, you are right. But why not take some time to read it? Isn't it just the sort of thing a good book will be written, the sort of things that a good book would make it into a book, instead of being written down on a scrap of paper? Why not give it another chance, that is?"""|0
Okay , I love this movie ! ! ! ! ! I watched it over and over again . It was a great read ! ! ! :3 It really made me stop looking for any kind of good movie in this genre . :3 I never had enough movies in my house for the movies . I liked it great , and it was so good . Its my favorite movie of all time . :3 it was my favorite movie that I have loved in the last 2 years ! ! ! I am really loving it . I will give it to someone else .|0
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son.|1
This film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the Kennedy assassination. The are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out. It is a film of the Kennedy assassination, but many of the important facts have been altered. There are missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limo passes the sign, don't fit in. Both Kennedys move noticeably slower then the other four people in front of them. Next time you watch this film look for things that don't add up, such as the Texas Gov.|1
"Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny, genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as Morris' standards. if you think that it is 'awful', 'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: ""go to hell."" thanks. it had to be said!"|1
There are so many holes in the plot , it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience . . . , they knew who was going to make the cut. HERE’S a video from a few weeks ago. They had a few things they’d like to do to make the final cut but didn’t want to do in the end. I have this thought but I don’t know what they planned to do. Maybe they’d use an “overlay” on it, if it had some chance.|0
This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and boring film based on my own research in this country. I’m a fan of the French cinema for my tastes but this was a very good film based on the French language. It was well shot and I enjoyed the film well. In a similar vein, there are two parts of this film that I haven’t looked at yet but are worth the time to watch. It is a fairly short film but you have to learn to see the camera in order to understand the action.|0
If you 're a fan of the original series , do NOT see this movie.I should have been skeptical from the beginning. I was surprised that you are a fan of this. This is a true classic. If you 're one of the fans and want this movie to be more than that, then I will be a fan. And you should be happy about this movie as much as I am. If you enjoy the original series , then you should be a fan too. And I have a number of other reviews on this movie.|0
I was expecting `` Born to Kill '' to be an exciting , high-tension film noir . Instead , it was to be a thriller with a dark and dangerous tone, where the murder of innocent civilians is exposed as a crime against humanity. I was very excited to see it, and was so surprised by how fast it moved I was not disappointed. It was one of those movies that people just didn’t get the idea that it should have taken so long to make. The dialogue is beautiful, but it has nothing to do with a detective or detective story being a thriller.|0
Thomas Mann 's controversial novel is the basis for the film `` A Death in Venice. `` Although in the film, the death of a man's body in Venice, he would not die, because he was not the first person he could get to see. There was a film about it called ''The Death in Venice'' that appeared in 1970. He is said to have been obsessed by the idea that ''the death of a man's heart is the most natural thing you can imagine for a man,'' according to the Hollywood Reporter.|0
An under-appreciated, unseen gem. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in poignant, heartbreaking fashion, the tension that arises between a son who's been to hell and back, and his parents, who can't begin to understand the emotional scarring left behind. It's not unlike Born on the Fourth of July, in that it deals with a soldiers' emotional and mental breakdown after serving in Vietnam, but while that one focused more on the politics of post-Vietnam (anti-war speeches, etc. ), this one deals with a much more personal topic: Family.|1
If a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as I'm concerned. This concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. A good movie has to start and end strong. It all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. There are so many other movies from Asia to watch, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen, that I would really skip this one and look elsewhere.|1
This movie made me want to bang my head against the wall . It is hard to compare such badness with other movies I've watched, but it has made me feel as if I wasn't quite that bad in the slightest, and that I didn't need to have to endure the pain all the way through. It does not matter how bad the movie is, as it was. It's still not as bad as I would like, and this is how it has been since I was a kid. I watched it again a few years ago and it was just wonderful, especially for the characters.|0
"Hellraiser: Bloodline is only a so-so film. I believe it's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.I missed the beginning, and all I remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. But, using my wit and intelligence, (and the Info Button) I soon found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's Box, which, I believe is a gateway straight to Hell.So, anyways, Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the ""Toymaker's"" family. And, that's about it."|1
The movie was very good . I 'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to make it for me, and who will have the best of the movies that I would love to make . But it was so hard . And it was one of those movies that had so much promise , but not enough . I know this was a bit harsh on me but as I've said before, this is my favorite movie I've ever seen . That was the best that I 've ever seen . It was very satisfying . And the characters were so cute .|0
Having seen only once and in the dawn hours, I can't seem to forget this haunting film. A mix of mystery, suspense, and heartbreaking romance it reminds me of Vertigo.The actors, though not that well known are good especially Joan Hackett in one of her best performances.You believe in her, in her love,in her newfound quest for freedom brought by her love, and in the end in her overwhelming pain.The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not stretch credibility. The direction and technical stuff certainly could be better but they do not compromise the overall effect.|1
"If extreme activities ( and I do n't mean the Hollywood ones like UFC & X-Games ) and the people who care to be told what to expect ( like the NFL ) is going to get a lot of attention, and that's a bad thing... if you do it in front of the media, you get what it is: a show in front of a TV audience. I think the fact that people like Michael Cole are getting this show and getting a good deal of the publicity is a big deal...

... I think that's the best part. So..."|0
"""Prime Suspect 4"" continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal."|1
A straight-forward X File that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence . Rob Bowman 's direction is to ask a simple question, 'What is intelligence ? And if intelligence is right , what kind of actions are required ? And so on. There are two answers to this question. First, you might be right if you consider the three-dimensional geometry of a space, but then you might be left off. Second, there is a third answer that you might not be able to answer. You may not know the answer yet, but I can give you some ideas on how.|0
"""Down Periscope"" has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002."|1
Irvine Welsh's follow up to Trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in Edinburgh, all with a few of Welsh's trade marks, drug culture, depression, the working class and Hibernian football club. Uneasy to watch in places, it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to it. Will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will no doubt adopt a cult following.|1
Brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . Their alluring visualizations, such as watercolor, make the movies quite different from their original selves. They are a good example of the way that the movies are made, and I'm very excited to share it with other people. They make it easier than ever for someone to find other characters in the film they love. I've never read one of the movies mentioned here, but if anyone has that, they would be most welcome. This was one of my first encounters with the characters.|0
i watched it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we'd watch it. i didn't want to because it was such an old film, how could that be good ? i finally did watch with that friend and my father. my friend and i loved the film. the songs are great, the actors were cool and we were crazy about it. i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film.|1
I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination , like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights . There is one thing that I found particularly interesting : I can’t tell you what he looked like, though I can’t say enough good things about him for anyone to understand. But there is another part that I don’t know much about : he seems to be the only child of the same father, but his mother is also the mother of her children. This is probably not the first time that a person has said that he was born in a certain way.|0
I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over and over, and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring.The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done, great for today's generation.Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comical relief.This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.|1
Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can again see it.In the light of present understanding of history we have to sympathize with Gen. Leslie Groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of running the Manhattan Project. Most certainly he was not as paranoid about security as most have thought in the past. The casting for the real life people portrayed was outstanding. It was the first time that I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor.|1
Great party movie, following the adventures of Bill & Tom, two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live life straight-laced, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) takes nothing seriously except partying all the time. When Bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues, from his girlfriend, to his brother, to his landlord. Meanwhile, his friend Tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn Bill's life upside down.|1
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film , but this is not true . I did not think it was important, and I can think of a number of ways that it might have been a good film. Perhaps it could have been an example of why a great film should be different, but that is a topic that has to be addressed if the film is successful at its intended purpose. If it's not successful, it would probably be better if it had been good, and if it is not, it could have been better at it.|0
"This movie was obviously made with a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It looked like they made no effort to make the ""future"" look in the least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's (I assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $500). Additionally, its pretty obvious that Don ""the Dragon"" is driving his personal car during the movie (after all, he did partially fund the film)."|1
This movie is something horrible . I was laughing all the time . I was forced to stop in some part of town . I was going to the town to have lunch . . But it turns out there was nothing at all at all there. But the place was closed and they had to make a decision , and that is why the movie was so terrible . . . because it turned out all of this was just an idea . I didn't even really think about it. It wasn’t even funny.|0
This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupting characters, a plot that, at times, doesn’t get any better than that. But that’s not the only reason the film hasn’t been released in the United States. When The Matrix first came out on DVD in 2003, the film was released in the U.S. by Universal and was a hit. It was an instant success and was followed by another U.S. release on Netflix on May 21, 2014.|0
Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other in a room. As a result of this year's #MeToo controversy, the Trump administration’s policies regarding gender-affirming behavior have taken a significant step forward. The President-elect and the White House-appointed Special Counsel for National Intelligence told reporters in a call with reporters this week that he believes “gender-affirming behavior” is a matter of policy, and that “there is a very high probability of this policy to be implemented” by both parties.|0
"After all the hype I had heard about the Jane Austin novel and different film versions of the book I didn't know who to focus on at the time and in what way. So I looked at some of her movies in chronological order and asked her a question of which she was talking about. She answered the question about the Jane Austin movie she had made. ""What is the first thing that I wanted to tell you about a Jane Austin novel that was written by James Cameron? How did you decide on that?"|0
This is by far one of the best films that India has ever made. Following are the plus points of the film...Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very smooth and the timing of changeovers is excellent.Even though the film shows the life of Mumbai Policemen and their hardships, it never gets boring or sympathetic.Mind-blowing acting by lead actor Nana Patekar. One can surely hope that he gets nominated for the Best actor for the academy awards.Controlled violence. The violence is controlled and the film doesn't become a bloody mess.No stupid songs as in usual Indian movies.|1
"i was very impressed with this production on likely all levels; from production to plot and character development.this definitely fall under the ""realism"" genre, since there is nothing going on here that makes use of creative imagination, twists, or manipulating audience in how a viewer shall feel, think and asses.the actors are great, especially the ""little"" ones. the chemistry between the brother and the sister is mind blowing, maybe not even as common as should be in real life. it is a movie excellent to literally watch while visualizing it."|1
Well, here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. The entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept. Instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. What good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place.|1
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. You can, however, see how far she has come.The one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s.The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting.|1
Overall , a well done movie . There were the parts that made me wince , and there were the parts that made my head ache as well . It was perfect! And you can see that I don't want anyone to ever stop me . I just want you to see how it made my hair stand up. I have always been a very protective person , and I never want anyone to think that I know what I am . I know how things have to be for someone to keep me healthy , as I know that you have to know that .|0
oh well ... its funny . should have been a sadistic comedy , a lot of horror movies lack common sense , and its funny . I've seen a few films that I liked, but I haven't been one to say anything about anything like that. There was one film in that direction and it didn't quite work. It's not funny and it was bad but I wasn't expecting much more than I had expected to find on the film but I did get a bit funny and that's what made the movie laugh.|0
There is something that one of the characters ( the aging film director who pretends to be dead ) says is a “cure for cancer.” It’s pretty important that we understand what that means — that cancer is a terrible disease. If we can figure out what the problem is then we can get help. Hence the title of this blog post. The title says that if you want to cure cancer, the first thing you need to do is to have the right kind of cancer treatment you’re looking at. But you can’t have cancer treatment if it’s not there.|0
"OK , so maybe it 's because I 'm from the North East of Scotland and I talk just like I would in the English-speaking countries. But I am not a native English speaker and I am not a native speaker in any language, so it does not matter. So, that's why I am looking for a website or a website that would look like this:

Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches.My sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie, they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces.After every Lnych movie I tell myself, again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name.So, you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time, don't watch it.|1
Another lame attempt to make a movie `` gritty '' and `` thought provoking '' - whatever the hell that means. One of the most powerful and enduring movies ever made was the 1993 movie 'Roots,'' starring Bruce Campbell as a wealthy ex-felon-lover who wants to get married and get married. And when you've seen it, you've come to realize that the only way to bring the movie in the form of a film that is '' '' is for you. In this episode, we look at a few ways in which the filmmakers and producers have put their money into making what looks like a successful film.|0
this really is an `` okay '' series .. everyone in it is pretty good . but i just caely know where to go for this one ... i'm going to start by saying that the first thing we need to know is what is wrong with the system .. there's two things I need to know .. I need to understand what is going on in the first place .. I need to know how to fix this issue .. a couple of other issues I need to understand .. I have been in the past a little bit on the go but I just can't get it right ..|0
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever had and Billie Piper the Best companion! I liked the way the Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the Dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose! It sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons. I will miss watching rose heaps and think that the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role!|1
I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad . This movie has terrible quality. This movie looks just like a bad movie but not a bad one because there are a lot of scenes that have no sound. There are so many that look bad on screen and it looks just like a horrible movie. In this movie there are no scenes to make it look good on screen but when I saw it I thought it looked just like a bad film but it does. This movie has no sound on screen but it looks terrible.|0
I 'm not really sure where to begin . From start to finish , bad , stinky bad , like . It 's ok to get it right , just don't get it right . Sometimes when something bad happens it will make a big impact . We need to not give it so much time . But we're not really sure what is wrong with that . It just seems to be that we have to make the best of a bad situation and not try to take it all into the future . So , when we are done , we will say that you have been given the right one .|0
Yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks-the Classic `` Godfather '' and yet another case of over-hype due to how much you have to pay to play the part of a dad to convince you that you love the guy who does what's best for him or the woman who doesn't know how to play. What's a guy to do at the best of times? Let us explain what's bad, what's great and what's bad in each of them. If you've never watched the movie, let's assume it was a classic. It wasn't.|0
I was amazed at the quality of this film , particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - who I thought was one of the greatest directors to ever be - such a great addition to all the other great films. The film was just as good, though I could not help but wonder why I didn’t find it more than 2 hours before it was done. Of course it was one of those great moments of cinema! And it is one of the best. I can hardly blame the filmmakers for not knowing the film’s story and the direction I was going for.|0
If we really want to get serious and find Osama Bin Laden, then we should take this stinker down to Gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. They'll be singing within minutes. Of course, I'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the Geneva Convention in several ways. Look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch TV at home. So take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little TV zombie. She got up and walked away after about ten minutes. That's how bad this is.|1
Honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love-fest for the murderer, with absolutely no sympathy for the family. The Execution of Wanda Jean, with it's completely one sided view, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. It tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video supported that view. She seemed uneducated, but so did her entire family, but that doesn't mean they were all retarded.|1
**Might contain spoilers**Ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. Two words? Really bad. Now why do I think that? Let me explain. Guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. They do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. However, suspicions arise about Guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. After debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved.|1
(This is a review of the later English release by Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) I really wanted this film to be good. Really, really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked I say, at the quality of this film. Those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever.|1
"Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. This is simply a ""run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc"" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.There's nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. Here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they're actually a lot worse."|1
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70 's exploitation film , except it was done in the late 70's/early 70's in a house where the film was played. This is the most important film in any film I've read so far and is the closest it's gotten in any film I've read since the late 80's. This film has a great story of a group of students who end up losing their job in the real world . The film also has elements that were previously covered by other similar films on similar topics .|0
This morning , I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed . I found myself thinking , `` Oh yeah . Oh my`` . What a great movie . This movie was written by an amazing filmmaker , and was just the first thing I heard , but this film is the first such movie ever made ! Now , how many movies have you ever seen? Well , only three have been made by the same filmmaker , since the first ones have been made by a different filmmaker , but I guess that’s it . I can say that the only four are the ones from the movie .|0
If you love Chan-wook Park , you know what to expect . His films are brutal , poetic , tragic , but everything is not about them. His story is told from his point of view. And he has also had many friends . These are some of the funniest characters that we have ever met . We will not be surprised to know all these characters, if they are the same characters, we will not miss them . But what do you do ? You are the director. In the case of Chan-wook , it is all very easy.|0
This is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies I've seen for awhile. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks from Land of the Lost and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the Chupacabra of legend is much smaller. All in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. Why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop the Chupacabra but the captain's kick-boxing daughter do OK??|1
I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg 's . I was wondering if he has done a good job on this album, or if he just did it wrong and it didn't work out to the good side. I'm not saying it's a big deal, but there are plenty of artists out there who are good at making things work. That's why I'm so curious to see if Mark Wahlberg does something better than he did when he wrote this one, as there was a good chance he did a better one there.|0
"If you were enjoyed by watching ""Guinea Pig"" - then you'll like this movie to! ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements. Actually the effects are not so realistic like in ""Guinea Pig"", but its still pretty gory. ""Psycho: The Snuff Reels"" contains 70 minutes of sex, fetish and then torture scenes. First 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie. After that you'll see fetish sex scenes. And last one is a torture scene."|1
It 's clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters . But I don't think any film would have done it . . . they wanted to have a little bit of dialogue . . . it was too much to ask for . . . that's why they've wanted to do this. . . . For one thing I think the film has a great story line , but they don't need to make it as a whole. The dialogue is more about the characters. There are enough scenes where they're in a different mood.|0
"Christopher Nolan 's first directorial effort , a year before he did `` Memento , '' and this is almost the first time he has made this film

I can't find this film. And I'm looking for another film that won't be in it. It has some really good stuff and some bad stuff in it but I don't like to get into the details. And I'll tell you more about this film than I have time to tell. It's kind of weird, though, because it wasn't that big an issue when we got the first trailer."|0
It's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released. Since there is no information on IMDb I must rely on my other sources and believe it. If this is really true, the movie is even more hurtful and frightening and is it is anyway.The movie is a so-called mockumentary, although I think the topic is too serious call it like that. It creates a scenario where America is like a military state and all revolutionary objects are arrested immediately without proof. After an obligatory tribunal they have to decide if they go to prison for some years or choose the punishment park.|1
Writer-director Dean Bell offered many surprises and engaging moments in this modest yet compelling road film. His dialogue was snappy, and his use of very short flashback sequences was especially effective in the film's narrative structure.At the heart of the film is the character of Alice, who is running away from her New England past in a desperate effort to get to Florida. Along the way, she travels with a pair of eccentrics, Bill and Sandra, who incredibly make the attempt to groom Alice as a prostitute earning money at truck stops.As a newcomer performing in her first screen role, Emily Grace as Alice is sensational.|1
A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.Though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time.|1
Honestly - this short film sucks . the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still not quite what I would expect from a movie based on this film, so I don't know if this is intentional or just a bad choice in my eyes. I would think the film was more of a political comedy, but not as a political drama at all. I did think the film was more of a political comedy, but what I was looking for was some real dialogue with the actual political actors.|0
A kooky , but funny bit of diversion . You kind of have to see it from the beginning to really know it. So, if you are looking to do it this way or this way, then you would probably think about this and how to do it this way. So, you have a lot of options. But it seems like the first one that you would do is just make a video on YouTube and it would look cool. So, if you were to do that, you could do that in the video, and it will probably look cool too.|0
I am very impressed by the reviews I 've read of this film - generally well-read , thoughtful and informed ( I'm not too sure if I am the writer, but I don't think I really agree with what you're saying here ) . I was also given lots of fun extras by the crew and I hope you enjoy their films! The first half of the film is a fantastic movie with a strong sense of humour and character development. This is not the kind of movie the director would have wanted to make. It is very much a comedy movie with an excellent story.|0
Did people expect `` Jurassic Park 3 '' to be full of surprises ? Not one moment of it is. I'm not quite sure exactly what it is or if it's true. There has been a lot of discussion around this issue and some of the comments have suggested that the release date of 3 will be determined by the game's content. This was suggested by a couple of those people that have commented on the issue. However, some of these responses seem to suggest that this release date will simply be determined by how we think about the game in the future.|0
"I simply can not understand how any Who fan , or just plain anyone could find this awful , lazy . Here's how they do it (I think it was a pretty sick joke ):

First we look at the picture, and it seems to be pretty funny (I think this is in the picture of a guy who walks into an ATM). Then, we look at the video. The only thing in that video that was the only part of it that was funny about it, and it didn't seem to really matter."|0
Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is ! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that really feels like nothing at all is possible without a villain in it! You don't get to know what goes on behind your scenes or why things happen. All you really need is a villain and you don't get to really know what he is up to! So if you are going down the wrong path and it doesn't work like he said, you will find out and you will learn about a villain.|0
"I expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election. CBS's last shot at throwing a dig at Bush. This movie was just awful yet I'm still watching it. **Minor Spoiler** I think CBS got the same people who ""provided"" the memo's to do the semi cut in half sequence. What is with the bad boyfriend storyline? Can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a Ed Wood movie. Who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing."|1
Hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of, but also the 'look' of Anthony Perkins. He projected a kind of clean-cut innocence: a young teen-idol type of persona. He was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like, especially in the 50's when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. Which is exactly why the casting of him as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcockian genius.|1
This is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while . It 's not funny at all and looks pretty much like a comedy, and there are some really bad scenes. I don't even know what they are about, but it seems to me that it's funny at its finest. I like it as a comedy but I wouldn't know how to put that into words. I love it, but I'm not really into comedy at all. The acting and writing is what I love about this film.|0
There was nothing remotely funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clichés but nothing about it is remotely funny. Most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. Non The main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film. Also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage.|1
"This movie reminds me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Garden State' not because of content, but because it is one of those movies that you don't hear about except through word of mouth, or you read the back of the DVD at the video store and think ""why not"". Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) at how good it was and how much I enjoyed it.Best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with only intrigue guiding you to actually watch it."|1
The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? You really don't need to find out because, Oh My God! This was so so so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's.|1
What crack are you smoking? This movie, while gloriously entertaining, is awful! The action scenes are so obviously fake it's kind of sad. The colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so hilarious it is almost not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other army guy, I just about peed myself. I could go on...Entertaining, arguably so. Good, no. Well made, certainly not.As a commentary on America as empire, it's actually pretty good.|1
Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It 's a good movie , looking at after war , psychical problem , you know how it is , so i'm glad to see the movie come out, the movie is definitely coming out for you , hope it can hold on for a little while as it's so good . I know, it looks like that, but is it good, I just can't see it yet. But it might come out on the next big thing. Thanks for the pics and good look. You will have to make an appointment with the hospital and ask the nurses for further treatment.|0
I went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. The director was in a hurry to buy tickets and the movie was in theaters, but he did not seem to notice, and he did not bother to show them. When the movie ended and I went to see it, I didn't realize that it could be a little bit entertaining, but then again, I don't remember the movie at this stage in my career. I just did that. I thought that the movie would be entertaining.|0
I was at a friends house for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD of the movie, Eddie Monroe. I've been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years, (I loved the Brothers McMullen), and was impressed how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot on Super 16. The photography was so good, it looked as though it was a 35mm shoot. Furthermore, the music combined with Fred Carpenter's direction, was art. The storyline was original and led up to an ending that surprised all of us watching...very cool.|1
"(The beginning might be a spoiler...)""The Eye 2"" is the sequel to ""The Eye"". It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.The sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. Some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. ""The Eye"" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas ""The Eye 2"" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. Omit watching this."|1
"I think the ""Bone Snatcher"" should go after anyone associated with this movie. Watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. If you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end, you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I'd read. I wish I had my money back. What a skunker."|1
An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea , May 1891 ' . A small lifeboat from a distant shore lies on the southern shore, but the lifeboat stays on a narrow stretch of the strait. From this small island in the Caribbean Sea is a wide range of life forms. The lifeboats are powered by steam, and each lifeboat can take two days or more to reach the water. On a trip from the coast of the Caribbean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean is a vessel that is driven by its own steam engine.|0

Having loved Stephen King 's novels and short stories for many years , I , like most reviewers , have read them a couple of times since the last one. So , I hope to see some of them again soon . A few months ago, my friend and I went and had dinner together. We found a restaurant in North London , which we wanted to go to , so we headed to London , which was very busy and busy , which is where we met my friends , and they were both a part of the dinner .|0
Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here . This is simply a `` run of data ...'' exercise in Python's DataFormatter and the data you're going to write is only data. It's been over a few months since I'd done it. I had to write some really bad stuff myself. So you might think that if you're using a data format like the one provided in this file you should probably use data.h instead. But the difference is that data.h will be the name of your data format, so that is the way to go.|0
"Another winner from that 50s , 60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with each and every movie. I can’t tell you how many times I would have written that script and had no clue what it was. And I probably would. A couple of my faves from each year, and then a few from each year (and a few with the exception of a few from the past)

“Mighty-Mighty-Might!”

A couple of my favorites from each year, I have a few favorite from each year. And I love it."|0
I absolutely love the first three movies , they were great ! I once caught Part 5 on VHS 10 and thought you were going to laugh it off but I have to say that is what I am looking for. So far I am really enjoying them. They were great I love that they have an all-star theme and I really like how the characters are drawn and the main character is just as good as it is. It makes for great plotline and direction. That said, I have to say that I like the first three movies ,they were wonderful !|0
I can only think of one reason this movie was released. To capitalize off the upcoming fame of Guy Pearce. This movie has no merit at all and needlessly trashes Errol Flynn's memory. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown for Flynn in this movie is palpable. An easy way to slander an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time on this utter trash. Watch My Wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography. This movie is NOT the way.|1
Am an ardent Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.It has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.Kabbadi. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain, which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can make one dance. And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle.|1
"* * * * Contains Spoilers * * * * As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook , I watched a documentary entitled, * * * And I was so surprised, I couldn't believe it: I had seen it in a few weeks, and I was so upset, I wasn't sure he'd made it in time. And I asked him what the documentary was about, and he said he would have to watch it. Then I went back to the office and found the documentary for him, which I could not see, but I can still say, ""Well,"" he said."|0
I would give this a zero if they had that rating . Fun was no fun at all . I could just pick up and walk to the house, pick up and walk down and pick up and walk to the house again , and still have it . But still no joy . Anyways, my only regret is that I never bought the house from another company. This is my home in Florida. I am looking forward to having a wonderful house there. My husband is the CEO of this company but I do not consider myself to be financially independent.|0
This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa. A Canadian systems analyst, Zach Straker(Scott Bairstow)is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. Four diamond prospectors are found...well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered. During a long cold desert night a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. Zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one.|1
"Frank Sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best. If I had to name the best thing he ever did, though, it would be his performance as Frankie Machine, the heroin- addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved, just barely, by the love of a good woman (played by an exceptionally babelicious Kim Novak). The ""cold-turkey"" scenes between Sinatra and Novak are terrifying and heartbreaking. The movie is very nearly perfect, in fact, from Saul Bass's title graphics to the ground-breaking jazz score by Elmer Bernstein."|1
Y'know, it's very interesting watching this... half the people involved with it are now dead...Anyways, it's been a long time since I've watched anything Muppet related, but this stuff is pure gold. I'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth, it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character.|1
David Cronenberg's `eXistenZ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture that is plugged into technology that it can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between the organic and the mechanical. The movie shocks the audience with its replacement of mechanical technology with organic, metabolismic one. In this context the technology is able to be part of human body. After playing the virtual reality game of `eXistenZ', the real world feels like a game and as a result, human behavior change in order to apply violent game-urges even when the game is over.|1
Finally ! Other people who have actually seen this show ! It is the funniest anime I have ever seen ! I have also seen a couple of other great anime ! And the show is pretty fantastic ! All of the great characters have been there, it is truly an amazing show ! It is the best anime ever ! I have even seen an episode of it if I had only known that they are actually a show of the same name ! I never thought about it, it was just such a fun idea to have to do it, so I just watched it.|0
This is a great little movie , full of interesting characters and situations . While not in the same class , it is just a good story . It can be read as a film about an old friend . The main plot and ending of the movie are as follows. There are 2 characters , who have a lot to do with the story and characters , who get into some of the main characters , with a few interesting events happenings , and there are also a few important events in this story. The first event happened around 10 pm on the 4th of January last year.|0
I ca n't believe I even tried to watch this filth . As an avid B-Horror movie fan , I can confirm that the first movie is B-horror , and I've read the movie and read your reviews about the first movie. I also read a review that you had about it. This is a really good review but for the sake of the review, do I recommend it? I can't believe this. Heh, that's enough. I had to come to a place like this and get it done, so I did not have to wait a long time, right?|0
Naach A more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web. This one is a good portrayal, although I do not agree with it entirely. Taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle only.Ram Gopal Varma (RGV, seems like a political party) has created a marvel in Rangeela, so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts... I'm not even going to compare Urmila and Anthara.. both are good! The former has better acting talent, although the latter is catching up nicely.Anyways, I like Anthara's character.|1
This movie was sooo bad . It was n't even funny at all . Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny . If you want, you can skip this movie . Instead of that movie, i wanted to talk about it , to talk about how much it sucks and how hard it was to make it better . But i think this movie is pretty cool . We had a great time, and i'm happy with this movie , so i think it's pretty cool to talk about it . And i'm really glad that you guys didn't have to go in for that movie .|0
This movie , although well shot and superbly acted , was awful . I felt as if I was watching a horror film with all the horror and violence , and I didn't want to watch the story with all that violence , as that would ruin the film . The only thing I did like about it was that it didn't seem to be all that bad ( I was only too glad it was there ) But I do like it a little bit better because it has the nice feel , even if it's only a slight bit slow , I feel like I'm doing the movie .|0
Thank God I did n't buy this movie myself ! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of desperation and now it's the first thing I'm going to see. But I think it will be a good one, and I will definitely be thinking about it. Just remember to go to the store to buy the new one. Thank God for that. It's been years since I made this purchase, but as soon as I do, I'm happy that I finally have something in store for you.|0
Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama.Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting.Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. By the end of this movie I felt as if I knew her character better than I knew myself. She did a simply amazing job.Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented her first movie, Leon (1994), in which she played a 12 year old girl.|1
I LOVE Dr WHo SO much ! I believe that David Tennant is the best Dr the show has ever seen and he has a lot going on. I think it is a really interesting story that we can relate to. I have always liked David’s show, I have watched it every day since it was first aired and it is a good show. I have read the stories and it has impressed me the most. I watched him the most on the internet and I really appreciated the story of how David got his head in the game!|0
"People call a 976 ""party line"" to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason. A deranged, somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they don't discriminate! A pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a babysitter for a married man who's hot for her (or anyone).Meanwhile, a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he's the first to discover one of the siblings' victims."|1
"This film is just as bad as ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"". I do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject, a societal outcast.I was in junior high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news."|1
Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself.|1
Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hitch hiker one evening. Two years later, having discovered the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent home, only to find that the man's been hanged for murder. Nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime.Sutherland is the man's alibi but he's turned up too late.|1
I probably have to blame myself but I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the name of ” ” than from an album. I don’t care if there’s a scene somewhere in a novel or movie or a musical or movie that has been created by someone else – I don’t care if my life is going to change for the better when a movie or TV series is actually made. I’ve read a couple of books but I think I can’t remember which one to use for these purposes.|0
"Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers fest in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who don't know about Harry Nilsson do a little research and you'll see that Harry has probably found his way into your life in one way or another - maybe it was his 70s special ""The Point"" or ""Everybody's Talking"" from Midnight Cowboy. For me it started with ""people let me tell you bout my best friend"" - the theme song from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father."""|1
... than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie . What was the motive ? The details of the movie, including a few clips of the shoot of the movie, are very hard to decipher. It seems like a simple, straightforward story, but there's a lot of detail in this movie that just didn't make sense. So, it would seem that the only way to get this movie right is to watch the movie. It just has so much to hide. There's no explanation for what happened in the movie and what the motive is.|0
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie . Such people are disappointed because it 's about a baseball player who has a great sense of humor . He can laugh when he gets stuck , and can laugh when he gets stuck . In the movie, he plays the player in a team and his laugh is what gets him going . I know that this movie might sound funny to some people because I think it's just funny, and is not the funniest movie, but is a real thing . 1. It's not funny for everyone.|0
I bought this film as I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kensit.First off I love this film. After the filming I didn’t want to look at the pictures, but I did.I didn’t get to see that film in the theater when I did. But I was impressed with the casting, especially the cast. They are beautiful, funny, and funny. I’ll admit that I am somewhat intimidated by the casting, but I think they are so good as well, and I am really impressed with the direction.|0
The material is poor....the script's dreadful....the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head.Give this one a miss....even Yancy Butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe.I'm amazed people rave about Yancy Butler.....given what I've seen here and in the couple of other things I've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star...and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well.Last thing is where was this shot?|1
Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except Tedium city. A low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. The best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker. The finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. Oh, I thought of one other good point about this cheese, it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then.|1
Wow ! It 's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode . Ice is one of the most talked about and entertaining shows to ever appear on Television. I watched the whole episode . This episode was well-received and it is a great showcase for the show. It's hard to put into words my feelings for the episode . It is a show that should be enjoyed and watched by anyone and any time. The episode was just as well-received as it is in the episode. It is an entertaining show that will help you to appreciate and appreciate what it has in it.|0
With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably. Things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm's opening credits... We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: The Baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife Rosemary carried into the Castevette's apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog).|1
Oh , dear ! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen . It 's the worst thing that's ever happened to me and it has been very bad. If you can't get it to me, it may not be as bad as I'd like to believe. I want to live with it because if I wanted to go, I could not live with that . . .

Insanely well crafted mini-series.I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS . Was heavily involved in production of the episode when it aired in 2008 and was released. The second time, I remember sitting on a stool while watching the second episode. It's been over four years since the episode was released, and when I saw the first one, I had to have a second time. I didn't mind if I had the first or second time because I thought it might have been the very first episode to air.|0
This is an extraordinary film . As a courtroom drama , it 's compelling , as an indictment on the law, the justice system, and the courts . And there 's a lot more to be seen that doesn 't involve violence , as a judge, as a jury , as a witness , or any other kind of courtroom drama. . And, that is what 's to be expected in this case . If you 've been watching, the jury is usually the one you 're watching to see how they handle the trial. . But if you 've been watching it for the trial , the trial .|0
You don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me.Understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but I could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really well.And the little girl was really cute (she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies).The story is really touching and hats off to Mr. Ratnam for trying something different.The relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically.|1
This series is formulaic and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, Walker goes after him, and it ends in a Karate match. The villains are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. Certainly not Norris's best work. His other work may be cliché but it usually does not drag on for weeks.|1
Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 14th Century. The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight, by showing a rather dreary image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction, and violence. The movie opens with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War, told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed.|1
"Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made `` Bamako , '' but the rest of the story is different. It seems like he thought it over, and said that he thought it over.

'' It's very important for me to keep his secret from anybody that thinks he's lying.'' Boomako said that he knew about Bamako's secret but didn't believe it. He didn't want Bamako to get in trouble for being a spy. ''I'd like to know more,'' he said to me in a quiet voice as the news broke."|0
"A lumberman finds a young cougar in need of help. To young to be on his own the cat soon takes up with the rugged camp workers. Nicknamed ""Good Time Charlie' his antics amuse everyone at first. His wild nature eventually begins to cause trouble and reintroducing him into his natural habitat becomes an issue. This film is among those wonderful Disney nature films that were common in the 50's and 60's Lots of action, beautiful scenery and some endearing animal to charm you. These films were not long but included fascinating glimpses into wildlife and the effects of human contact."|1
`` Strangers on a Train '' was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never heard the word 'stranger' anywhere in the first few hours, so I guess this was the one I liked most of all. '' The Stranger'' was my favorite movie ever in my life, so I've been waiting for it for so long, and even now, it seems, it still feels a bit like a story, one of the best. I didn't watch it last night. It's pretty fun, but the story is a little short.|0
Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. Then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a UFO increase. It turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? This has all the right elements for a classic. It has an actually pretty entertaining script--I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and Mara Corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest.|1
"Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he'd ever seen Mr. Bean? ""Who?"" he said. So I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod off."|1
"I think Walter Pidgeon was badly miscast in this film. Just not believable in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful, and acted her part well enough. No one else was at all memorable. I remember the TV series spun off from this movie when I was a small child. I even think I had a plastic ""Seaview"" that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub. Long time ago.As for some of the other criticism I've read for this film: It's certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by today's standards."|1
I 'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people . The series started off with some really awesome characters but then I was wondering if they would get a lot of love from the people that wanted to watch the series. So I was hoping it would go down well. I really don't give a shit about being on tv, I love it. I just thought that I would make a movie about that when I was looking for it. The movie looks great on tv, but it isn't.|0
the worst sequel I 've ever seen . really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films it made were. There are some good tracks on the track but not enough for me. I'm hoping I will be able to do the other one again . so if you have any more ideas for songs you would love to hear it, send me a review . I know the song is good but I think I have the same problems as the other songs in terms of the style that I'm getting on the album . I only did 2 songs on that album .|0
Well every scene so perfectly presented . Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every way. It's like I was at a funeral when I was a kid, and was looking at my father's coffin as if I was standing there looking down at a dead body. And one time, he was talking to me in his room about what he wanted me to look like, and it's the only way in the world that I know of for certain. There are scenes that are just so perfectly presented and yet not just perfectly presented.|0
I am in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. The film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal. The acting was absolutely dreadful. The children were overly whiny. A metal pole could have done a better job. I wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, I was kept from peace. The monkey's are neither cute, nor are they funny. The drama is laugh-worthy. I cannot remember when I saw a more dreadful film.|1
This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. What I did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating.I love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans.|1
I'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. First is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. The second is from someone who has. (Movie without book) From a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. Nowhere near as good as either of the Underworlds but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking plot line either. The visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice.|1
This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy , yet intriguing performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Lehane. It’s only been a year, perhaps a lifetime, but now it’s time to get back to the basics of filmmaking. On the surface it looks like a movie about an alien invasion of the world that has happened. However, it’s too much like something from a movie about a man who had a wife and three children and now has a business partner who was on the payroll of the company after selling the home for $500,000.|0
Let's get things straight. I was raised Catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. That was useful for two things: to make a convinced Atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he CAN report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards.|1
Man with the Screaming Brain certainly is n't a perfect movie , but I 'm pretty sure it was never gonna be, and it would probably never be made again. If you are willing to make a movie like this you should be ready to put a film on display in theatres. And yes, I know it would be too much to hope that you would do this yourself. There are so many aspects that make a film great that they just haven't done. I've only seen a few films made with this type of mentality, though. For example...|0
Okay, sure, this movie is a bit on the hokey side. It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, anyone? ), but this tries very hard. I've never read the actual comic book, but that doesn't really matter, I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits, not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless its a film based on a true story, that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.)|1
Formulaic to the max . Neither title reflects the serial 's actual content , `` Fighting Nazis in Morocco , and all of their content''. So it is very possible that we could not have made it into this title! The title itself would have appeared to be different from the actual content. It would have been quite easy to see what was in front of the screen and not as a blank page (which is very rare). I hope that you find the answer to this post interesting and would like to share the results on the page (not that I know of) in your comment section.|0
MASTER PLAN : have the winning team in a deadly tournament . One of several martial arts action pictures that can be found on the main page of this site (in this article is not part of this article). If this is true, then it means that one of the most important games on the planet (in this case, the Grand Prix in Formula 1) must be in the final stages of World Championship racing. And it is important for this game to be successful so that one gets a winner. But there are many others who have not done so yet.|0
I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation . Having just recently seen a movie on my laptop I was reminded of how the first two seasons are so deeply flawed . I thought I would try to understand why it is this way . After the first five episodes , I wanted to know what I would have done . I know that there are very many episodes that are very poorly executed . So I watched five episodes from the first to fifth episodes on my laptop and then I did the final one for a total of nine episodes .|0

"A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT (""scapegoat"") for a dangerous escaped murderer.This is a wonderful, hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases, Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats, Buster Keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic, silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928."|1
Okay , so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again ! ' Week in , but maybe a little longer and in my opinion . The problem is that it's not a good way to be a teacher. If I wanted to go to school, I'm sure I'd walk in the room. If I was going to school, I would have to go to the gym, which, I didn't think I'd want to, because I would never know if I was on the gym.|0
my girlfriend, as we walk in the cold London evening in leicester square, after the movie, says: if they didn't speak English and they didn't show the stadium, you could have thought this was the slums of a South American city or some other slum anywhere in the world,not Queens in NYC.Ramin Bahrani is , right now, my official hero, because he seems to have devoted his work to show not the OTHER face of American, but the REAL face of America.Ramin Bahrani's movies are like Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta' aperta.|1
I 've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film . I 'm in total agreement with all the reviews I have reviewed. They didn't have to review it, however. If you have any questions about my review, I'd be very pleased. My review wasn't really good . I can't say I 'm against it but if you think of what I have said I will be very happy about it. I hope it can be made more convincing by getting some more info from my sources.|0
This was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the start. Wooden Camera is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director. The film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid South Africa. The young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichés.|1
The film opens with the director talking to the camera and saying he is going to show a story about a group of people, which will then be shown on a film screen. It is very, very cool because I was watching the first one. We were all staring at one of the screen. The camera was filming the scene, and I turned the screen upside down and saw a couple of characters standing in the middle of the film. And then I was like, “Oh, my God. That was so cute”.|0
my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago . and , i must say , this is a great little space . i was looking for one with a nice screen size but its not an option. . Hi there, this is my first time on a site and I have been following this website for over 20 years and i have been following your page regularly for over 3 hours. Thank you for your patience!

The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934. I purchased this because I like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. It certainly isn't.It is about a couple who head for Egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers.This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which lets it down a lot. It is quite silly in parts. Depsite this, there are some good action and location scenes.The cast is lead by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest.One viewing is enough for this movie.|1
Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat, this film rings true on the chaos of the post-war.Beautiful photography, and a powerful national expression of the Polish national character.It's very slow at points, but its entire pacing is so different from American and Western European films that it's quite refreshing.Both lead actors do a very good job. On the DVD version, you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew, and the lead actress Stanislawa Celinska has gained about 50 lbs and lost all of her beauty.|1
I am a chess player and I wanted to like this film . Trouble is , the content could have been a bit longer and I didn't like it , but I also liked it and could have added some content. It could have worked well , but there was more to it than what I had. I have already posted about this film for the last few days so here is the link for it. You can see the video here. The film can also be found on YouTube here . There is an upcoming movie in theaters that I want to see.|0
Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really people, the maniacal laughter & mayhem during the withdrawal scene? Did you not see that coming? I'm surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. The acting was fine, sure. But to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language. Things happen, but that's it.|1
I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say , `` Ben Johnson ? ! '' - he was a great Canadian politician, he was not shy to speak up and say something controversial. In the mid-90's I heard the same thing. I also heard that the man was a good American politician, that he could not speak to Canada. In the same way a lot of the people who were doing the right thing in the Conservative Party did the right thing - and I'm glad they didn't. I don't think any of them would have said that.|0

The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film . Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat. I didn't realize how much of a disappointment I'd had watching The Cat in the Hat without knowing it (which is why the first few times I tried it, I found that it worked better). But I'm glad I didn't. There's a lot that doesn't work so well. I'm still hoping that The Cat in the Hat is better than it was when I started playing it (which I did at least once before that, at least for me).|0
I 'm not sure if this is a comedy or not , but I found it pretty comical . Isobel had a few jokes , but he did not seem like a bad person, it was just funny . Isobel was so nice to all the people he was with and so funny to everyone . Isobel does not like any of them either. I think it was one of his jokes , but I thought he would be a great joke . I'm sorry I can't tell you a joke with him , I just wanted to get you guys in the mood .|0
Nothing more than a soccer knock-off of The Mighty Ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. This was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.|1
A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this . A lot of these trailers are actually about low-budget projects like that . It’s not the worst thing that ever happened to me, but I really love horror films because I know how they do. If you have any horror-related questions that you’d like answered, feel free to leave me a tip on how you can get your answers out there online! Thanks! Now, this site has many good questions and answers for you!|0
"This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role. It's just incredibly bad. The editing is especially awful; it really appears that the editor (if there was one)literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together. The opening has to be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned! I know there are ""B"" films - but are there ""H"" films? If so, this one's an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan."|1
`` Hey , I did n't order no cab ! '' `` Yeah , well you got one ... '' He sent it over, he said, as he said ... `` Well I was just about to order one of your things. He said, well if it doesn't have any value I want to get it. I got it. But it still has nothing.'' He said he will get the one that you ordered but that's about the time you're finished with it so you don't want to wait too long before it goes out the other door.|0

"The thing which makes ""Fire"" even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry, is its touch of femininism and rebellion. To my mind, the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society. The name of the movie and the scene when Radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of Hindu Mythology's Lord Rama's wife Sita's walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy, as per the same narrative which appears in the film too."|1
"Pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a compilation of clips from horror , science fiction and suspense film

For the most part, films that look good but aren't really good are either not as well known as they are today or they are not worth much more than the ones that were created for that purpose

I think that some of the better films are either not well known or not even good at all. In some cases, I think there are plenty of films that look good but aren't truly good at all."|0
"I totally agree. This is ""Pitch Black underground"" and a well worn plot. The best scenes I thought were the divers exploring the caves, going through impossible subterranean passageways, some of them were heart pounding. The scenery was great. Had they dispensed with the staple ""alien"" toothy CGI badboys entirely the movie would have been much better. All they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this might have been a top rate hitchcock-style thriller, maybe award material."|1
"""Strike Force"" or ""The Librarians"" is a fun action movie that doesn't it take itself too seriously. William Forsythe stars as Simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets up with Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone-her sister. But there are evil bad guys afoot. The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the movie."|1
"Forget Jimmy Stewart reliving his life and opt for this smart comedy of errors instead. I suppose only institutionalized sexism explains why this flick and Stanwyck's other great Christmas story, ""Meet John Doe"" aren't revered with the same level of love as...well, you know it's name.Stanwyck plays a food writer for a McCall's-type rag who has been lying for years to her pompous publisher about the folksy setting for her recipes. She's an ace b.s. artist until the day Morgan's sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days afloat & 6 weeks recuperation in a Navy hospital."|1
This is such a fun and funny movie. Highly entertaining at all angles. It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts. We got; the judge, the Sargent, the kid, the creepy old lady, the slut, the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn't have any locks and is understaffed. So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way... never give your patient an ax! This was before Cukkos Nest, AND surpasses it.|1
Don't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one. It is, but that, does not a good film, make.Comedies require a well-honed script and masterful direction. Sadly, this poorly executed film has neither. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not deliver in his comedic farces (Les Bronzes series being another example).The comedic timing is terrible. Some jokes are telegraphed. Some are re-hashed from other movies. Others just sit there as if they were giving you time to laugh.|1
The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen its final release in the UK on Wednesday. It is a project that was conceived after the fact by a man who claims it was designed to prevent cancer from occurring. In fact, the team behind the project has been busy and they have spent months trying to solve the problem. For the past seven months they have been trying to fix the project so that it will never be seen by the public. However, in the end, their solution only worked in the UK.|0
Writer/director John Milius takes a little-known incident from American history and extrapolates wildly in all the right ways .

I was just a kid then . . . but the most fascinating thing of my life has been a little boy . . . and, of course, that's what you get when you're the kid. [Laughter.] [Laughs.] [Laughs.]|0
Rififi is a great film that is overlooked . It 's a crime drama where a man gets out of his home and a woman gets into his car to take a photo of him on his way to his wedding, but the movie is not good . It takes a great deal of effort to film and the actors are talented and talented at acting and acting, but it doesn't add up much . The only real complaint to me was that I couldn't see the film in the cinema for a while, but it didn't detract from it either .|0
As I looked at this movie once again, I think it belongs among Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense, action and imagery. It has the gripping ending, the deranged murderer, the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances, some great on-location shots, e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies.|1
"After putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. Soon enough she's stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures out from under their nose. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.This is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of ""Belphégor"" before."|1
"Beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. Everything from the cinematography, the directing, the acting.....brilliant. At any point of the film, you can pause it, and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or ""artsy fartsy"" as some people would say. I assure you, that after one viewing, ""Bobbycrush"" will be stuck in your head. I know this from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film."|1
"Throughout watching ""End of Days"", I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average Hollywood action film. They failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. He attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see ""Se7en"") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us."|1
This was a sordid and dreary mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information. Since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals much about Hollywood and its psychosis about women). What's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky.|1
"My favourite movie of all time . This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary, the movie would not do well in any other context, which would have caused problems for many fans. But for the film as a whole, the documentary was just a way of making things happen. I'm not saying I like the documentary, but my opinion is probably correct. ""I don't think it's a good film and it does not address the problem the film addresses. However, it's a good film."|0
Chupacabra : Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made . I had never seen Dark Waters , I would have loved to go back with the trilogy but this was the first time i had seen the series of books that have been released. The first two films have been set in New Orleans, while the third was released in Chicago in 2010. It is also one of the earliest movies that i have seen when I was in Chicago. Dark Waters is an interesting film, but i would love it if it was made by one of my friends .|0
It's just when a band tours, and only has one original member. It's not the same as the classic line up. All new actors playing the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc, with Ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. And he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. The film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&A movie, this one is a turkey.|1
Barbershop 2: Back in Business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny. The movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable. Back in Business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot. Cedric the Entertainer's terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel not needed, without the originals charm, soul & spark.|1
Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' Week in, week out David Morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven! !Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going to a season series - but you never know?|1
"What a silly movie. While it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's ""madness"" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst Victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not been able to get past Essex's sexual attraction."|1
"Thankfully you don't need a lot of ""book learnin"" to understand where this thing's going... Obviously a poverty row cash-in on Universal's big hit THE WOLF MAN (which was made just one year earlier), this finds the always-watchable George Zucco in another of his patented ""mad doctor"" roles as brilliant, vengeance-minded scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what I'm presuming is the Louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job."|1
"I 'm sorry , but I can not understand what people were smoking when they wrote how great they thought it was , what could I do . And I would also appreciate any advice you provide . Please share in the comments with us. Thanks a lot

Thanks! Thanks for sharing! I have a lot of things that I would not even have the right to discuss with you. But I would not hesitate to ask you what you think was the cause and why but I am not a person who could not understand why someone was smoking."|0
Almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a schoolteacher housewife who suffers from amnesia. She'e even on the PTA! But then an auto accident awakens the woman she used to be, and it's HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help Davis find her past, only to find out he's in way over his head. Davis has some hilarious lines too, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well.Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally managing to shed his St.|1
i did n't hate this one . i just could n't adapt to the story . it did n't really feel like a good story to me . i just couldn't keep up with it , it was a mess . but how could you ever get back on course , it was so bad . i just could not concentrate . it was so hard to find something new to write on . i just couldn't do it , it was really hard to be around it and to be a member of it . i just could not stay around the story .|0
THE SCREAMING is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video . It features passable acting , but does not give the audience much of a feel. There is a scene when the girl in the background is very upset because she thinks the guy was stealing her underwear, but then, she doesn't even notice because it's too dark. This is obviously not a good movie but maybe it's a good film and it is still worth watching. Also, they do a great job of doing the background scene, but not having much characterisation.|0
"The only pure life , is one that ends with a signature in blood.So says Mishima anyway , a young student of mine . His mother, in her twenties , had been divorced, and now was a widow . “But,” I said to her, “I think I was just a child.”

“Well, my mother was in the army and she had a wife and children. I thought that would make it a more fitting end .” She shook her head in wonder

She was quite a nice young person, she’d be a good husband."|0
`` Go Fish '' garnered Rose Troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.Its then, the following, and it is now one of the most influential films made in the English language, and a classic in its own right, by British film makers, with a vision of the future of American cinema.It was also the first British to be recognised as a cinema.In the early years of the silent era, the film industry in Britain was dominated by studios and box office numbers. It was not just the biggest, but most influential producer, director or star in any film to date.|0
Actually I 'm still in doubt if there 's anything about this movie I like . As for the story I 'm not totally sure what it is , and I don't know if I really have any experience or anything else. I was watching the movie the day after the incident, and I couldn't believe how I was sitting there with the guy who was telling me he wanted me killed. This film is not my favorite film I've seen, but this is the only one I'm interested in watching. For some reason this movie isn't the best movie I've ever seen .|0
first off, i'm amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to IMDb and jacking up the rating. but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity. i mean, this film is simply awful. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some (unintentional) laughs.|1
"I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from Showtime, but this was easily the worst of the bunch. It's really too bad. Part of this may be due to the poor, if odd, choice of source materials. Why Joe didn't just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this soapbox episode where the ""message"" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and by the end I was just wondering whether it could get any worse, and I won't spoil it...but it ended up getting worse."|1
This is an excellent film, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget film) is much better . I would recommend people go to see Momento and then if they like that, see this film. THe film is shot in black and white which I was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing.|1
`` Wagons East '' is widely known as John Candy 's last movie , as he died on the set on May 8th at the age of 63. '' Wagons East'' is based on ''The Last Movie''. It was revealed earlier in the summer that the movie was the last to be filmed on the island during the summer of 2009. The first film released was ''John Candy '' (1955), released in 1956. '' The last film in this series (1957) is titled ''John Candy'' (1955).|0
"""Ahh...I didn't order no amazing hit show"".....""We'll you got one"" Hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. A little bit of me died when I flicked on the t.v. one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasn't on. The show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed. I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate."|1
"this is horrible film. it is past dumb. first, the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them. they are in 7th grade. not to say i am a prude or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. being pretty and popular is not everything. but that is what the twins make it out to be. The plot is even worse. the girl's grandpa just happens to be the ambasitor(sp?) to France. He has a co-worker take the girls around paris and they meet two ""cute french boys"" with motorcycles."|1
This movie is bad. I saw the rated and the unrated versions. They are terrible!! Now, I know it's suppose to be a low budget, porn spoof of spiderman, but Spiderbabe is just not good at being bad-good. It's not funny! Not funny at all!! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie let me down. At least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to. And is it me, because Mundae is not a great looking woman.|1
"*some possible spoilers*Of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. But, this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been a lot better. First of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What where they thinking?! Unlike the ""harmless"", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. In efforts to make his Bates seem innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay."|1
"Fun, entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson), while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I can't see why. It's beautifully shot, has wonderful costumes and interiors, and exciting aerial dogfights. Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--""Whistling in the Dark"". The movie does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows."|1
Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. Not only that, this movie is Boring. I say that with a capital B. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.|1
I 'm a next generation person ... i 've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the miracle in a public health department.

"Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper / lost treasures animes out there . A sexy comedy , one of my least favourite movies ever , but its really good . I loved the movie ” “ ‘O” , but this is my favorite . I would never be a movie writer . I love movies like this . There are so many wonderful movies on Netflix, but this one is the ‘lost treasure’

There are so many nice movies on Netflix too. I love it that way. And I can say that there aren’t too many people who love that kind of film."|0
Eaten Alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year 's Cannibal Ferox . The characters are universally bad, though, but there's little to show for it. Though the characters are good, their flaws make them the kind of characters that could never exist. And yet, it is just as important to understand what happens next for your characters as what happens next for the audience. They have to remember that for the characters to really make sense, they’ll need a reason to live, a reason to be good, a reason to do it, and so on.|0
Another winner from that 50s , 60s era that I love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days .Corman never lets you down with these films , they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets , a recipe for good watching for sure . Ed Nelson a very competent actor got started with Corman as well as many other favorites who show up in Superman and many of the westerns of the day . The costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking , well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it .|1
As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs , `` Gag me out the door . '' I would have liked to find out if it was the right choice, or maybe just the wrong one. The first option was for us, but the next is for me. So here's the first step, then I was able to find out more about you, and how I've made my decision to stay and stay. My first two months are over and as I told you last week I was looking forward to having a new home.|0
The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. Sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. It starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that's the only blood in the entire film.The Evil Below isn't the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. The acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads.|1
A rather mild horror movie; if not for a couple of sex scenes, it could easily have been a TV movie. Plot holes abound (one example: why would there be a secret passage from the 18th century leading from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building put ther 200 years later? ), cardboard acting, characters doing things that anyone with an IQ bigger than their shoe size wouldn't do...It's got a few fun moments, but overall it's a sub-par film that managed to get Roy Scheider because his bills were due.|1
WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.When I first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how Rodriguez and Tarantino both helped make the film. I began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. First, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where I just wanted to turn it off.|1
Honestly , I do n't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show . It embraces the whole of the science and philosophy of physics. I don't really understand what it says about how the Universe was created. I understand why it does not explain it properly. If it does not explain the universe in a way that you can understand it better, then we don't understand it better. I really do not understand why people have not made progress on this issue because I do not know what they would say.|0
In London, the Venetian Carla Borin (Yuliya Mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend Matteo (Jarno Berardi). She meets the lesbian real estate agent Moira (Francesca Nunzi) and rents a large apartment. When the jealous Matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover Bernard (Mauro Lorenz) in Venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral Carla has a brief affair with Moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. When Matteo comes to London, he concludes that his lust for Carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior.|1
"The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raking in a fortune, which is why she is so darn hot for the first season. This is a good time for Jane’s next show. I can’t stop watching the first episode of Jane’s Next Series, but I can help you with a few more. Jane Turner

As you all can see, Gina is a star on The Good Wife series. And Jane is a beautiful woman who works hard to make her life a whole lot easier!"|0
"This is an odd movie. On the surface it's no different to many other d-grade gore movies but in at least a few ways it stands out. Firstly, the main killer character is really weird. How the heck a guy who only ever clucks like a chicken got paroled is totally beyond me. What was that female parole board member thinking: ""he's totally reformed and rehabilitated"". He clucks! Another problem with Luther the Geek is the script/direction for the women. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she was mine I'ld slap her."|1
"if u haven't seen Vijay in ""Ghillli"", ""Gilly"" or ""Ghillie"". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this one, look out for someone who calls Velu ""Maacha"". The one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are brilliant as well. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It is very deep. Watch it, you won't regret it."|1
"Spoof films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said ""Don't be stupid, be a smartie. Come and join the nazi party"". It brought us delightful films, such as 'Young Frankenstein', 'Airplane! ', and even 'Naked Gun'. But the good die young. Luckily, the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's. And then... the Wayan's Brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'Scary Movie'. Suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes."|1
I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle movie. I really liked him in his (title) role as a butcher boy. The way he moves is very funny in my opinion, for example how he handles his knife and the way he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expressions really suit the role he plays, for example how he winks at the audience in the end. But one might add that that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he would have deserved a longer career.|1
The revisionist history -- making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic -- is mind-boggling enough. But the atrocious acting, amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad. The only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous. And, amazingly, being tortured for days, with hands bound overhead, apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and makeup. My guess is that the producers filmed mostly in Russia, choosing women for their looks -- and willingness to work cheap -- rather than acting ability.|1
It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.Christopher Nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time.|1
When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought `` god , this is horrible ! '' But I've never seen such a '' terrible person'' (because I don't see why they have such a name), so I thought that it was better to just have someone else take it as a joke. And that was after I finished watching the other day. This morning I've been trying to figure out if I'm supposed to get a laugh out of it. So I had to do a quick google and see if I could find a reason to do this sort of thing.|0
"Yes, it's a SBIF (So Bad It's Funny) classic. With a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely NO even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! Camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. Blood looked like watered-down cherry Koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the ""human"" bones, and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask Wal-Mart could provide.Did ANYONE involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was?"|1
Although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release , I feel that it is more important that they be made in their original form when they are put on film and that they have been made in some form since the advent of movie production. This is an important point to make here as it is very easy to change a movie in a film and change it in another film, and it is also easier to get a film made in a different form after having made a movie at the first time of production of a film.|0
"Okay it is terribly , and I mean terribly , easy to pick apart this film . C'mmon what do you think? ?"" ""Yeah, you go ahead. !"" ""Why do we need to go back? !"" ""Why do we need to go back? Yes, I want to see if we're ever going back. !"" ""I'll take care of this later,"" I said, and he took me to the office. ""What's the problem?"" He said, ""I need to take the computer and take the computers to the computer."|0
Cute Movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something. It was like being in a movie that has nothing else to do with the movie. I liked it but I was very skeptical. I wanted to know how the characters were going, how they were feeling, what they are thinking and making decisions. I thought it was something that everyone in the audience would watch, but it was a different movie. It is a very different movie because the characters are different from the ones you see every day.|0
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal dentures, bites people on the neck, and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms. He also thinks he's a chicken.Sounds bizarre right? Well, to me, the more bizarre and weird the person is, the better. The more gore, the better and so on.The movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck.|1
It's one of the imponderables of low-budget independent film-making that so many with so little in the way of real talent fancy themselves frightmeisters. The paucity of talent evinced by these wonky wannabees is there for all the world to see. Case in point: FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly came to know it, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There's nothing wrong with paying homage to one's heroes. I've done it many times over the years, myself, in many different ways.|1
Plodding , maybe that should have been the title . Bad dialogue delivered at a snail 's pace . Allowing us to concentrate . We know it has a place in this story but it's not easy . We have to keep the tension low . It has to be on . In other words , it's about . It's also about . This has been said . If this story is being told to a girl, I'm sure that she'll remember . If this story is being told to someone else, I'm sure she'll remember . . and that's it .|0
The only time I seem to trawl through IMDb comments is when I 've seen a duff film . I have no idea what to do with them . I have always seen them at all times. I have seen a duff film that was made by someone who is very intelligent . It's the kind of stuff that I love about movies , but in reality , they're not funny . They've got an audience. They're not funny or anything , so I'll never see them again . I love the fact that this movie was filmed with a camera so that the actor could be seen from any angle.|0
If you liked the Grinch movie ... go watch that again , because this was no where near as good as I was going to be. If you have not played it and will want to buy a second watch, I suggest you go watch this one again. You get the picture, and there’s no telling how good the game is going to be. There may be some minor glitches, but you should definitely enjoy the game for the money, especially if you got your hands on a decent watch. That is the title, but what does this all mean for the game?|0
A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely, there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses, this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part.|1
I was a fan of Buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when Angel got only one hour and 20 minutes for a special episode, but I just can't see it happening. But I was hoping that it'd come to the end. It would seem that Angel will have had enough time for the story, but that's not in her nature, she has to be in the midst of her time with the audience. This would be a good thing to happen, since the plot could have been much different, but that wasn't really what I had hoped for.|0
Okay , make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film , but I actually thought it had a chance to be as great as it is. And if it weren't for you guys watching it, that would be a pretty bad picture. It's not as good as it looks , but it could make it a little more entertaining and if there is any more to be learned about this film that could be more entertaining. But I don't have time to watch it. I'll just have to look for it. Thanks for stopping by.|0
This is one of the most unoriginal , cliche-ridden movies I have ever seen . Even if you did n't care to watch it in theaters or not, it really makes you think about it. You know how you should, right now . . . you've got to understand the basics. The first thing that struck me was that it was not very good. You know when people think they're watching this . . . what does that mean? You just don't have an idea why. And then there are the issues with that. You can think it's not very good.|0
Almost missed it. While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980`s, I was channel surfing after everyone else went to bed. It wasn`t just Bogart he was obsessed with; but rather the entire era of those old flicks those of my age know so well. Add to that a plot liken to The Maltese Falcon - where so many different characters were interacting with Sacchi - and you have a piece of art as far as I`m concerned. About ten years later it appeared on TV and I taped it.|1
I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely . If it is a great movie I would say it is a better one than the other two. If it is a better movie than The Hobbit or The Hobbit, I think that it was the better movie of both than the other 2. The Hobbit is not that good, the Lord of the Rings is not really that good. If there is any point for the Hobbit I guess I am going with that, but it doesn’t seem that well defined.|0
Some of the secondary actors try , really hard . And camera shots in the desert are quite lovely . It is also a bit of a rarity , but it is also a rare sight ! We like it . You can use it in most scenes with a camera in the desert . I like it a lot too . But it should be possible for you as a beginner . Here are the photos you can use for this project . Let me know if there are more photos , so I will know your name , if you want more photos!|0
I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people I know.Great moments between characters  including many of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together  were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through. Beautiful and ill-fitting phrases rattled away from Lawrence in particular as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his pulpit of beer crates.When watching any film with Maori actors, I've found that I can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life.|1
Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies i 've even seen . Obviously this is n't intentional though . It's kind of just what you'd expect. . If we can get rid of that one thing . it'd be so good. Oh my god! What is it? Why are we like that? We look like we are about to run out of ideas, so let's just keep it up. Let's also look at what it's going to cost. We'll have to put out some more flyers. It will be like this one.|0
"This movie is funny in more ways than one. It's got action. It's got humour. It's got attitude. It's got Dolemite's all girl army of kung-fu hos! And that's just what the movie offers as a film. It's also badly acted by some, the mic makes more than one cameo appearance, and some ""punches"" miss by feet. But when you make a movie this cool, who's got time to pay attention to those ""details""? This movie rocks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it..."|1
"I don't know what it is exactly, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf, with no thought of ever leaving me...Fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infested and well unique movies I've ever seen. Not sure what else to say about it, but I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! The steak tartar scene is absolutely uproarious, and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious...I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but has anyone heard that, based on this film, Fulci accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with ""Scream""?"|1
"There is a point in the film where the female boss of the ""death machines"" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive I think it's called these days) talks about using leverage on a business man. Except such is her delivery that it sounds like ""leatherage."" At which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness. But it didn't. The boss lady had to do the talking as the ""death machines"" did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does."|1
I thought this was a great action flick. A very good role for Geena Davis. She is a very versatile actress. One of my favs next to Angelina Jolie. I actually watched The Long Kiss Goodnight right after seeing the new Tomb Raider movie. It got me thinking, Charlie or Lara? Which one would win in a fight??? Either way, both women are very strong, intelligent characters that are fun to watch. Especially when they're kicking butt. I just hope to see Geena in another film soon. Seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long.|1
"I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself , but I was getting bored because I didnt want this movie in my life but I would love to watch a good movie like this. Here are some of my favorite movies of my life:

Moby Dick

In my life, most people don’t give much thought to what a movie looks like and what we would call it. But I knew that my life would be different, and this movie would have a different vibe."|0
This was a great movie . Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of Black history. I would like to thank all of our friends and loved ones who have contributed to the project. We can't wait to read the rest . I can't wait to meet you as soon as time permits . I've spent a lot of time researching these movies. But I'm curious to see what you think of these. They are very fun and interesting. If you like some of these films then I highly recommend checking out Black History Month and its many other movie festivals around.|0
My mom and I , rented this movie . I mean , we love those type of Sci-Fi flicks , and we were both very happy when it came time to watch the movie! Well, it was a great experience when I came back to the theater after seeing the movie , and I loved it so much and was so happy that I came back to watch it again, so I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't a part of something else. I loved watching the movie because it's so fun to watch sci-fi flicks . I'm so glad that you liked it!|0
One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. I tend to like B movies that are original and have heart, and I think this is one such work. The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual, maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director, and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent, watchable piece of art.|1
This movie didn't do it for me, an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz' portrayal was OK, but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL, walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989, not 1975.|1
No matter what other people have said you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed on it's own it would be a 2-3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4-5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards. If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original.|1
Obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point : the little Vasque town of Obaba . It's a nice and clean town. It's in a great area, with a great restaurant. On the bus station there is a good bus stop and some nice shops. On our bus, the little town is on the far right of the highway and we're not sure of which direction. In this part of the world we live in is a big country with a good many things to see and do. In Obabakoak I have my two favorite things.|0
Normally I am a typical `` creepy-crawly-hatin ' '' girl , but after watching this film ( on YouTube of course, I've already had a couple hours with it ) I wanted to ask you... I've seen the video for the very first few minutes ( since it was released on YouTube I didn't find it very funny ) of the show, because that's when you've got all the elements that you need and the sound of it, but before I can ask you what that is, that's how I get it and I think I'll just tell you...|0
"Some describe CALIGULIA as ""the"" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.For a while it looked like it might."|1
Let 's face it.This movie is incredibly cliché , as Korean romance dramas and movies go . First of all, when you read the above review, you probably don't have much in common with the movie. Second, you probably don't have anything in common with the rest of the movie. Finally, the Korean romance drama is one of the worst movies I've seen on TV! It's not a bad movie or series, but it still isn't great, or any movie. It simply isn't good for you.|0
I rented this movie , after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of `` five stars ! ''I don't see that. If it's a bad thing, I'll go ahead and say that, so that you can say it's a good thing, but I think it's a terrible thing to say!'' I mean I think if it was just one star, people would probably not get it, because that would just be too much. But, hey, I don't think people would say a word about it.|0
Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time . In fact , I want to see another movie that was not as great as last one, but was quite a bit more. It is not just that the plot was terrible, I have to give it a lot of weight. It is really, really terrible. It is hard to say how good it would be, and there are many movies that are very good for me, but I would recommend them for a movie that is a little bit better.|0
Barricade finds Alice Faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee China and without passport. She's in a heap of trouble, I won't say what exactly, and even American extraterritoriality won't help her out.I mention that because one of the grievances that the Chinese including the bandits who attack the American mission in this story set deep in the Chinese interior was that particular institution whereby American citizens who committed crimes were tried by American courts set up by our consulates. We were far from the only country doing that however.Anyway the story opens with her on a train for Shanghai trying to use a hokey Russian accent.|1
Let's face it.This movie is incredibly cliché, as Korean romance dramas and movies go. First of all, there's a pair of long-lost siblings, one of which falls in love with the other. Second, there's a not-so-popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall for and fight over her. Third, one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease, which, eventually, takes his life.Still, I like this movie.Without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is engrossing--I honestly couldn't stop watching.|1
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's.|1
After being off the air for a while , Columbo returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that , while not much in the works , were important to him. In his new book, Columbo's story was inspired by George R.R. Martin's novel about his life in the 1920s and '30s in which he was both the protagonist, and as a result of Martin's involvement in a murder, Columbo was arrested by police in 1946 for the murder of an American sailor. Columbo went to trial a few times over his life. It was Martin's verdict against him that sparked the end of his career.|0
There are movies that are so bad, they're good. Then there's movies like Rest Stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.Bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. I can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all I really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all.|1
I usually seek to find good in movies , even the bad ones.Unfortunately this movie is one where I fail at. I have used it for movies like this one and I was very disappointed with it in the end. I do like the fact that the protagonist of the movie is a pretty decent actress. But I do find it much worse in films like this one. So, what I do find wrong in these movies is that I think this movie is not as good as the one I have seen in many movies.|0
OK , this movie was n't good at all . Video games are n't what I would brag on if they did. But, in my humble opinion , this is the first I've seen that makes any kind of sense to me. The movie has a couple of major flaws and they didn't make the right decisions when they did. I guess they made something that they could be proud of anyway. I don't recall seeing any movies like it on tv in the UK. I'm a big guy.|0
"I'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie:#1 Angelina Jolie sex scene #2 Foley artist outdid themselves #3 plot was quite thick #4 DVD does includes trailers and chapter stops#5 no animals were harmed in the making of the movie #6 homages to blade runner through out the film #7 burning trash cans #8 funny guy with no legs #9 Voice overs by Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the film. #10 Sage advise, for example ""When you dine with the devil bring a long spoon""."|1
"well , what can i say . WHAT THE F * * K ? There really is n't much to say , only a few things i have learnt : i've seen it before in some of my classes , and i've read it before in my own classes and im not sure i can ever do what i've seen it as , so i will try to take this with caution , but thank you for your patience and your patience , and now , im so very very very sorry

I am sorry ,i am sorry ."|0
"I have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and each time I watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of 1960's-1970's era anti-war ""hippies"" living at large in New York City. This small group happens upon a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who has been drafted into the US Army for service in Vietnam. Despite their best efforts to dissuade him, Claude does eventually report for basic training in the Army."|1
I kind of like JAG . It do have it´s charm but lately it´s to much propaganda in it . I would not like JAG as it´s much propaganda, and I believe JAG is not what I have in mind to be honest, and I can see that , but you could not give me a single example . JAG have had this problem too . If you´re just looking for a good example about it . I am sure you have seen enough examples . I hope this can help . Thank you very much and I hope it can help . Thank You.|0
"This film has some flaws, and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening. Possibly the greatest film to show the direness within Fly-Over Country, ""Rolling Kansas"" is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody. Like life, it starts, it moves, and then it ends. A few attempts at humor are made, but everything falls very flat. The occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance.Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie."|1
"1931 also presented ""an American tragedy"", the original tale of ""who will he take up with, poor girl or rich girl"". this was a truly entertaining film. Babs stanwyck was a pretty as she could be, ditto sally blane. Monroe owsley, unmemorably played Babs's husband. i had never heard of him, but i thought he bore a good physical resemblance to bing Crosby of ""the big broadcast"" ('32), even a receding hairline and wingy ears. Ricardo cortez, the rich playboy with a heart of gold."|1
I only wish there was a grade lower than F to give it! i scored it a 1 in the vote tally.I am grading this not even as a regular film,but as a T&A film,and this is the worst,lamest,crappiest and most awful movie i've seen.the acting,story and music are all terrible,not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the T&A connisuer.it's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers.avoid this piece of trash at all cost!|1
This is a snuff movie . I 'm shocked it is even considered to be in the IMDb library . I think it shows that it's possible to edit some scenes on an MP3 record. I can't even read a file with a lot of data, it's hard to explain. I have to go through all the files and try and find them, but can't seem to find how to do this. In this particular case , I am working on finding all of the MP4 files I could use.|0
"I have read each and every one of Baroness Orczy 's Scarlet Pimpernel books . Counting this one , I am going to give you a quick look at the books . This is one of the greatest mysteries ever written , and there is something very special about each of them . For this reason I would recommend you not to read either of them for the first time. You will never get away with them , though, so don’t think you are going to enjoy reading them for years to come. There are two things about this series:

I first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995 , I dismissed it offhand. So I'm back! After spending several years working on it, I'm now finally back to it. This time, I can't wait! It's also the first time I've used it in an entire year! This was a big no-brainer to me, because I could get away with it every single day, but I wasn't going to wait until the year 2000 to get this one up and running. I'm pretty sure it won't come out on the way!|0
No matter what other people have said you ca n't review this movie without comparing it to the original , this is a great video and will be played again in some other theaters! I think it would be more accurate to say that this movie isn't a comedy or a film based on a book. You don't need to look at it in order to understand the premise. This was made in 2008 and I can't believe it is over. I have seen it before and know how it works and how it works on screen, and I know how to make it look great.|0
I saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. Its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, I alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. Though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. As it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt.|1
This movie has to be the worst film I have seen . There is a reason it was made to be a horror movie . I had seen it before, and I know I would never do that to any film. The movie I have seen has a certain amount of suspense, and the only thing I would really like is to see more horror than this . The movie that I have seen does a lot of bad shit. You can get it into your head, but after watching it you know what you’re missing .|0
Awful in a whole new way , ANYTHING BUT LOVE probably should be seen by movie buffs -- if only they would have seen it at least they'd have been able to watch it again, and maybe have seen it once more. That's not quite what you mean. And I mean it. I'm glad that you're thinking of it. It might as well have been just a movie you watched for fun, and not a lot of stuff you would have liked to watch. That's just how the rest of the world works, and it just hasn't been fun to watch.|0
This movie is really bad . The hero ca n't play . You see too much that he learned his way around and can't get away with anything. He is going to kill his friends and his family because he's got an easy life. It is not like his mom is going to be able to help him too, and if he is able to find a solution, he can come back home and take his revenge. This movie has been in theaters and in movies since 1995. There are some scenes where he has to work around his own life because of his lack of interest in family.|0
I was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when I first saw it I was only mildly amused! I must say however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor wasn't given a bigger and better role! He was an enormous talent.There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matthau has never been funnier.I am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see Lemmon and Matthau team up for the very last time; in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use.|1
Not all movies are Oscar worthy but let's face it, sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one left me smiling and happy and I couldn't wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has had a pet (no matter what type) knows what it feels like to lose one. I believe most people would identify with Buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great as the tycoon turned nice guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother.|1
While caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in the entertainment industry, it is one of many things that come up in the entertainment industry. It is very important that you understand the various aspects of the entertainment industry in a given location so as to keep your product/industry in your mind. You will want to know just how big your product/industry will be. If you do not understand these details, we have no need to worry! How big should you sell? You need to decide what is a fair market value for your product.|0
Sweet , rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of her we're not done here. And it's all about the girl. She'll get a bit too close to the edge and get too close to the edge. In the middle of her life-long crush on him is a pretty good girl. And what can she do about that? Maybe she goes out with someone else. That way, he won't get too close to her or he won't have anything to worry about.|0
"I seriously don´t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. Sure, it´s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don´t think that the people who hated ""Heaven´s Gate"" really understood it. ""Heaven´s Gate"" in its uncut form, much like ""The Deer Hunter"" shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled ""Americans"" in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue)."|1
Maybe we Aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here. I have a database of all the DVDs I own (including those received as gifts - which this was) and so, when entering a new one, I always refer to IMDb for such info as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. When entering this, I noted that it was a comedy and so I decided to watch it at a time when I wanted something light and a good laugh. Well, it was neither!|1
"I really enjoyed this movie. I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, Im still stirred by the rousing rendition of Anchors Away! I also love the ""McHales Navy"" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer but Im just old fashioned I guess. She was still good to look at, lol, espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. The cook, sonarman, and electrician made the movie. Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO too."|1
It's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. It certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all-star cast. These days it's shown much too frequently on Fox Movie Channel or AMC.It pains me to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty, none of which rings true. It's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a Saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog.|1

A group of environmentalists travel to an island to uncover a secret lab that is experimenting on animals . When you turn your gaze to another group you’ve stumbled upon a story about their research. This story is about animals. It's about human biology. You can find a lot of animal stories about science related to animals, but the one that's most relevant is about human biology. This is a story of evolution. The story is about a team of researchers. In this story, the scientists are a scientist, who has a science degree and a PhD in biology.|0
Recently I borrowed a copy of this mess of a movie , which took me three sessions over three days , I decided that I am going to read this mess of a few years ago . I have read this movie before and I agree with your opinion . I have tried many times to read the movie before and have never read it. But it is still amazing . I want to go back and read it in time. (If you want to read it, look for a movie which is available online ). It will be my favorite movie for me to watch .|0
The Priest , into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love , but the process of love. In love, the human heart is the foundation, the foundation of the human heart , and the foundation of all human life in the earth and the sky . . . . When we are in love, there are many things that we have to work toward . . . . But when there is no love in our heart, when love is impossible, when we do not have a will to love and when we do not pursue our desires, we begin to be selfish .|0
The movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its cast and crew to make the story all the more important and compelling. It will have fans looking back on it with great excitement and interest, and it's also a terrific read for a young, talented director who has the ability to create a story that is both entertaining and entertaining with just the right amount of detail. And if you are a fan of The Last Airbender, you should check it out.|0
"Think 'Charmed ' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture . A very large proportion of women over age 65 have been raped, so it is not the end of the story but the beginning. It is also very interesting to see the difference between male and female body shape when viewed from a different angle

This was posted on September 22, 2015 at 10:41 am. To be clear, I have never heard of a man being raped by a woman without her consent. I just don't find this to be so."|0
Something of a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Garments in New York. His partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the scariest scene in the film.Cobb doesn't know it, or doesn't let himself realize it, but the man behind the killing is Richard Boone, who protects the business from union organizers.Then Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from Europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop. He's shocked -- shocked!|1
I remember the events of this movie, the ill fated cruise of Donald Crowhurst in 1968, in the Golden Globe single handed around the world yacht race. I was a 13 year old, living in England. The previous year Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis; he was knighted for his exploits) had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. I remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return (on a grainy black and white TV!) and then his knighting by the Queen. It provoked a huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the UK.|1
"I rented this one by accident. I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought ""shameless Blair Witch rip-off"". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I grabbed 'The Francisville Experiment' thinking it was something else. My horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer. Boring Characters, bad acting, and a feeling of 'we saw the Blair Witch Project and could do the same' permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits."|1

"Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting (Heather Graham could never live this down... it has three titles for a reason- to protect the guilty! ), beautifully bad dialog (""Do you like... ribs? ""), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! My roommate rented this under the title ""Terrified"" because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits. Not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this turd on a movie reel.Horrible movie."|1
The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts. You must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes. You must know the story through various other reviews, so lets speak about what is brilliant about this movie.Firstly, the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities. The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way. The second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance.|1
I really enjoyed this movie . I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it more than anything else I've done . I can't help but think I should stop there . I have really enjoyed it . My friend and my family . We are all so close , so close but not very close. I love movies like this . So far I am really enjoying the movie . I am so excited for next few years . I've never watched a movie before . But I really like this movie . My friends and I .|0
"My website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time. Here is an excerpt: ""If I were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, I couldn't imagine Hell being any worse. Jim Varney plays a three-handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world (apparently starting with cinema). Now let's face it, no one expects a whole lot from a Varney movie, but this agonizing drivel had me dry-heaving for 92 minutes. Not a laugh. Not one."|1
This movie is very modern and forward . It is about 75 % in English . It is aimed at children . In other words , it will be good . This is the movie, it is very interesting . It is for a very young girl and she is the one with the love of her friends . The story will be written in English . The movie is based on a novel , it is about her and her family . In it, the story is based on the story of the author. I have watched this film , I have seen it in France.|0
The portrayal of the Marines in this film is spot on . The action scenes are some of the best I have seen in years. The first one is for the Marines as they travel to the coast to work. After arriving in New Jersey, they head to Afghanistan where they shoot for the American Legion. Next thing I know they find themselves in Pakistan. The film begins with them getting attacked by Taliban. Then they come back home and they shoot again in Afghanistan. Then they are captured and put into prison. Then they head back home and they take their families there.|0
"This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one . `` THE HOLLOW '' is a great Hercule Poirot film. I know it was written for a movie like ""The Hunger Games,"" but I've been thinking of it in my life for years. My dad and my mom both used this movie for their summer camp, but that's not how my family was treated. Like I said, a lot of people would say it's the best one out there. But it's true to say that it's one of my favorites. It is."|0
"This is a very strange film, with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. It uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of Creepshow in that it introduces a trilogy of so-called ""horror"" shorts and blends them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus. There is a narrator who prattles on about relationships, but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well.."|1
As Muppet movies go , this is easily and clearly the best . It features loads of cameos by big names such as David Letterman, John Wick , Michael Myers and Peter Jackson in the movie as a whole. Its a fun movie and there are many great actors in the movie as the movie's characters are portrayed very differently from the actors in the film. And if you don't watch Muppet movies , then you don't understand what the movies are actually like and don't really know what it has to do with the movies itself.|0
I will commend it in only one respect .. it was innovative . Innovative does n't mean it 's a bad thing when you're going to give it a chance . It should have been made to look good . In the first place , it should not have been a perfect product. Secondly , it should be looked at as a better alternative for people who want to build better products . It has got a great look as well . It's not a bad thing to build as you can't do anything about it .|0
From the beginning of this film , with it 's `` The Lost boys '' rip off opening sequence , there is nothing to be gained in the opening credits line , and only a few things to be learned about it , the title credits line comes right after the beginning of the track , and in the credits sequence is a story of two different characters who have a long friendship that begins in the second half . The title of this film is actually `` The Lost Boys,'' and that the two characters are related in the film to each other.|0
And so it started with `` Shreik '' a send up of horror films , then we had Scary Movie'' which was what was on the menu then. For the next 5 years (2005-2008) we tried and tried but not that much, I guess. Now, what happened next was when I was making Scary Movie, was trying to decide if the Scary was a horror movie or something similar. I found out that it is. But there were problems with it because it was in an older release that was coming out. So, I decided to stick with the older releases for now.|0
"Had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called ""Half Empty."" I usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest Sequel, or Prequel that Hollywood throws at us. This was DIFFERENT and surprisingly  SO MUCH more entertaining than anything Hollywood spends millions advertising. When my husband and I go the movies, we go to be entertained  and ""Half Empty"" did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it."|1
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River , near Shasta when this movie was being played. I am a very serious man but I don't feel that I am in the same boat that my friends are. Well, I am a man that knows what it takes to be successful, so I wanted to get into it and play some of the shows. Last night was the best part of my weekend at the film and was the first time I saw a movie in over two years. I was so impressed by this movie that I was so excited when I watched it on Saturday.|0
I tried watching this movie , but I did n't make it past the first 15 minutes . It 's really hard to watch it in 10 minutes . I know this is a very good question , but I'm hoping someone can help me with what I have to say. My problem is I want to show you the main scene of the film, it's only the opening scene and not the ending. I'm sure most of the time when I watch it as I am so tired I don't know if I'll be able to see it again in 10 minutes .|0
"In yet another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called ""Women Who Kick Butt"", but even in its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role. Actually, during most of the movie Tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead, and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him! There is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie."|1
Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. I won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I never been a great fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because I search for one like this in vain!|1
Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were remarkable. The movie is less about the raw science of Darwin's beliefs, and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family, primarily his wife, Emma, and daughter, Annie.Toby Jones gives a wonderful turn as Thomas Huxley, the great defender of Darwin's beliefs, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Bettany and Connelly.But it is those two who carry the movie. Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end, but develops transcendence as Darwin grapples with his demons.|1
The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class.|1
This was a great film in every sense of the word . It tackles the subject of tribadism in a way that we've never been taught or seen as a subject in a film before (though it does make it look like they were trying to keep the film interesting). It even has some of the worst stuff in the films that you could think of. It takes the form of a story, a short-story, and an episode where the subject is treated as a subject. The film does make it look like a film about people and events.|0
... but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here. It's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouth.From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Don't Look in the Basement plays it subtle, which makes for superior suspense. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us do like subtlety!|1
Even my five year old was bored.Very predictable , and overacted . This movie could n't make up it 's name . This movie had a few things right - It was funny but it was real. This was not the best movie but it worked . The only reason to keep watching it was because it was funny , and that was the reason why it was funny . It would have been funny if it were real . This movie was real , and was real . I liked it but I can't really explain the story , I thought it might have been more funny and more real and had a good ending.|0
Now, the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films (House of the dead 2, All souls day, etc.) but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor/writer and now director, Bruce Campbell, you get one of the best damn made for TV independent horror films ever made! I normally hate these movies, in my previous review, House of the dead 2, I could not believe how horrible the film was! But somehow I took a liking for this film, a very good liking for this film.|1
"I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS!!! !This 16mm disaster is full of clichés, stereotypical characters, a generic, over done ""plot"" and terrible dialog.In this ""Movie"" we have the Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian ""hacker chick"", the Pedophilic teacher...Blah, Blah, Blah....And then the Pumpkin Man. ""Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?"" This question is asked towards the end of the film."|1
Don ` t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of THE TIME, we should have seen the movie, but when the film is about to start we should have realized what happened in the movie. The reason that the film is not being released in the U.S. is that the film was not being released in Canada. If you read the U.S. and Canada DVD releases, you can see that the film was being introduced in Europe in the first week of June, 2004. However, the first week was only four months after release.|0
The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French `` Emmanuelle 2 . '' This amazing work is composed entirely of pictures in which Laura Gemser played a part, and all of her scenes were filmed on camera in front of the camera. (In the original French translation, this work was called » l'homme d'homme. ») According to French law, pictures or text in which the author is writing are not included in the French language in which the story takes place, and so they cannot be reproduced in French.|0
I am currently watching this movie and I have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now . The acting is excellent but the dialogue is just so bad . I will also watch this one again for a good reason . But then, it is very difficult to judge . I will watch it again for a very, very long time . I have just read that the first movie was made in a dark period of the movie. If you are like me (or are watching this again) who would you actually watch? I find that the dialogue is just terrible.|0

So the girls need to be really careful when they see a beautiful girl with nice clothes and a good smile . She just needs to know when her friends ask her what she wants , and she 'll be a great friend of the girls . I know her friends know she wants her to come home and tell them everything about her . But it also needs to know what kind of people she is .|0
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. Now it’s been restored, with all of its modern elements restored, and it’s been used on many more occasions. The film has been shown at many exhibitions over the last twenty years. The film’s name is in English translation. This film is a sequel to the 1980 film and the original was produced by EMI Studios in 1990. There have been some changes to make it more accessible to the general public.|0
In America, the Jewish Jonathan Safran Foer (Elijah Wood) collects personal belongings of his family for recollection. A few moments before dying, his grandmother gives an old photograph of his grandfather with a woman called Augustine in Ukraine. Jonathan contacts the Odessa Heritage Tours, a family agency in Ukraine, to guide him to the location where the picture had been taken to find Augustine, and together with the interpreter Alex (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather and a weird dog, they travel in an old car searching the missing past of Jonathan's family.|1
Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director , but he has made some important strides on the world of journalism in recent years, so let’s take a moment to consider his current work and to give the context to what he hopes to be like in the news. After a short stint as a news editor in New York and New York City, Clark now works as an editor at the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle and, as he puts it, has made several news stories that have garnered him acclaim for what he has accomplished in the past decade.|0
Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema , and it 's way better than I expected . I was hoping to play it out the way you've done it before, but it is not so well done. I'm going to give you an idea of what I'm aiming for. The main thing I'm looking for is a little bit more in-game content. It sounds like a very good idea, and I've had quite some time to review it and I'm glad to have that started.|0
Excellent story, wonderful acting, amazing production values and a cool, action-packed short with a perfect twist at the end. What a great short film! I saw this film in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around - for a short film, this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time.AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film - for any film actually.|1
Does anyone else think that `` Reba '' is basically a ripoff of `` Roseanne '' ? Just look at it for a moment. 1. I think it would be a good idea to include `` Reba '' (which is just a name) when you are trying to explain things to the people doing it, but I can't seem to figure out how to do it without using `` Reba '' or anything else. I'm not sure I'm sure if it's a ripoff of what you mean. Maybe if you include `` Reba '' to explain things, then you will get some of the correct information.|0
OK, so this is a complete rip off of the first Karate Kid. However, I think there can never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There's something about this type of story that particularly seems to apply to people like me. You get a overall sense of being able to overcome adversity by finding out new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a particular gem as the Next Karate Kid. You can really tell that she has a bright future ahead of her.Not to say this movie is not without it's problems.|1
"Jennifer Montgomery 's `` Art for Teachers of Children '' is a stunning , disturbing masterpiece . Montgomery 's gritty portrayal of the children's education system is deeply unsettling to watch . It is deeply disturbing and disturbing to learn that Montgomery was one of the first authors of children's education . But the book was not just a child's education book . It was also a textbook for a family. How Montgomery was described in the first book as a book about the ""childhood"", but also ""a very interesting book for children""."|0
James Stewart plays Johnny Mason, lawyer. Carole Lombard is Jane Mason, wife. Lucile Watson the mother-in-law Harriet Mason. Johnny sees Jane and quickly marries her. Mother is disappointed. Mother lives with them. Many troubles are ahead. Jane can't cook. Can't set the table. Can't do many things according to mother. The interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film. Stewart and Lombard are married but just don't have any real magic on screen. Stewart is Stewart. He is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn't carry the film.|1
All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski's movies, I really do. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But this, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies, that tried to be good. But this was hardly even funny...I mean, I guess it was, because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It looks...terrible. And the movie has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming qualities. It is rated PG-13.|1
I won't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then, things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey who is trying to cope with a new step-brother, Derek, and his loud, crude family, while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them.In season 1, the story was actually interesting. I liked Casey back then because she was smart, strong, independent, and conservative. She was well-mannered and deep. I felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step-brother.|1
"This movie took me by surprise. I first saw it more than 10 years ago, and it stays with me still. It's got it's just plain boring points, and I, personally, would have ended it differently- this has not in the least bit discouraged me from watching it over and over and recommending it to others. The acting is _fantastic_. The cast and director do an amazing job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, ""What the hell is this?"|1
I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I did n't stop to consider that this might have something to do with it, so to the point where I don't know if it's worth the risk I'm likely to use it in an argument - I'm not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that it happened in the first instance - it's a pretty small thing - and maybe it's just the way I do it, but the truth of it is that it didn't happen in a very specific time frame, and it's worth remembering.|0
1) Bad acting.2) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background.3) Terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left, right and center.4) Cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie)5) Interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching Space 1999 a lot). Too bad it blows up so early. The escape ship also got sunk too fast.|1
"Sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says `` stay away from this movie '' . We want to tell you exactly what is on the screen. We want to talk to you and you say that you are scared of this movie. But it is your story. You're telling us what you want to talk about and it is the movie that is on your mind. And we want to get you to understand the movie on its own. The movie which is not on the screen. ```

You want to talk to the audience."|0
What could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! The last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! The acting talents of the likes of Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie.|1
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.I thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act!|1
"I found this an awfully disappointing experience! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.This ""Felicia's Journey"" is intriguing. It has drama. But it is full of stereo-types! So it ONLY serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth, beyond black 'n' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of ""NEWS"" that dot our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! It is SO EXAGGERATED, it reminds me of the fairytale of ""Little Red Ridinghood""!"|1
What has Rajiv Rai done to himself ? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now one of the most famous directors in India. Rajiv Rai is now an icon of Indian cinema, and yet he is still known for directing films in other languages. His work in Hindi has attracted a lot of attention in the past couple of months, especially when Rajiv Rai started his career with the role of Raghuram Rajendar, a Tamil film director from the Indian National Congress (INC). He was named as one of the top directors of Tamil Nadu in 2017.|0
"The third entry in the ""Stepford"" franchise, but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down, whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I haven't seen either the early 80's ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives"" or the mid 90's ""The Stepford Husbands"", but this ""The Stepford Children"" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film. It's basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree."|1
This is just one of those films which can not justify much of anything that happens . These people are all in the business of money. It's not worth the expense of putting up the money to get that money. And that makes it less expensive . . . . . I don't think that's all, but I do think there are a lot of times where a lot of people want to do more than their money, and to do that there are a lot of people who go into this business and say that, I think, I don't know what you are talking about.|0
To paraphrase the previous reviewer 's comments , if you 're a Stooges fan , avoid this one at all costs. I'll have to try it out myself. I haven't got much to do today so I'd hope I'll stay at work for a few days. But I've been on the run from all I did, and I've taken the time to read everything I've read in the whole time. So if you're looking for an explanation why I think I can do better without it. I'm going to start with this.|0
Sorry about the `` extremely clever '' summary phrase . I do n't know what I was thinking , but I think what you're really trying to say is that you're asking me to say something to convince me that you know something, or that you believe it. You can say something to tell me why something exists, but you only ask the question, not the answer. You don't do that to convince me the other side is right, or that there's a reason for what you're saying is right.|0
"So unfortunately me and my mate watched this!!! It was showing on a Sky channel over here called ""Zone Horror"" which basically shows crappy B-movie horror films 24/7. It was a boring Friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look. Apart from the atrocious acting, the awful plot, the dire effects, the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing ridiculousness of it all, it was OK, LOL!!! In all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors."|1
`` The Man From Utah '' opens with a singing cowboy strumming a guitar on horseback . This is how he's done, and it looks good for a time, as you can find the guitar in the front yard of this place. He doesn't have any idea what a guitar like this would be but that's okay, because it's very nice. There are many nice things here, and there are many great things to see and do and things that he would want to see happen as well as he does.|0

I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering `` The Dain Curse '' . My latest story as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering ' The Dain curse'' . My new stories as an extra and were at the hotel. This is how it happened: I got into the hotel at 5am on July 1, 2016, and arrived at the front door. I was looking for the hotel entrance and got into the hotel, and saw that it was a hotel. It turned out that I was in the wrong room and that I'd got into my hotel room too.|0
* * Spoiler * It gives away the very irrelevant ending * * At the beginning of this movie , we see all kinds of different ways you could have made it look. * * * [1:00] * * What's your name ? [1:05] * [1:06] * On the way out from your house , it's a really interesting movie , because at the end of the film , we get to see you in the balcony of your apartment , because we've seen all kinds of different things to make your balcony look different .|0
This movie is truly unbelievable , in every sense of the word . I could n't believe what I was seeing , in the movies and on TV in general . What a brilliant film , a masterpiece of genius. And I couldn't believe I watched it , I just have to give it a go now ! When I see a movie like this on TV, I feel like it will be the most beautiful film I own . I'd be really excited if I was able to do such a great job with a movie like this !|0
I've seen all 3 now. I just can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison to the others, but simply on it's own merit, or lack of. I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thought provoking and beautifully done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number was available, I would have given it that rating instead. What a total waste of time it was watching this movie.|1
Asmali Konak has arguably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. Personally I do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor) but I guess the figures speak for themselves.In relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. Years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series.|1
"The St. Francisville Experiment claims ""this ain't no walk in the woods"", a direct slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overworks the viewer's patience. One must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.Warning: Spoiler is forthcoming! !I viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's ""paranormal consultant"" Troy Taylor spoke about the making of the movie."|1
Conquerer of Shamballa shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want . I want to hear what they think about this one but it seems a lot of what they have been saying for many years have been ignored by the creators of the anime. The premise behind this story is that the creators of an Anime don't understand their fanbase. If they understood that, they might not be able to create their own story. Instead, the creators of the Anime have decided to be the one that has the power to change their lives.|0
Just a few words: it's a good thing George A Romero is still among us cause if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' And the saddest thing of all is that I actually agree with these people's sentiments. Yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave: to vote. Oh, and one of them finishes off The Doctor from Startrek Voyager. That's about as scary as it will get, people.|1
If this movie would have been in English , all critics would have trashed it . The language is extremely poor , and in fact, all the critics would have trashed it as well as any other movie the movie could have produced, if it had been translated . It doesn't even have any English, as far as we know . I am not sure that it's an actual adaptation, but I think its an actual adaptation , but I would guess that it's not much better . It would have been translated in any language that would have been good to translate as much as possible .|0
"I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It is so boring. The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background. My friend and I just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other, ""What's so funny?!!"". Seriously, every time we watched that show, you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing. Just a blank look. So we stop watching it."|1
Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos etc...How do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one token black.|1
This movie was pathetically awful. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating. If you have a life don't see this movie, cause you will want to kill yourself. This movie totally rips off Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie...or trilogy I should say).I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just horrible. I watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is. I actually don't know why my family is still watching it...oh wait, yes I do.|1
"FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team , to try and help the government investigate possible collusion of the Russian Federation into the Russian interference in the construction of nuclear power plants in Alaska , Alaska’s biggest oil town. In a statement on Friday, U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee chairman John McCain said: “The United States and Russian Federation will continue to cooperate in this investigation.”

But it would be difficult for anyone to believe such a thing will be happening, he said."|0
I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid and it scared the ever-dole eyes out. The movie starts with a scene between a man in a compromising situation and a female in a compromising situation who is trying to make the situation out to be worse. The scene begins, and the man starts laughing at the female. This scene is great, especially when the female takes the stand to help her friend, as she wants to do the best for the other guy, and the woman does as well.|0
I disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance . I ca n't imagine a stoner movie like this ever would. This is the kind of flick you would watch in person for a couple of years . But it does not appear so much because it's not for you. What the hell did I do? I don't care if I saw the trailer, I just wanted to find out for myself what I did with my life, because it didn't seem to me what a stoner movie was for me.|0
I started off being interested somewhat in the movie. It appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. Alas, it didn't hold up.I need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. Too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know this was not supposed to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in script and characterization.The acting was alright, the writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed.|1
I'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I do not connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. That disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. Although because of the poor story flow, I'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. The story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on.|1
"This telecast of the classic musical ""Sweeney Todd"" does not do the production justice, but is still quite enthralling.Firstly, the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design, from the wheeling multi-set to the startling trapdoor. Then, the staging is excellent, right down to the slashing.The main failing here is in the performances people give. Oh, they're believable, all right-- but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fast-paced as, say, ""Kiss Me."""|1
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it's best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines, filled with ethnic slurs and awful language. Sex toys included!There should be more comedy like this around today. This collection of sketches on one DVD will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoyed The State and/or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for some more glory.|1
"I remember watching this movie on TV a few years back. It was so bad, I can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. The only plot summary I can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high. (Spoiler alert starts here...) When the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the ""Demon Cop"", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a Halloween costume gone wrong. A car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running."|1
"The story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered ""valley girl"" who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives. What a great and worthy story line. But in this telling the screen writing and/or directing and/or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet, and for what purpose?"|1
"I really liked the Far Cry game, nice graphics, good level-design, interesting and clever enemies, above-average length and even a somewhat decent plot. I am not by default against movie spin-offs of games. I thought ""DOOM The Movie"" was hilarious. But what Uwe Boll has done here, is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible (well not the length, the movie runs only a merciful 90 min) The characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is quite an achievement."|1
Steven Segal has done some awful films , but this is probably one of the best since his career took place in the late ’50s. I can see why so many people have come forward to say they would like to see the movie “S.E.’s ’60” and that the film is better if it doesn’t take its story to a new level. This is where the ‘50s started. A number of major films from the 1950s and early 1960s were good. One was “Ozark” which was a big hit.|0
"Now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (Vampires, martial arts, a techno beat, top-o-the-line special effects, etc. ), and turns it into something that feels brand new. In what could have easily been merely a combination of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,"" Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of ""Passenger 57"") gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker."|1
"I 've watched the movie actually several times . And what i want to say about it is the only part you should watch if it is really interesting. So i have to say, that it has been very successful . And i hope that my experience will be improved . Thank you so much for the help. A:

If you're asking whether your movie will be bad, it will probably be good. You will also want to look at the movies that you've watched on Youtube and watch the videos."|0
Why would anyone make a film like this ? Why would anybody invest in a film like this ? Why wouldn't people do this ? What are the steps they take ? What is a film like this ? How many ? What would you do if people didn't have any films like this ? Are you going to buy one ? When should I buy one ? If I am going to buy anything, what do I want it to be? How many films can I put in one that I can afford, and it won't cost me a fortune?|0
"i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).Just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.It's not even scary. It's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this...""thing"" to trick movie fans. I guess big producers make whatever they want.Just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get ""The Nun"".And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible!!!"|1
"Okay, so I love silly movies. If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, i would go see this movie. This movie is all that i wanted it to be. Being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. Every time i thought to myself ""this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen...."" then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. It's a wonderful silly 'b'-movie."|1
when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE, Which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. I don't even know what to say the acting blew, the fire looked really fake, Andy the chicks are'nt exactly supermodels. And lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me Well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2. And to make things worse i have the whole set on DVD fire,volcano,earthquake,avalanche.|1
"""The Journey"" is a romantic version of the cold war. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards, Jr.), out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956. She's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border.Of course, the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officer-in-charge (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr)and delays the trip."|1
"HOW MANY MOVIES ARE THERE GOING TO BE IN WHICH AGAINST ALL ODDS , A RAGTAG TEAM BEATS THE BIG BEGINNING

It is one thing to love the movies, it’s quite another, when people get a chance, they go for it, and that is not how we want them to be or what we do with our life. So when the time is right, we need to make the right move for all these people, they have to do it to succeed. There is no better analogy for life than the one that you can make for your own."|0
Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. Now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.Yea, basically that's the short of it. There's more to it than that, but I still have no clue what it is. The only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as I was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. I'm also confused as to whether or not it's in English.|1
You Belong To Me was the final teaming of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for Fonda to Columbia Pictures. Fonda had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox in order to get the Tom Joad part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at Fox.But the rule was broken here. Though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this film isn't anywhere near as funny.|1
( The beginning might be a spoiler ... ) '' The Eye 2 '' is the sequel to `` The Eye 2'' but it doesn't have anything in it that makes it fun. I don't see any reason why they could make a better sequel to the original (I think we could make a better sequel if they made some more twists). They're just not showing up in their latest release, so I don't know how many people would see it on the net. I know that they're going to make a few new features for the series, but they're not making a sequel.|0
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff . One of the greatest movies of all time ! There are so many of us on the front lines of anything, and we are all trying to make a difference in the lives of those who care for us. I am no stranger to the truth in this genre, so I am glad to be able to speak my mind to it. That’s where the fight comes in. We have fought on the front lines of war. We are all trying to make the world better for everyone, but we are all doing the wrong thing.|0
This movie is amazing. You will NEVER laugh harder. It's a target. No, I think it's...yes it's...A BOOB! This movie gets funnier by the second--like when Jackie Chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene. This movie is velly velly seekwet like treasha! Congrats if you buy or rent this. You'll never return it, in my opinion. I didn't, and I haven't found it in a store since. I watched this movie once and I was forever in love with Kung-Fu action flicks.|1

Thanks for making the site accessible, you are the expert who did everything possible for us to ensure all were done in a very professional manner. If we can come up with a solution, we will gladly give you more details and we will take care of it! We would like to thank you for giving us the chance to help with our project.|0
I won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating, plenty of other people have already done that. Suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that I've owned on DVD, this is the ONLY one that I got rid of- it was so worthless that I couldn't see ever wanting to watch ANY of it again.However, I do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). While skimming through the 4 pages of reviews I saw no rating higher than 3 stars.|1
A lot of 'alternative ' comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular , misguided , overly-political , and unfunny , but that's about all. There's still a great amount of talent to be gained in a world dominated by an uneducated, conservative elite, but that's all gone. It's all gone, I suppose. That's not to say there aren't other people who do it for free. The world is more complicated and interesting than ever. This is a very sad story, actually. It is a very very sad story.|0
This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Few movies can actually give me chill bumps. This one did. Few horror movie give me a sense of dread. This one did. It kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I cared about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. It becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. It does.|1
With a cast like this, I knew the acting would be amazing. Still, I was cautious, as I always am of sequels. Would it sustain the feeling of the first film? Could they possibly replicate the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of Ocean's 11? We'll never know, because they didn't try. At least, not in the way I expected. Instead, they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre. If you want a gripping, logical heist, don't watch this.|1

Sheltered young woman , home-schooled and possibly quite gifted , harbors a disturbed , overly-emotional side which comes to the rescue of her daughter , and who is not a good mother . In the past year , she has gone from being a little shy of her own self-discipline, to a little over the top . She has had to learn a couple of things , and for that she is grateful. She has been told to take her kids to the local park instead of the town park to play volleyball , and she has also had her own family to go to school.|0
"Went to the Preview Engagement of ""Grand Champion"" today (Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are so few movies suitable for young children...but this one is, and it's great. Though the plot is a little ""Hokey"" (also the name of the steer in the movie), it is a wonderful story for children. And I enjoyed it, too. The film pretty well represents West Texas ranch family life, although a little exaggerated. Director/Author Barry Tubb ought to get it right since he grew up in that environment."|1
I saw this film via one of the actors ' agents , and it surely conforms with a great deal of what the film does. As you can tell, the director himself doesn't really care much, and has a much more important role than he would have. There's a lot of different aspects of the plot to this film, too, including what's going to happen on the street, what kind of characters are going to be in the movie, and why the action will happen in the neighborhood.|0
Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesuque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham.|1
This film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other . Henry May Long is a good example of that. It is about how the world works and how people learn to live the ways of the good, and is based on a real experience that was previously presented in real-life scenarios. Long, a writer and film maker, worked on the script and set, and has continued to do so, as well as working on the sound. Henry Long has also written several film-themed short films. Henry Long has been interviewed by several news organizations as well as his own family.|0
This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies . It may have been considered racy in its time, but it did not make it popular until the early 2000s. In 1998, it was broadcast by American Network for the Fox Television Company, which is now a division of the National Television Network and the United Network for Cable Television. The movie has been shown in the U.S.A. since 1996, when it began airing in the U.S. and Europe, before being airing in Germany in 2006. In the United States, the film has not made a broadcast since 1994, when it aired for cable in two parts.|0
Pretty twisted Horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy Blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good. All the characters are OK, and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull, however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. It's well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up the pace, plus I found the ending to be disappointing.|1
Definitely worth renting! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year-olds (and I) loved it. Kept them on the edge of their seats. I recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this, as it can be quite suspenseful for them. It's not too often you can find movies that you can watch with your children, and so this is a rare find. Some of the acting / realism isn't quite there at times, or maybe is a little corny, but children don't seem to notice or care, they love it.|1
I saw the trailer for this film before watching Titanic, and I must admit that it whetted my appetite. Volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But what a damp squib. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ludicrous. The stupid daughter is just beyond belief - she is supposed to be 13 not 4. But then the scientists,firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more. This movie ranks just in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because those 2 films are completely appalling.|1
Six out of seven people who took the time to comment on this movie have very positive responses . The trailer, which is in theaters this afternoon, comes as a welcome sign of the movie's popularity and is available on demand. If you're looking for any of the great films and shows I've watched on my own, I highly recommend The Wolf of Wall Street. And I've also read the trailer, which is available at Amazon on demand. I hope you find the film entertaining enough for you. The Wolf of Wall Street tells the tale of the world's biggest and richest man.|0
This movie was so bad it looked like a home movie . In one scene , the camera very slowly pans the scene to make it look like an actual film. As I got close to the movie it looked like the scene I wanted. It’s been the longest movie in history. So I had to see it again. In the movie, the scene is taken from the beginning of the film where I am standing right next to the camera where the person walking behind me and the camera was on the floor and I looked at him and it looks like a film .|0
I always loved this film . The music , story and the action . I especially love the opening and ending scenes . It was so easy to read the film so fast and well . I was able to read it by myself . I enjoyed the opening and opening scenes with the actors , but it is so hard . It is very hard for me to look at the movie at that stage . As I am watching it now I just feel so overwhelmed and confused as I have to read it all over again and I have so much I have to do .|0
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the film's time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another.The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines. Somehow, I didn't find him very believable. On the other hand, Robert Walker shines as sinister 'bad guy' Bruno Anthony.Overall, I would highly recommend this.|1
"I really wanted to like this movie. Great cast  Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic ""Forbidden Planet,"" Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is a guy on a submarine a sailor? ), even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks. Maybe it's a good kiddie movie but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was severely underused. I guess he was a red herring, like Pidgeon  you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank."|1
Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ``Eternal Life'' television show. Instead, the show ended with the cancellation of the second episode, which is one of our most popular live shows. This was the final episode of the first season and the third of last season. The show is well-received by television viewers, as we can see from the credits. It has a pretty good cast of characters, which we can imagine that they all do well.|0
Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube, I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short.|1
I 'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it back and sells it as a live thing and then the studio has the right to put out an album on it and it can be put out for a year or more before it ever comes off as good as new. I can only imagine what they are going to do to this. When I first heard The Last Supper in the 90s I was just a kid sitting on the couch thinking how great it is to be a musician.|0
The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick . Sadly it 's just a small fraction of it. The only downside though is that they have the VHS title and are only available at the bottom of the screen so you won't have to buy them to see what I mean. That said I'd really love to see the title for a few more bucks as well as see what else they have in store for you. Thanks for reading and let's get to it again!|0
"I unwittingly walked into this ""trap"" of a movie.If I could turn back time or simply get a refund I would be happy.It was 7:30pm and Cinderella Man didn't start until 10pm so I rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm...and I dare say God reached out his hand (or retracted it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film.It may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort, however, there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing."|1
"A thinly veiled attempt to push Hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan . What could be worse than Hogan’s return to his home turf? As we mentioned, the wrestling game has always been a favorite part of wrestling history, and there are no wrong answers in any of those. But the most likely culprits to be involved include:

First, Hogan must be out of the picture for too long to do anything meaningful, since he and the rest of his staff don’t think he needs to stay at the helm for too long."|0
I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. But I can't defend this nonsense. Spoilers follow.The first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: So if Starbuck thinks she knows where Earth is why not send her out in a Raptor? Would the Admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the Quorum elect their newest member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust.|1
"This movie reeks. No money, no acting, no nothing. I caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. This movie has nothing to recommend it. I can't believe it ever got released to US television! Nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag. The lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face, the special effects consist of a worm-like handpuppet ""monster""... I can't even begin to tell you how rock-bottom this production is."|1
Yes sure, this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it. It's a good effort, the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems with the use of the camera, I can't see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people dislike this movie, I really enjoyed it.|1
"Throughout watching `` End of Days '' , I got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to do a similar thing. In fact, on the whole, I've found that they're just putting together a little bit more than they seem. It's not a question of if the films would make sense at all, but what do you think they would? I like the idea, but I'd like to know how many films would use it. Is there something else I can think of? A:

One of your favorite things is to watch the movie on a laptop."|0
Wow ... just ... wow . There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to give a couple reviews. I didn't really get into what I wanted to say, but I think that's what it's all about. We get into it like this because you just know what we're going to do with this movie as opposed to trying to make up the whole story. In fact, one of the reasons I liked it was to get the sense that this movie is very well done.|0
"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd...The strangest, most off-putting, but most wonderful Broadway musical. It is chilling, funny, and moving all at once through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. George Hearn is incomparable in the title role, bringing a strong voice and dead on (no pun intended) impersonation of the legendary demon barber, while Angela Lansbury provides the comic relief as she cheerfully grinds up his victims into meat pies. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, ""Sweeney Todd"" is a real treat."|1
Like the beauty of the jungle , Jessica Alba 's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film , which was also released in Australia on October 17th. Filmmaker and film student Jessica Alba is going to star in this romantic thriller. She has been making films since 1996 when her parents divorced and she moved to California. She is an award winning filmmaker, director and producer for the film which was released on October 22nd, 2017 and is the star of the film. Jessica's name was chosen for the film because the title means 'Love Story' in Spanish.|0
"I'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out. Rather, I usually run out and see it (If I had watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. But if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows, this is exhibit A (So you can actually say something more than just ""McHale's Navy""). ""Mod Squad"" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. At least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking."|1
After reading some of these reviews , it is apparent that some have missed the point . What is great about them is their depth . They are so short that they can barely hold their breath after a few paragraphs . If you look at the content , you will see that they have a very short body. In fact, they are more comfortable sitting on the ground than being inside a house . This makes the book a bit better than it is. It is a nice book with an interesting subject to discuss .|0
This film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be a boring one. It starts with a bad scene in an interview about how the world has fallen in love with America. When the American public begins to take their time and study the history of this place, I can only imagine that you wouldn’t have liked that. At the beginning of the second half of the movie, I think it starts out as a great joke that America is the most American country on Earth and that is exactly the point.|0
... but you probably have seen it or else you would n't be here . It 's so obscure that it's hard to believe.

^^contains spoilers^^This movie is utter crap . Do not watch.There is no one in this movie to root for , not a single one . The only people in this movie are the ones on this site. It was never intended to be any good . We are talking about The Last Stand . It was just a film, not a movie , not a video , not a documentary . The only movie in the world that is any good , is a movie . In the end the only ones to root for , are those who have a little love , or care, or care more than others.|0
I walked into Heart Of Gold thinking I was going to watch a documentary about Neil Young . Instead , I went on a walk with my partner and took a photo. We had to leave the house in the morning to get to the store. I walked past the store and my partner turned off the phone to take a quick photo. I went back to the car. The first picture I did was of my partner, so I thought we would go back to the store so we could go into the front room.|0
"This version of ""The Magic Flute"" is not only the worst production of Mozart's great opera that I have ever seen, it is also the worst video production I have seen of any opera.I'm a big opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. He is just dressed like some guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated in orange. Most DVD's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one."|1
A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also starring are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. Quite an impressive list of names. Unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development.|1
Creepy facemasks and slasher movies have gone together like cheese and chives throughout the lengthy lifespan of the cycle . The most famous of these are the “Duck the Dog” series of the 1990s. In the 1980s, it was the first animated series of this type and one of the most popular. It’s one of the biggest and most iconic children’s shows to appear in American cinemas and the first ever animated film made. There are dozens of movies to be seen this weekend and the one that everyone is waiting for is Duck the Duck.|0
This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on . This movie is practically McHale 's best friend for most of the episodes, but there are a few that have been taken seriously by some in the industry. He's a young man with a bright outlook, a lot of passion and a lot of courage, but in the end, I feel like he's very good in some aspects. McHale isn't in his best self-pity, but I really liked this character in the first half of the episode, where he's a nice guy with an easygoing personality.|0
"To my eternal shame, I've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies, ""Nosferatu"". However, if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then I'll probably try to watch a few more. This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies. The premise, such as it is, focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair)."|1
I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded , it talks of violence and what there doing , it seems the main part of your life , you may as well try it , it is an amazing movie and one that you have enjoyed so much but if you want to find out the best part of the movie and enjoy it you can always turn to my other article. As far as I can tell, this movie is an epic story but it is one of the best of the series and I believe it is the only one on that list.|0
I went to this film having no idea what to expect. I actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it.I only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non-mainstream movies. It's not as disjointed as Liquid Sky or as fanciful as Forbidden Zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There's A LOT of subtle humor.Here's a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost: A big-brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society.|1
It 's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir . There just is n't a good movie about it but I don 't see one but maybe I could help . When I first saw the first movie that I wanted to make about a year ago, I was really happy with the idea. I wanted to try the first one I saw in the film, and I think I had a lot to learn about what makes a good film. I tried out the first movie that I saw in 2012, and it just didn 't make me smile.|0
I 'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A . Not only do they sound as if they have the same flaws as the ones they have in their films, but they seem a bit more sophisticated in many regards and have more of the characterisation that their contemporaries did. I have reviewed the first three, the first three (A-G) and then the final two (B). Reviewing the A-G film is a little more nuanced than the other ones, and it's pretty hard to make that much of a difference.|0
An art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from gingko trees and puts it in his apartment, but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people.This beautifully crafted horror well, actually it's more fantasy/romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life. Problem was that I spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button.|1
Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the 1933 version , with some of the main characters appearing in the story. I really want to learn more about how this was developed, but there are a couple issues I don't know enough about. 1) I think it's an older version with an interesting plot, but with more character. I was surprised by this version because I was told it had a character with a longer story-line. 2) I'm not familiar with the original film and I have no idea if it even has a cast.|0
"This movie contains real animals been killed , like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been thrown into a sewer. If you look closely the pictures of the movie are as follows

The movie is about the snake and crocodyl (which is a real snake). 1. The movie is very realistic , like real animals seen in real life are not. The movie doesn't include any actual animals, like humans, or other animals that we do not know or understand. The movie can be used as a metaphor to describe a very realistic movie."|0
Low-budget murder mystery about a Public Defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the PD believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as the PD is okay, and James Anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense, and despite some good character actors in the cast, the performances are generally below par.|1
"This film is all right, fairly silly and to be taken lightly. But what I can't stand are the numerous heroes and that boy's ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL comment near the end: ""look, they all look the same"". Isn't that by far passing the good taste standards? I thought it was revolting, as were the heroic, unselfish acts by some of the people in this film. I'm not saying it won't happen like that, but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn."|1
"This forth film in the ""Angel Guts"" saga, which at only a few minutes above an hour (it just feels much longer) , is also the shortest, which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most uninvolving of the series.Nami, a department store clerk, is interested in another part time job. Her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called 'red porno'. But when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her. And she gets some unwanted admirer."|1
"I have some of the older videos and dvds of Dr. Who. I've played them over and over. I adore each of the ""Doctors"" for different reasons. But due to a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, even though it was still one of the mainstays of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor stayed alive through the fans. BBC graciously allowed fans to write books, and cartoons. The momentum of Dr. Who has been steady even after 1989. Then they took a chance with Paul McGann."|1
A horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered PC clichés ad nauseam ( races working together and working their way up in the next second). This is not a good time to put it in terms of a story that you can see all day but you can’t really tell from it because it’s not as well documented as you thought. One of my favourite stories of the day, the one I told the story of, is the story of what happened next, which came down to us.|0
"Gorgeous Annie Belle in her prime stars in this adventure/sex movie. She wears her hair in a buzz cut that is bleached platinum. She and her boyfriend are visiting some tropical Asian paradise. They have decided to keep an ""open"" sexual relationship, which is played out on their journey to find a secret society/tribe where the people live one year and then are reborn in some kind of ceremony. The scenery is gorgeous, deep vast green gorges and jungles are explored. The imagery is very similar to that of the movie ""Black Emanuelle"". It is rich and colorful."|1
"It takes an eternity for this typically over-simplistic and idiotic Stephen King-based film to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half-an-hour is spent on needless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that might excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soapy dramas, but this is supposed to be the horror genre (or so I naively thought). The mutt fails to look all that fearsome, which Leonard Maltin, the notoriously clueless/hopeless and always grinning film critic, would disagree with: he considers Cujo to be ""genuinely frightening""."|1
"My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening , thinking we'd watch it on the couch in bed for the first time . I thought to myself: ""why on earth have I watched it on the television?"" ""why is it possible for a married couple to have a TV watching on a TV?"" ""because the family is so close."" ""I asked him to give me this gift and I told him, ""You are my daughter. You are my mother."|0
"As a rule, I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them. I made no exceptions with ""Tart"", doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was. But no effort, no matter how great, could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie.It failed for a number of reasons. Firstly, the cinematography was directionless and ineffective. Secondly, the script reached depths of 'poor' that took it well and truly beyond the 'so bad it's good' category. Thirdly, the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling, it really was."|1
One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen . Since these are not characters in this story it would be hard to tell you anything about them, but there are a lot of parallels with gay characters in movies. You just have to wonder if there are any parallels with gay characters that you don't think there is in the films. The only thing to know is that they do have a certain style of character. And they have a lot of similarities. You have no reason to think the characters are gay or homosexual. They are not in the same way.|0
"Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play to him . I always liked his writing. (Image: AP) (Image: AP)

""I really don't know how to make the world work as it should be,"" he said. But I do know that this is the beginning of what might be called the modern era of writing: the idea that words have meaning and can make you feel alive and alive, that is, to feel alive and alive to the reader and to the reader of the writing medium."|0
This movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver. He meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. The group which is called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them. They rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene.|1
the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic , as the whole point of the programme was to give the players time to play their game. If there is a good way to give players time to go out and do their thing, then I suppose I would like to show you something that is more interesting than just giving your time. It would be better to let players take over for the remainder of the game and work in their own team instead of leaving the rest to the players, or rather give the players time to go out and have their fun.|0
I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and MOst importantly--not being LAME--, but i guess this was produced for those Sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''A good Movie''don't be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for ''once in a life time movies''.|1
This movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. This kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. I went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. Only thing I appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career.|1
"Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. Commercials try to show how unique and ""funny"" a show can be. Yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, I've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing, either.I don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness, cuteness or humor. The characters were insufferable for the most part. Especially Selma Blair's (which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this)."|1
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends. The acting was quite exquisite and I hope we'll be seeing both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles down the road...|1
"This is probably the only film I've seen where the IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. ""The Stupids"" is an atrocious, dim-witted film with absolutely no artistic merit whatsoever, and is a denigration to a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great.In order to appreciate ""The Stupids"", you have to keep in mind a little-known, but very true maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: ""I urge you to learn to look at bad films, they are so often sublime."""|1
"As a parent of two girls ( 14 and 11 ) I have grave doubts about this show and all my doubts are answered. However, a few things came of it:

I think that if you watch the series, you will be unable to tell if they are real, as there is not the time to learn to read a book. So it is best to start reading it immediately. You have already read the story, but you can skip it, and wait until you have to finish reading the story. The main characters are mostly female who play a role."|0
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations, Blade is by far one of the best realised, and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made, the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film.|1
Low budget mystery. A shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan(Chick Chandler)discovers a dead body that goes missing. The woman in a hurry, Mary(June Clyde), is linked to the death scene; but it is McMillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. Suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene. All the atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not quite the real thing. This flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery/drama and is a nice little escape.|1
I am a firm believer that a film , TV serial or any form of art should and would be treated with the same respect. However, if you are a filmmaker, you will be subject to many things, but I think it would be more important if the artist had the right skills, a style and attitude to make films that you would enjoy. I am not saying film is good but I think you should get good at making films for your audience. Film is the best medium in which to do your work and be successful, and it can be made in a variety of settings.|0
I liked this movie , the second Naruto feature film . I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad but not the first . It's a great movie , and it's good and the cinematography is better than the others and the film looks great . I enjoyed the story and the cinematography too , but not the story , just the plot . I didn't care for it. But I loved it . I don't remember how I felt about the first one . I like the second one . But not the first one . The thing I was not really aware of is how this movie ends.|0
I never comment on a film , but I have to say that this was one of the worst films to ever feature. You see, a lot of people wanted the film to be shot with a single camera, and it didn't work out. But I had to ask a question about that one. The problem was that I was too nervous to get out of bed and write. That was a huge pain in the ass for a film with the camera. I was so tired of not being a film director that I decided to stay up all night doing it.|0
I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas cop battles smugglers. This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you.|1
If you wish to have a truly traumatic experience , than this awful motion picture ( if you may consider me , ) shows how one of the biggest problems of human history can be seen from a modern day. I have read this movie before but my memory is somewhat shaky so I may give it a second look . But this is the best one I have read on this topic so please let me know if this one sounds familiar . Also, I will try and give it a quick review. This scene in the movie was a lot of fun to play.|0
I saw this last week during Bruce Campbell 's book tour . I thought it was amazing . Almost everything in it was amazing . I think I should have taken the tour with a few of the newbies. I was so happy that Bruce had done this one . But I've never really enjoyed Bruce Campbell . It was so refreshing . I was just so happy to be back in the city of London . I know I'd like to go to work with Bruce . The next few weeks I won't be able to because I'm feeling so tired .|0
"Do n't be taken in because the premise of this film is a good one . It is , but I think it's true . It does not look like a film that has to do with a specific film or feature . I think it will be one of the films that is to be taken in by some other film . And that is the way I see it ive been watching the movies since the 90s. And I've seen the movies before in many different ways . But . It's a good film. But it does not have a ""good"" movie."|0
OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. The original Psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. Where's originality?|1
"I really like the show ! ! As a part of Greek Life , I can say that some things are true, some are false. But for me I do not try to be different, I try to make myself interesting, to make my way around the world. That is the way of life. I love it! :)

So I am a bit surprised to see that I have not yet been told to write an entry, so I thought I would ask someone who might be willing to help me. 1) What type of work does the writer do?"|0
If you just want gore , and nothing but gore and torture , you 've come to the right movie for this. We love this movie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . When you want to scream and spit and spit and spit and spit and spitand spitand spitand spitand spitand spitand spityou have no way to stop it. The best and the most important thing to know about all of this movie is what happens inside the mouth when you spit a line.|0
"This is primarily about love in WWII , yet we must remember that it 's also a biopic for Dylan Thomas , a writer and actor in his time, who has done a lot of work in TV and film. He wrote some great books and was the author of many TV and film work. So I think I have finally reached the conclusion in my book about ""love"" and ""love-making"", and I have to admit I didn't think about it before, but now I think it's a great read. I love this book!"|0
I'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. However, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a Shelley Hack reference while on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a Charlie's Angels fixation at one time. Based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her Charlie's Angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what I've read here it was made around 1987.|1
It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film...Grand Champion. The story of a 12 year old boy (Buddy) that with the help of his sister, Mom and best friend is determined to raise a Grand Champion steer. It is a whimsical journey to the big competition. After Hokey Pokey is crowned, Grand Champion, he is auctioned for $775,000. to pay for the kids college education. Buddy finds out that the next time he sees Hokey....it would be on a bun!|1
"Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite A-list actors, fine cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot, and the plot is laughable. ""Teach me how to be likable"", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that about sums it up. We learn next to nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a fine actor, but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut-throat egoist the script depends on him to be."|1
a great movie, with a rather unclear political message. it´s shot in a theatrical style, i.c. most of the action takes place inside. mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. emotions run high since the western tourists and business-people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern-russian charm of the mayor, although he makes every effort to understand their point of view. the two opposite world-views are made pointedly clear, but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie.|1
Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin 's Dolemite . This is the single greatest piece of cinema. It's the single best movie of the modern era! I've had a hard time believing any of this, I've only read about one movie at a time, it's the best movie of the era. I don't watch it in the cinema. I have seen a lot of movies since it's in the theaters. It's like the most original movie of all time. I've never heard anything like that. I think I've heard of it.|0
"This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough . The acting and plot are n't that impressive , but the story is just the best in the world . The author of the book and the illustrator who wrote the story are both amazing people and a very good read. If you've ever watched the TV show ""Super Mario Bros."" there's this hilarious short film of the animated film called ""Manny B-1"". It was a great film that was very well received by everyone, but the director was very good and it was great fun."|0
"You can't really blame the movie maker for glorifying Che because the industry is all about money. Most of the stories you hear about this ""freedom fighter"" are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was a murdering scumbag from day one. Here's a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1) Executed thousands of innocent Cuban Men, Women, AND CHILDREN to satisfy his lust for power.2) Destroyed Cuba's economy and good standing with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso used to be equal with the American dollar."|1
I like The Wind and the Lion very much . It was a good movie . I thought that since you have been watching this show you were able to see how it was playing. But when you were watching the first movie, it was pretty clear how the character was supposed to be portrayed from the outside. So I guess you were watching the show for that. In my mind it was an adaptation. It took me some time to decide which movies to watch. I was trying to decide when I wanted to go.|0
Ho Hum. Just another flick with Steven Seagal pretending to be some spiritual being, but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing. He, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., How sweet. Lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl. Jeesh! This time, he is partnered with Ice Cool (Anthony 'Treach' Criss). Gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty.|1
"I watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, having just graduated college and moved on to ""real life"". I was not in a fraternity, but a lot of my best buddies were, and I got to partake in a lot of the partying that they did in their house, so I know what goes on to some extent.This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary in any way of Greek life, or college life for that matter, although it does hold a lot of truth, albeit exaggerated for the most part."|1
I just saw this movie for the second time. I first saw it back in the mid-90's as a Vanguard Video selection. It has retained it power.It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Two is it is a launching pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, it has Dennis Hopper in one of his better social misfit/psychotic character roles.The movie is also a study in the way people act in different settings. You have characters in one-on-one, family, peer group, school, general society settings, etc.|1
While caricatures and/or references to entertainment industry people or things or even brands of products is usually a staple in shorts like this one, they aren't used in quantity here. Most of the individual gags are rather generic. As I'm going to give examples, there will be spoilers below: There are only three (well, technically four-there's a quick one at the very end of the cartoon) caricatures that I spotted, which is kind of low for this type of short, though one is a featured character with a fair amount of activity.|1
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals , it 's a classic ! > Rita Hayworth is in top form , I was looking for the best song for it. This song has a good melody, beautiful guitar playing , great vocals and a great tracklist . A few songs are good too , these are my favorites ! > Good luck for this project! Rita Hayworth is one the best songs you have ever worked with in any music club, she has a lot of talent for songwriting, she can write a lot of songs and she makes a great team for her.|0
After watching this film, I thought to myself, they really glossed up Errol Flynn's life! The movie is really nice eye candy. They really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of Hollywood just right. The costumes were great. All the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair.Is this a serious film about Errol Flynn's life? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life.Why am I critiquing this film? This is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver.|1
Yeah , what did I expect ? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in the world. I thought I’d get some idea how it was supposed to sound like it was actually happening, but I was not able to take it from there – I tried to write a few thoughts down here on my blog. (I’ll share more about it in future posts). Now that I got my book on the way, it has some good reviews of some of my best books.|0
After having problems in Chicago , the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew , which is located a mile off the border . This farmhouse, is about two miles west of Milwaukee , just south of Milwaukee . The family plans to sell the farm as soon as it has enough room for the family , but we would like to hear from you . If you have any comments on the house , please leave a comment. I had a similar problem with my home for about a week, and when I moved I couldn't even get it up to 10, but then it went downhill .|0
`` Witchery '' is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn ! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one ! But if I could use a better title and name for this book then I would do that ! Thanks all for supporting Witchery ! If you have not read this before and want to support Witchery but haven't yet, I hope you'll take a look at the article about Witchery ! I really enjoyed this book. I just wanted to write this out in my own words, I think it is very well written so far !|0
This movie was completely stale and uninspired . The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical characters that don't really seem like actual people, but in reality they aren't. If you didn't find anything interesting, what would be the point here? If you wanted to get this movie straightened out, you would probably want to read some more of the reviews and other reviews related to this movie. So here are some reviews of this movie. If you want more details, I suggest you go to our site and get some reviews, I highly recommend this movie.|0
Given Christopher Nolan's string of successful films, it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature, which is shot in black and white back in England, running less than 70 minutes long, done with little budget, but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller.Though short, the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing, because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale, which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative's structure and characterization.|1
"On the positive, I'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable. On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, whiny and pointless. And I'm not saying this to be mean, I really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called ""buzz"", and was a hassle to track down besides. Had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, I believe this would've been amazing."|1
While many pass this off as a B movie it is, indeed, a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fiance Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film, not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon, who directed all three of the Fox movies. This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged.|1
Probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there ` s no real hard core sex scene in the book. I agree with all of that. It's interesting to think of the story as being about some of the worst movies ever made. But I'll take the story in its own way, so it makes sense, and makes for a better look into the writing. If we don't care about the film itself, I'd be interested in that story. I've read this book, though I have no way of knowing if it actually works.|0
This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s . Guy Stone is not a good actor and the cast is not great either. He does get into trouble, though, but he's still a great actor. It's a shame though, that we don't see the film much in the news any more. What's more, I think there's just not a lot going on that I can say about the film. For me, it's only a documentary about an old movie.|0
Frederick Forsyth 's books are always so intricately plotted , with twists and turns , and usually a great surprise for me. I can’t wait for his next book , which will be released this spring . “I had the idea of buying a lot of books, and after a couple of years, I did, but it was the best idea for me! I had the right idea, and I thought that I’d get my hands on two books so I could give my readers a better reading experience.|0
"""The Journey"" is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958, in Vienna, and released in 1959, this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems, which influenced the movie's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution, the Cold War), ""The Journey"" is a very good film, but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD, because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home."|1
"It was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the ""thief"" was obvious. It was a poor man's (not to mention high school) ""Less than Zero"". I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. So many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. The voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. Avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst."|1
"I've lost count of the times I have seen this movie, but I love it and find it very funny each time I see it. The facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great. The characters, especially ""Nitro"", ""Sonar"" and ""Stepanik"" are hilarious. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a great job. In fact, I think this movie was perfectly cast. I think it does need to be released in DVD before I wear my VHS version out."|1
Hilary was great as julie , and Pat was once again magnificent as Mr. Miyagi , but there should have been some of the people who knew him well, as it was a hard job. But there were others, of course , who knew him well, as they were well aware of how he was. He was quite a nice person , but also a hard one , so it made for an awkward conversation. At the end, though , when he was at last finished with the picture , he asked Pat to send some pictures back to him, which he gave to the girl.|0
"If you thought NBC's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that FX reached into the bowels of made-for-TV hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. The filming style was the now overused ""docu-action"" look, complete with cuts to grainy B&W ""rawcore"" footage. I'm not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP said to the director before filming."|1
when this show first came to Disney, i love it started watching all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.I do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. I hat that garbage. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. The first season was very entertaining. I mostly don't like the second season because of Ben. He annoys me and pisses the crap outta me.|1
That is what this movie is . Good God the special effects suck in this movie . It is difficult to explain why that movie would have made this film , since it is just so easy to see, so easy to think. I thought it would be a better way to describe this movie, then to explain how it works, and what it does that works for. That's the point I was trying to get behind, but I didn't see the plot. I know you think this is a bad movie, but I wish I were the one who did it.|0
There are actually some good reasons , why a person should take the risk of going totally insane by watching that video, when it's all over on you. In fact, if you want to put the time to go to school, you better have some fun before you do. The main thing is that you'll have no idea what happens in the next 10 seconds. So you may have a lot to work out before you even go to sleep, but you've got to have some fun after that.|0
I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off. I never bothered to try to see Hamlet until fairly recently deciding I should at least try to watch it and I borrowed the Olivier version from the library. Well, I struggled with it. Olivier seemed far too old, not only in his looks but in his acting of the part.|1
I was looking forward to watching this film and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete and utter rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavy handed and cliched (how much more cliched can you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been chosen entirely for their resemberlance to Egon Schiele's angst ridden self portraits. Yet the themes of jealousy and betrayal which should have been the primary focus of a film of this type are left virtually unexplored. What is left is a turgid melodrama which takes an age to get started and even longer to finish.|1
"There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. Let's start with the silly and annoying songs. Like ""Ride Little Cowboy"" which just tended to accentuate the city-slickers look of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it.I had seen the media hype before this movie was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows, and he had a very soft, sweet, lilting voice."|1
I enjoyed the acting in this movie . Except for the sister . She reminded me of Janice on Friends . I'm pretty sure we can't wait to go see it . She's one of the few characters that could make us feel safe . They didn't do a good job at getting me to like the characters, but they did make an interesting story. I've never heard the name of the character in the movies, but I thought I saw something about a girl that appeared to be really cool . I loved the characters .|0
This film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry' because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon'.I was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of Portugal which I have visited. It is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black-and-white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story.A film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait. Well, a wait is a wait.|1
There were many 'spooky ' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s , and although this has a strong history, there is no denying they have always had a great tradition in the genre. In my opinion, the more popular westerns have always been the ones that had the most interest in the genre. The most famous were the ones that are seen as the most popular in the genre as they were the most distinctive of the period , and they were one of those that created the genre in that way. They were the most famous and sought after of all the Westerns to create the genre.|0
Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center , an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit cards to buy food and drink on a daily basis for thousands of guests. They have been in the neighborhood for many years now, but it took them a while to find a place they thought they could sleep in. Paul and his partner David are among the first to move into their home where they will spend the first week in January, June and November. “It makes a difference the second week in July, if you don’t like it,” Paul said.|0
"What a trip down memory lane.Do not look for great acting, believable plot lines, or anything resembling a quality movie.This is pure blaxploitation at it's finest. Outrageous outfits, unrepeatable dialog, objectification of women, and the sleaziest cops you can imagine.This vanity piece by the ""Godfather of Rap,"" Rudy Ray Moore, who left us for good last week is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured.You not only see blaxploitation at it's finest, but get glimpses of his comedy genius, and see why his records were kept under the counter."|1
A straight-forward X File that shows that action is always the equal of intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is crisp and sharp, the episode looks just as fresh now as it did almost a decade ago. David and Gillian both give fine performances and both seem to relish the lack of baggage - it's a standalone X File that even non-fans could happen upon and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both the leads a run for their money during his scene with them, he's so convincing that you could believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to.|1
"I saw this movie because every review I read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all of the hype was about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad (""What if something strange is going on?""...what????). The acting didn't blow my socks off either. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and I didn't give a hoot about them at all."|1
"After the failure of ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth,"" the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of Pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs UNDER 90 minutes... On display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched B-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while STILL attempting to keep the whole project completely serious."|1
I saw this film when it premiered in LA. I think I laughed 2 or three times. The rest of the time I was in shock at how ridiculous/poorly shot and poorly written it was. Kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film. I was disappointed at the performance of Larry Bagby , whom I usually find entertaining. If you enjoy watching your friend's crappy homemade short films that they shot on their mom's 8mm video camera then there's a slight chance you might enjoy this film. Then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that it's your buddies playing all the parts.|1
"Boring movie. Poor plot. Poor actors. The movie happens in a room supposed to be in Morocco but actually in some American city! The ""Arab terrorists"" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the ""Arab terrorist""...DAMN!There is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are Americans (or western people if you like).The movie is divided into two parts."|1
"Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I'd say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device, because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. And yet, the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. ""The Vampire's Coffin"" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director Fernando Méndez doesn't re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs."|1
"This was a great movie. It had one ""sot-so-nice"" outburst. Plus there were some very intense (drama) scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6.For a under the radar film, the acting was quite enjoyable, and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing. It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end.This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day, but was given a somewhat more believable scenario. The dream scenes were a distraction at first, but did a great deal to establish the plot."|1
I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought , despite not even having known it was available on the site before I had the opportunity to buy the DVD. I didn't buy it either, as I hadn't used it on a couple of years before so I'm pretty sure it's not on sale yet. One of the best and most informative things I have ever seen (I bought it before you guys had to) was that a friend who had the DVD came and got it on sale the other day.|0
A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She's no star yet, but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for Vanity, whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance, he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for Kelly's club, but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter.|1
For me , this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Los Angeles Lakers , I really liked it , but the whole cast just came in and I was happy with the performance , although it was terrible . The acting was bad . It’s very easy for you to be a huge star in movies , but I think it was good as well . When I was watching it , I was amazed to see the performance . It was not much better as I was surprised to see how good she was .|0
"i was one `` chosen '' to see this movie in a sneak preview.first you should know that this film is available for rental. '' is the name you chose and the time of the day to check out this movie. A few things to note about the movie:

* - This movie was released last June, but is currently not available at the theater. The release date is May 16 and the release time is February 11, 2012. It is not available in a movie store. If the movie is released, the theaters will have it."|0
Excerpt from TV GUIDE:This week on THE LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! Join the Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun-filled Halloween Special. Guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the Chupacabra.This is typical, lame Sci-Fi Channel cut-rate fare. The Captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a Carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is along for the ride, and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor.|1
The 1980 's 'My Dinner with Andre , ' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory , is essentially a dialog that is played between the two of them and it starts with their friendship. It is an exchange of ideas that you get with one or the other and it was a classic story of friendship that began with Andre. He loved his relationship with Wallace Shawn, and was able to open the door to an alliance that could work. Andre also came to be a good friend, but it was only the beginning for his friendship.|0
As I said , sometimes low budget is good . You get to see a good movie without a lot of effort. I think it is very hard to spend a couple bucks on a movie that you have no time for. You can only find one that is good and that you can have it. There is always room for improvement here. If you do something for your budget that will save you a lot of extra money, that is very useful. I think there is a small amount of literature available to support what I believe is the most popular film of the past couple decades.|0
OK , so I'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door . I open the door and I see that there is a little girl coming out of the closet. So I said to Mom , you know what? I told her to come here . She came . She didn't wait to come in . She came . She didn't wait to go. I said , that is a nice idea . But this is not the girl you were talking to when you heard the news. This is the same girl you are talking to when you heard something so horrible .|0
I had to get this movie , since it did n't come to where I live . I waited patiently to do it but I thought it might work , but I thought not. But I was a bit disappointed at what happened because it was supposed to be my dream movie but I could see that it was not a dream, but I thought it was the only thing that could do it. In the first few minutes the movie was a total success and I went to see the film again, because it was actually a movie for the next few hours .|0
I looked forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend watching a good film about Jefferson. This film was not it. It was rather long, drawn out, dull and unbalanced. Too much time was spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time was spent on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was absolutely awful. Her acting was so bad it was like watching an A1 airhead trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant whining voice grated the nerves! Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius.|1
I grew up in the 90s ; therefore , you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the day. In the mid-80s there was a guy in his teens who was doing his best for the right reasons. I was the guy in his twenties who made all the moves to get this guy out of the closet. He was a nice guy but he didn't have the heart of a person who wanted to be an artist. So he wanted to be a natural artist and if he did that in his teens or 30s then he would be pretty good.|0
Despite some really scenic locations in the orient and some sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi , this film does seem like the best in any film. As always when I make a film I look for something that I think will appeal to both of these two reasons. It has a very specific purpose that it is going to get into. I have found it interesting how many people would like it if it didn’t have the same general feel as this, and it makes for great films. But what do I think it should be?|0
"Why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation ? The whole `` Complete Jane Austin '' series as part of her book is going to sound like one''

I read The Complete Jane Austin series. I had never read it, and it wasn't great. But I do think it is pretty good, as well as much more interesting. Here's how I came up with it:

You'll see that this is what we'll call 'the complete Jane Austin series'. It's been around since the mid 60s."|0
Without John Rhys-Davies , I have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter . But in the last couple weeks I've been reading reviews about this one and this is one that might be of some use. One of the most famous scenes in The Last Supper (2014) is one that I'll get to. I'll read about it again in a few days and I'm gonna come back for more. And I hope you guys appreciate it! The first thing that popped up in the comments was that this would probably never register on my movie meter .|0

If you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall film making as me and my friends, you need to rent this.From simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is, you should assume more not funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content through out. Its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen TV to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends.|1
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies. My only quibble is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene, but the performances were so great I forgive him.Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant. The script is great, giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and, therefore, what it was like in the 30s as well). Lots of great, subtle touches, lots of broad, overplayed strokes, all of it perfectly done.|1
This is a crummy film , a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies . And a genre that's not necessarily what it's like in the real world . . . but I don't know . . . It's a comedy , and one of the most successful comedies of the twentieth century, and the one I love because I don't know anything about comedy itself , but I'm sure that you'll find this film very entertaining . . . It's probably the most fun and interesting film in the history of film , but I'm not sure how it might end .|0
I saw this movie a fews years ago and was literally swept away by it . So charming and so funny. I enjoyed it more because I am able to enjoy it more than other movies in a similar genre and that is the only reason I would have been interested in it if I could have seen it again. In fact, it was just one of those movies that you would think would fit. I did not watch it but I think it was on my mind, I didn't know why it even existed.|0
"To tell you the truth, I do not speak Tamil, and I did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, what a long name), explained every thing to me. What a great movie!!! After watching this movie, I felt I should have watched many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were amazing, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. The actress ""Simran"", what a beauty. Give her an award for best looking someone."|1
I found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, I still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans,and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during the Medieval times. Lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion.|1
Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked ! Now , her book `` Breaking Dawn '' will not be released at that moment. So, I can only say, I will not wait to see her. So, I will start with a very short review of it. First, the book will be written by my mother. She will start the book by reading her mother`s diary. Then she will write a brief description of the story. I will finish the first section and then she will outline what it was about and how it happened.|0
"I 'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie . Do n't get me wrong , it's one of the most awesome films I have ever seen . All these reviews should have helped you out . I really hope it helps you . Thanks everyone for watching the movie . It is a wonderful experience to see what is going to come out and how I can't help myself . Review Summary:

A lot of the reviewers mentioned this movie as having the strongest reviews yet, but there are certainly other reviews that I'm sure many people would love to read."|0
For connoisseurs of bad movies , Galaxina is a true gem . With truly horrid dialog , acting , and cinematography all you need to know about her. Galaxina makes you believe that she is beautiful . And why do you choose to believe that she is ugly . She is also the perfect actress to make you believe . She has her fair share of acting and directing skills . But is this true for Galaxina? And to what extent does she have a true love of her own . She has a strong personality . And why should we assume that she is ugly ?|0
"I thought this was a great action flick . A very good role for Geena Davis . She is a very good actress, but if she gets to go to the big screen she'll go to it very badly . Her performances in ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Walking,"" ""Cinemax,"" ""Cinema,"" and ""Drown in the River"" all show the power of her talents . She could do an action film if you like her acting. But she's an actress who's always been on the cutting edge of the theater."|0
I attended a screening of this movie . It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups, but it wasn't bad. It had a good acting department, nice storyline, a good supporting cast and even some funny performances, but it did a little bit of mischief. It didn't have all the laughs but it got some laughs that I couldn't resist. It is still not as good as he had hoped for in his previous role. I don't think that the movie will ever get a lot of laughs.|0
I don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. It Was Great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a Bruce movie for you watch it for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining I still crack up when I recall Bruce on that pink moped. Now I will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear.|1
Naach would have won an Razzie for the Worst Film in 2004 ( may be overall too ) if it were released in 2005. It would have fallen apart in a similar way to The Matrix, although with a little luck. He had made a lot of money at the time but that didn't seem to be the case, at least not really for the short-lived. In fact it's pretty hard to remember a movie like that, and it's still hard to believe they'd make a movie of it.|0
A rather mild horror movie ; if not for a couple of sex scenes , it could easily have been more sex-crazed and sex-crazed. And if you read my last posts, you could see what the main story behind the sex-crazed sex scenes was. This movie is one of those films that you really can’t get out of, yet it is the only thing you can see in this movie, I have been reading it a few times now. It’s a bit weird to watch the whole movie, like you can’t tell where to start thinking about sex scenes.|0
I wo n't be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season , but then , things changed when you watched the first season , which in turn resulted in an episode that was better in my opinion than the previous one. I hope that we can make it better too. I have watched the first season so many times and still do not want to see it when I see it so I would like you to know whether you enjoyed it or not. I still feel like the first season was not as good, but I would love to see more of the series.|0
One of the more prominent/popular episodes , but clearly one of the worst . A red-shirt female falls for Khan-Khan. The episode ends with Khan falling on his face and saying to his wife that she should never have married Khan. This episode only lasted about 10-15 minutes, so it should not have taken much more than 1.4 hours to get back the episode and make it better. Another one of the lesser-known episodes of a Pakistani TV series is Akshay Khan, which was one of the most talked about episodes in Pakistan in recent years .|0
I normally don't like romantic films, but I love this film very much. The story is really touching, and the ending is very appropriate. I feel I really care for many characters in this film. I feel I can feel their feelings. While most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this one completely makes me feel involved, starting from the scene of Capshaw running along the beach with Scott until the ending scene. I want to rate this film 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra one point for the ending.|1
Well, I have been to a British University, in fact I went to the one in this very film, and it was nothing like that. This is a horrible, badly made and acted film. Worst thing is, it could have been really good, if they bothered to spend more that 12p on it, in fact if it really wanted to represent true British Students it should off acted like one and took out a 15 thousand pound loan. It says nothing about Uni life, where was the bush diving, the tea drinking till 4am, the endless chats about group dynamics???|1
So I was sick with the flu one Saturday and the silver lining was that SciFi Channel was having a lot of good times and Sci-Fi News was having some excellent ones. If that was true, then Sci-Fi News might have some good shows and movies. I got tired of Sci-Fi and I knew that there were a lot of things I didn't care about, like the fact that I didn't see the movie that was being made for the film and I didn't know what that was or what was going on with my life.|0
Leslie Nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that I have ever seen. There is nothing to like about this film, as it is essentially a one-joke film, and the joke isn't all that funny. How many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself? That's not funny, that's just pitiful. Nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong needs to stick to making Jackie Chan films, because it doesn't get much worse than this.|1
For several reasons , this movie is simply awful . Other posters have listed some of this movie 's historical moments . There are some of these films and they don't do much good . I would say the only thing that is good in any case is that there is no good film . I think this film is perfect . It is very well made and it will get you to the next level. You are in no way disappointed . If you have the patience . You will love this film because there is nothing like it when it comes to acting .|0
Another sequel ! Why on earth do they keep making these ? This has got to be the weakest 'franchise' they've ever built ! I thought I'd find out what they are ! I wonder why we don't keep making this ! I'm sure we won't ! I hope you don't decide to go the extra mile ! But I don't think you can afford to spend a ton ! As a matter of fact, when I asked the guy on the street if he had any money in his pocket, he said, 'I don't need anything else' ...|0
I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes I just couldn't stop laughing at! Dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes, and just says the stoopidest things...but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) The beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes Robbie Coltrane...! Not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you haven't got much else to do (like I did).|1
"This movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers.He also loves his mommy. So, to keep the money coming in, he takes his act to Broadway.SEE! CODY POWERS JARRETT BLOW HIMSELF UP ON HIS BIGGEST GAS CONTAINER YET! TONIGHT! 7.30PM! However, one day, his mommy dies and Jarrett goes berserk. He kidnaps the audience in the theatre and makes them all stand on top of a huge gas cylinder.Losing control further, he makes them all scream ""MADE IT MA, TOP OF THE CYLINDER!"""|1
I like dark humor and non-PC stuff, but not if it is with no purpose but to elevate yourself. Bashing a group of people without any trace of self-irony is crap.There are people who could make concentration camp jokes funny, but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the VERY easy task of making fun about Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if your are the Germany equivalent of an inbred redneck (=inbred Southerner from a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals) you certainly will fail at this and also at life.|1
I have watched two episodes so far, I really like it. Even though I am no longer in college, it makes me miss the wonderful college life. I wish that I spent a little more time socializing. I kind of identify myself with rusty. When I was rushing a fraternity, my big brother was not like Cappie at all, I wish that I had a big brother like him. So if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters, then it is a pretty good show.It is more realistic than American pie with less explicit sex jokes.|1
Where do we start with an offering like this ? I nearly said film but that would be going a bit far if there wasn’t a whole lot of space. You know what I mean. The only way I can tell you this is I know what I want you to do and I want you to try and get it done and then if I can get it done, you can start doing it. You’ve been doing this since the first time I saw you at the party. You’ve been doing this for a very long time.|0
Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. Ranch hand & ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognises Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient Latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it.|1
This is precious. Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue. Oh, how I've been waiting for this to arrive in Austin. While Elijah Wood is charming as ever as Jonathan Safran Foer (the real-life author of the novel Everything Is Illuminated), it's Eugene Hutz (playing Jonathan's Ukrainian tour-guide and translator, Alex) who truly steals this film. Alex is a hip-hop-lovin' Ukrainian break-dancer who, along with his grandfather, helps Jonathan find the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II.|1
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama 's brought upon us by Hollywood , this movie excels where we are at. This is one of the first 's that made its first appearance in this film, so we thought it was very good. I was a little surprised at this, since this movie is about a woman’s journey. While it’s interesting how many women who have ever made movies have made movies, it is the story of how it’s been and how they came to be.|0
I know my summary sounds very harsh , but this film has very limited appeal . The average Joe out of the country is only 7 to 10 years away , which is a little over half what it would be for a normal American man . . . it's not even as bad as I'd imagine . . . But I can see why there's not many of these stories . . In a country where almost all Americans have been killed over a long period of time, there has been more than a tiny fraction of the deaths of a lot of people than there were when the Civil War began .|0
"This film, also known as ""don't look in the basement"" is actually not bad. It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but I found this movie pretty entertaining. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me. I thought the acting , which seemed forced at first, somehow got better as the film went along. It seems like the actors really got into their roles."|1
A friend brought me this movie and at first I was hesitating , the pace in the movie was so fast (about a minute , I had to pause to watch) but then I decided I needed to play with a few of the characters. I went on to have some laughs and was enjoying the action. The story is not very well developed, and the dialogue is very dry. The only problem is you don't make sense of the action of the movie itself. That's not good. I'd say there is a lot of action in the movie.|0
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood when it really didn't. After a few more years I finally made peace with the fact that even I couldn't sleep. That was just the thing. I think I've always been a great writer and that my writing has definitely been the greatest in the history. I haven't forgotten the times I've spent on the road. I don't feel like writing since I have no idea what my life would be like if you didn't feel like you could.|0
This film is truly a sorry excuse for film making. The pacing is poor, the budget must have been depressingly low, and the acting is cut-rate (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The audio at this point in time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie. If these things bother you at all, don't watch this film.If you can get past this, however, you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one.|1
"Why bother, ITV? Admittedly, Mansfield Park is the most difficult of the novels to ""get,"" and Fanny is certainly the hardest to like, but... If one is going to take it on, then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit. And for heaven's sake, have the guts to cast Fanny as she was written: A prissy, good-hearted, sweetish, whiner! Mrs. Norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been. And what the heck happened to Portsmouth?"|1
"This is a low budget , well acted little gem . Alice , a small town Massachusetts teenager , fed and entertained her friends from kindergarten up until school day . This was certainly a great gift for us all . And it was one of our most personal and memorable gifts to have on hand , and it was one of ours as well . I am so glad we did this . And not just a handful of other little things we did , but this one is very special !!! :D

I wanted to thank you so much for the gift I received this week by giving it to our little girl ."|0
Like the previous two 'Mad Max ' films , 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ' is not exception to the violence, but more than one of the characters in the films was killed or injured while in an elevator. Also, in both of those films, there are scenes in which the female lead does not get to be the main victim of the elevator, but rather that the male lead comes into the elevator in the film's final seconds. In both of those movies, the male lead does not actually kill or injure, but simply dies in the elevator after it's finished, making the story all about that.|0
We found this movie nearly impossible to watch . With such a super cast , it 's a shame that I can't get a decent look at it . I would be more interested to see what the movie will look like , if it 's worth watching . The problem with that is that even when watching movies on a big screen . . . . or at night . . . The problem with that is that . . . you 're going to see all of the crap . . . and not get an idea what it is . . .|0
The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia 's `` Nine Lives '' comes when Sissy Spacek , hidden away in a tiny room in an apartment complex in the Caribbean islands of Haiti, sets off on their journey home. As the four-year-old sets sail, she sees the world from a different vantage point. Her father has called on her to save his children, but only to keep his word. When she arrives in San Juan, her mother calls her sister, who has run into her room, to make sure she has the time of her life on her hands.|0
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and mercenaries from the underworld who have taken over the city and have become the world’s biggest slums. As you can see in the below image, it’s quite possible that some of those mercenaries have been able to take over this city as the world’s most powerful slum over the past few centuries. However, in this case, it’s possible that the mercenaries have taken over the city and the slums have become the slums of the world.|0
What I got was something better.Just like many movies I 've commented on as of recently , I 'd been looking for a good movie to try out. It took me about 3-4 months to download the whole thing , I hope you guys can help me out here. I need a few ideas to make it easier . . .I will post more of my pics on how I got it here . . . .It took me about 5 months to find it and it is great . . . .If you are looking for some pictures you can find it on the web . .|0
"One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore, ""Ten Cents a Dance"" stars Barbara Stanwyck as the dance-hall girl ""Barbara"" in her sixth role. Stanwyck looks quite ""plain-jane"" in this one, and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager. Then along comes rich guy Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to sweep her off her feet. (Cortez and Stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s.) Then she meets Eddie, who's very different from the dashing Carlton."|1
This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.It's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). I won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience, but rest assured: it's very believable, well played, very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.Don't miss this movie.|1
I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.We were both nervous and I was so nervous.I’m so scared.It’s like we’ve lost control of our emotions.I don’t know if it’s true or not.But I don’t want that to happen to me. So I think I’ve just started to get into that panic, you know what I mean? What am I going to tell you? It’s like we’ve lost our power of imagination and we’re not sure how to go about doing it, you know?|0
This movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! i waste my time on this. I watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it doesn't have any continutity. It feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing software!!! Music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role does Celina Jaietly has in the movie? Bobby deol is good.|1
You know the old saw about a train wreck ? The one about how you ca n't look away ? I have a great many ideas. One of them is this quote : I have no desire for to give up on my life as an artist. I believe that art is what people want. If you are serious, you can take your art seriously! I'm looking for a friend who can show me an art lesson from an art school class. She could give it to me at some point. The teacher is a very nice fellow who is a very knowledgeable and interesting person.|0
I am an Australian currently living in Japan . I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by how well written and action packed the series was. I was so impressed and I hope I’ll see many more on this series. I think this was a very well done film which was very enjoyable. I will not be buying another one as i was not a fan of that movie until this time. Thanks so much. As always, thanks for reading and you have made a great decision on how you will feel about all this.|0
"Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. All is in the cliché of the ""mentor"" and the ""talented immature pupil"". The characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate."|1
This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone is intended to be a Rock Hudson type, but both the script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton instead, which makes for an unpleasant character.Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours.Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone's celibate lesbian manager.|1
Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'Attack of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. So, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix movies like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and flavor it with some parody like Scary Movie.|1
Well , some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin. And if they're not convinced by the fact that there isn't actually a black vampire in the scene , why is she supposed to kill someone? It's not like he's been around the area for some time or another, but he sure looks pretty harmless when he goes out there with his friends. And if he is, what do you think is going to happen when they go to see this? Should we shoot it with a laser pointer?|0
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster ( though it might be interesting to note that the film has an English-language sub-genre) is the “Familial Screens” video which was released in June 2013, followed by an English-language trailer in 2015. This is the story of four couples, who are married in the Italian-speaking village of Gavazzi in northern Sardinia, where they are working to find a home for their missing child. The family’s case is atypical in that it’s set up with the husband and the child’s natural father, who has been working at a private brothel.|0
I saw this movie with my mother , and I loved it ! It was such a sweet story , it made me want to have it back. The first few scenes had the same look but we were able to get away with it without breaking the heart. Now I'm not sure why but in the end it was just good . Thank you very much for watching , you made my life a lot easier : ) Hope it helps someone. So I got all the clothes from my mom . I don't remember who I bought them from but they were from my dad and mom .|0
I have to say this is one of the best movie i have seen so far for naruto . the story is dark and the music is great. ive been looking for it since i saw the movie in the movie library but its hard to find that. any help will be appreciated. I was looking for this to be one of the reviews that I have seen. It was a huge hit as i saw the score. It was also my second movie in this series. It is my first review that i've ever put on.|0

I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didn't feel like watching tripe like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy who keeps to himself. He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it. His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is in running. He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes.|1
Contains Major Spoilers, on the off chance you would actually care about the story line.OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobbers the power grid.Predictable schlock from the start, and if that weren't enough, the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been. For example: will they make it to the airport in time? Things look dim as we go to a commercialand the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane!|1
This film is one of the best of 1986 with creepy, yet intriguing performances from Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for a lot of people, not just teenagers, but this flick really captured the desperation and despair. Well-directed with great script (apparently based on a true story), I don't really see any weaknesses in this. The opening shot was brilliant.Keanu Reeves was decent for a change and Miss Skye was right on the money. Hopper had three other great performances that same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II, and Hoosiers).|1
This movie will not be considered for an academy award , but if you enjoy a movie that does n't make much sense to you. It is the only one to have been done by a professional actor. I will not judge it for its value but it does n't have the potential to be the greatest movie ever made by anyone. I am going to do a quick review on the character of the movie and how he's portrayed. The movie itself is very simple, very short, very detailed, almost a story.|0
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about their lives in New York City. Their lives have been together for years now, and they have been trying to become better at making music together but their life is different. Susan Sarandon has made the record of her love for music, even though her parents are both musicians. I had never seen her on stage before and I was pretty surprised to find myself thinking of her in the way I had thought about her a few hours before.|0
"Also titled--> The Magical Castle--> This one is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake. Only some girlfriend of rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (not voices remain). Stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread. Next thing you know some bird will have memorized the ""forbidden arts"" and Swan Princess 4: the magical bird will be born."|1
I have seen this movie three times. Going back to VCR's, in the 1980's, and again on The Encor channel last night (Feb.11, 2010). Based on a true story which I remember being in the news, during the early 1980's, I've decided that I find it too disturbing to watch ever again. Yet it's hard to look away from a car accident. The creepiest character is Joshua John Miller, who plays Keeanu Reeves little brother. (The story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the Internet -- just Google it.|1
"I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when it came on A&E some years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave it a chance because I liked these actresses. This has got to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video. The storyline of this TV version is ludicrous and just plain stupid! The ""kicker"" (pun intended) comes when Ruth has surgery done on her leg bones."|1
Neal N Nikki is voted on of the Worst films of the year by Planetbollywood . Its hard to believe we are all so bad but what can we do? . . . “We know it’s bad, but it’s not good. It’s not just that our movies aren’t great and terrible but that our movies are a little bit too good (for us), because of the way they do things, which is an important part of cinema. That’s part of why we like movies. We like movies because we enjoy doing things.|0
I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me , and we both had the same goal. There was no way. I had done my best , but I just kept running to get there. Now that I've been able to see this movie, I've finally figured out why it was the way I wanted it. Now that I finally know why it has to be so important to do it the way I want it, I think I can come up with some really useful information and some reasons to change my way of doing something new.|0
"The Giant Claw is in fierce competition with films like , 'Robot Monster ' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. In the last episode of the series, 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' the Giant Claw is back on its own. In the episode, ""Escape from Outer Space,"" the Giant Claw appears to the left of the show as a small robot carrying a weapon in a fight with the humans. In the same episode ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" we see the Giant Claw being picked up by a robot in a fight, causing a lot of damage and causing damage to the humans."|0

so if a guy meets you and he says 'I want you to look at my erection!' don't be alarmed, maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built. yes! that's the only thing what happens in this movie! it's like the worst Warholian BEEP I ever saw! it's like filming the inside of your toilet before you flush it, in fact, it's less interesting to look at than that.but if you do watch Lennon's Erection, be warned that he put a lot of background noise in it too.|1
"I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12"" x 10"". So I really wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle, so I thought I'd watch just a few minutes. Next thing I know I'm sucked in, having a great time, and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment."|1
Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear. The appeal of Mr. Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from the sky or another planet. He is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily. He is often alone and used to it. He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times. There are other characters who speak to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is.|1
You may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, I looked for the director's name. When I saw it, I burned it into my memory and I never forgot it. This movie is beyond terrible. It makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, this was a soul deadening experience. The quality was so bad, I began to wonder who allowed this to happen.I hear Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork.|1
Im warning you people out there , this is just a waste of your time . I am being honest , I think you can get away with a few things but I think if you have a serious attitude , I think you'll find the point of your problem is your attitude. I know you have a tough life , I am not afraid to say that but if you do that , then the whole world can take care of itself and I think it's a very wise decision , I'm sure it will take you a while to get back to normal.|0
This has to be the worst movie i 've seen this year .. and i watch a lot of cable, i 'm thinking i could make it a little more interesting. I have no idea, I can't imagine what i would've expected to see this time of year as well. Maybe it'll come to an end this fall. And for now, I know you'll be watching for a little while, and it will be all right. It will not be this late in the day and I'll be out of town.|0
As a non-theist Im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago. Safe to say, science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then.The film was produced by the BBC, and to be honest, it could quite easily have been shown on television. While the acting is superb, the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release. That said, if it reaches a wider audience this way, then so be it.|1
This movie was a major bait and switch . I rented it because of Rebecca St. James , a popular character and the story of two girls . We were trying to hook up a few girls, but it's not going very well because I'm trying to get them to stay together. It's more about the relationship than the story . I would love to have a few of the girls that we can hook up together . They're all the way up and down in the town. I'm hoping that the girls get to see what we are up to .|0
hello, looking for a movie for the family to watch on a Friday night? Can't find what your looking for? I thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike. It was brilliant, to say the least. Bruce Willis's acting was top-notch, there was a lot of humor in it and overall, a great movie. In my opinion, it's a must-see movie.|1
This is most likely the best picture not many will see. It presented a culture in a real unhollywoodized way. A must see for all who like Indie and for those who don't. I think this movie will draw more into the Indie scene. The acting was top notch! The character of Alice was portreyed so well. With perfect akwardness. This movie ahould be brought to the mainstream! I think it would do phenominally! ALICE is the most real look at an element of our culture that I have seen since GO ASK ALICE. A look that is untouched by the Hollywood hand.|1
"WARNING : PLOT SPOILERThe always-abnormal movies of David Cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste . Fans of his earlier films will not like the idea of him turning into an actor, but the first one has been made by the actor himself. He’s the best actor in history. This is not a joke, because Cronenberg is no actor at all. In the film he’s almost the only character from the movie who is a man. ‘What’s in a name?’

“I will say I have no names, because I can’t give you names."|0
All the reviewers are making one big mistake. This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made for kids and teens of the late 80ies or early 90ies and as such it was truly a film of it's time. If you hated that period, or love the first movie so much that you can't even take a joke about it, then this is garbage, but only because it wasn't meant for you. The low budget here and failure of the Beastmaster 1 at the box office (grossed under four mil. with a nine mil.|1
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite , which I try to catch on TV every year if I can , but it never gets old in my brain. A Christmas tree is a tiny, green toy that you can make out of wood when you go to the tree house every Christmas. The best part, though, is that the old tree is much too small for my little baby. It looks so tiny, but it is a wonderful tree to get up to, and when it is about five feet tall, it can be held down in my hand for just a little.|0
They used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make them feel better about society. So when I went to the police I didn’t know how to handle it: I had just seen footage of some real protest going on. And I was not in the police department. And I was not at the station. I was not on my way to the station. I couldn’t explain how I felt. I had never been to the police station before. I had never been to any police station.|0
This film is bad . Not so bad it is good . Just bad . It is however hilariously bad . The worst part of the film was that it made me laugh. When I came home from vacation to my new house, my friends were telling me that something had to be done. I thought about it and decided to keep on thinking about it. I was really sorry that it was so funny. The rest of the film I was so sorry about it. The only thing that made me really sad was the fact that I did not remember the movie as a whole.|0
"This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.The fights are not of high standards. They are way too ""simple"" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success."|1
I watched all three mad max films in succession for the first time a few days ago and was left scratching my head. Now I’ll post a picture of them so you don’t have to look at them for the rest of your day if you don’t mind. The first Mad Max films were in the 80s, and while it was cool (I’ll admit I wasn’t exactly in awe), it’s still weird to me. The cinematography was awful. It was pretty awful.|0
I was n't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face . Julie Walters , I know that could be you , but this movie is supposed to be one of the most famous. I do hope that they have some really great films to show off for fans to see, but it's hard not to feel like it's been a success for you in the long run . I hope that you are as excited for your next movie as I was . I just hope that you enjoyed it . If this is your dream, then I will make a movie with you .|0
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well . Compared to Kurosawa's style and the style of the series , his style is somewhat dated in the sense of the style of Japanese cinema . But in a way, his style does not resemble Kurosawa so much that if it was a real style, it would have had a lot more meaning and impact. For example, there is some confusion over whether the style of the manga was the manga, a cartoon, or simply a different type of style.|0
This junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a pickle slice does to a cucumber. The film makers took the Alamo section out of the book, made it into a movie, and said it was based on the book. Hah! Wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to endorse this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, 13 days of glory collection of poppycock. I almost started rooting for the mexicans, just to get the damn thing to end.|1
For all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, Pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. That's what remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living.|1
"Jim Brown stars and produces a tale set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion . The story has been edited and published by The A-Z News, under the license of The Associated Press. ""I thought it was going to be a very interesting piece. It's a pretty funny story about the Philippines."" The Philippine news agency reported Tuesday that in the wake of an attack in Manila, the government was ready to act to quell the attacks, but the government still didn't come up with a plan for an attack."|0
Chick Flick ? Of course .... Been done before ? Many times .... Predictable ? Yes ..... Worth watching ? But I'm pretty sure of it. So I think it's fine, if I can't do a second watch now? I don't believe I can watch for more than 6 months. Just because I can ... I've been working on a small project for 15 years now - I'm really starting to see the light of day when I'm working on the project. It's been very hard, I've only just started to understand how I can do it.|0
I do n't care what anyone else says , this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film history. It will destroy any chance of people being able to appreciate the film because it did nothing to harm their lives or make them happy, or make them look sad at their worst moment. The movie is not to be believed. The movie was not designed to protect the innocent and the innocent. There is no doubt about it being the most awful movie ever filmed. The movie was intended for a certain audience and the movie was not designed for anyone who was not a movie buff.|0
"Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler ( A real acting stretch ... ) named Rip , who is forced to take the spot as a ""fantasy"" wrestler, in an exclusive fight at the Battle Royal on March 6, 2012. Hogan (B-I) won his first fight at the Battle Royal, losing his first fight in four years, in his first fight, in the Battle Royal in 2011 and his second in 2012. Hogan was the champion at the 2011 Royal Battle. He won his third and fourth fight at the Battle Royal at the 2012 Battle Royal."|0
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career .... As I had seen all the movies (and still have) he has to play the role of Ghilli and the story of his life has to take on the whole of cinema. But Ghilli is a hero and an amazing actor. He plays the lead in the movie and as such, he is a perfect role for the role. He is one of the most exciting actors to have played in this genre of the movies. He has also written a lot of great novels.|0
"What an utter disappointment. Forget this abysmal film and get hold of the TV series instead. What on earth were they doing making the American president relatively sane? ALL the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (Peter Cook is good as the British PM). It lacks the biting satire of the original, going instead for ""lowest common denominator"" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if I'm being generous! This is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people."|1
After seeing the Harry Potter movies , I 've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint , Daniel Radcliffe and Al Pacino. I really liked both movies and thought their performances were a little off, but when it came to the actors I really enjoyed the performances . I would say they are pretty well done, but when I watched it I wasn't surprised I enjoyed it. I think Daniel Radcliffe was so good , he actually had a lot more of a 'real' role . Daniel radcliffe was always so very good , he just had a great character .|0
The Man with the Golden Arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic ( and the first to have an emotional impact on a character) the role of Jack in the World of Iceberg (1928-1932). In this book Jack appears to be the first person to play a part in the development of iceberg (and, I have a very close relationship to Jack, the last in the series, so that’s a pretty broad picture). For the purposes of this presentation I will use the character from the earlier book, as it was written and is a little dated.|0
"I have for years remembered a song `` JUST A COUPLE IN A CASTLE '' ( `` No . twenty four. ''), a song written by Bob Dylan and later by Bob Dylan Jr. in 1968 and performed by the Beatles. He wrote '' ""

In the mid 1950's and the '60's the song was a hit, with more and more radio stations giving its radio coverage to more and more radio stations. In the mid '60's, the song was played on the television, on the BBC radio, and in the radio playbill."|0
As an ex ( nuclear ) submarine officer I must admit this is my favorite submarine movie ( even exceeding my expectations ) and it was the most enjoyable submarine movie to watch last night and I am happy to be a submarine officer . It is also a great way to start learning new things that could be useful for my career . Also it is definitely something I want to watch again and also to try out other submarine movies. So if you are looking for any submarine movies, this is the movie you can see for free .|0
This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle, to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same you'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn, as is the photography, sets, lighting, and video it was shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite.|1
I occasionally let my kids watch this garbage so they will understand just how pathetic the show 's `` contestants are. But I guess that's not what they are after. And that is why I've spent so much time playing the show over and over again until now. I'm so tired of it all. I was thinking I'd go back to college and spend a lot of time with my kids, too. But I'm not a big fan of shows I haven't watched in years or years, either.|0
This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It's the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Thank God it was never made. Too much danger of marring the original. 'The Long Kiss' checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment. This has to be Jackson's funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career.|1
"One of the worst theatrical movies of the year , if not all time . Anthony Hopkins belittles himself by saying it was ""a comedy"" in which there was no action , he says he is ""still very fond of comedy""

""There were moments when he said 'the world was going crazy' in a very different way"" . He has said this in many different interviews over the years. In fact, Hopkins says he is still very fond of comedy , and has said many times he had a ""dissapoint moment with comedy"". That moment may be what he meant."|0
the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... EVER.the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).and the dancing...|1
"""First Snow"" has an intriguing beginning. A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man, who's predictions turn out to be amazingly correct. From this point on the movie plays out like a bloated ""Twilight Zone"" episode. I mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, disregarding other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia. The ending is especially weak, with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience."|1
THE AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood as hesitant lovers. She has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer. He's an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her. Their affair, such as it is, is doomed from the start, and she knows it, but goes along with it anyway. Two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this: Wood's Jane Fonda hairdo that is never mussed, no matter what, and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick.|1
The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty row studio, this one is one stinkeroo.Unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime perpetrator. Earl Dwire plays a halfbreed white and Indian who for reasons that are not explained, pretends he's a Mexican, hokey accent and all. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of advertising fame back in the day.He and his gang happen upon Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really don't have anything worth robbing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and have his way with her.|1
When a group of escaped convicts manage to flee to a remote island , they soon find that their new leader is hiding behind bars , or else he is behind bars as he is trying to hide himself from police. There is no one in the area to take the prisoners away to escape police . As the group try to free themselves by fleeing from a group that had managed to make a good run for it , it is found that the leader of the group has no way of knowing that they did not have the time to do so .|0
Frederick Forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. This adaptation had none of that.So much of what was great in the book (the history of Monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. Instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.Forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission.|1
"Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the `` earlies '' ( often black and white and inventive ) and the `` earline '' ( sometimes white)

As you will see there are several different options for choosing the right earline to use ( see the next chapter). However, we will cover only one earline choice in the following section

# Choosing earline options

As you may have guessed, it's hard to tell from the description in this guide if the earline is the one chosen. Most of the earline choices are obvious to the average user."|0
"I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious ; It 's not like American Pie or something . I like to talk about this on Facebook , it is funny to some people but I can't remember if I had any sense of humor in it. I was talking with some guy who had done a story of a woman who had a crush on him that he'd never met, the story was called : ""If it weren't for me, you'd never get me!"" This is probably because I think it is a bit ridiculous, it is not true."|0
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason. Definitely not a well made movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity, this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie.|1
This is on my TV right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment. The previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much I hope and pray. I will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better! I can't believe this screenwriter is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million-fold! I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced.|1
This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to take a little bit more time than usual, so they get called off. This is the reason why it’s important to get a better idea of what a misfit is supposed to do, so we try to do it as quickly as possible so that we are able to make the right decision. A misfit, as I mentioned in the video, does have a number of important characteristics. First of all, a misfit can have many different levels of difficulty or difficulty.|0
OK, this movie, was the worst display I have seen in years. The actors weren't to bad (I figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). Anyways, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL a UFO Sci-Fi movie. WRONG. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message onto people. The last scene was extremely messed up. That is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. What someone believe in is a matter of opinion.|1
A recent re-issue of the French crime film ( original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes ' ) , with the help of two filmmakers, makes for a much better picture. It's hard not to be reminded that we're talking about a French crime film. We'd been doing it before, but it has taken decades and hundreds of hours for us to reach a point where we're making it. We are doing it because our films have made us feel more at ease with what a film is. In a way, this was a real breakthrough, especially for those of us who had made it before.|0
"This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. It's done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves (""You loved her?""). Danny, Big Stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. There's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner."|1
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one . Paul Giamatti lets it all out on this one . And I have no idea who it was. I don't see what it is that has happened to him. I guess he's just trying to figure it out for himself. I'll go look for the name of the website. I've been trying to figure out if I've got the right person or not. But I haven't had any luck finding someone who might have found the person. Any advice?|0
**Spoiler* It gives away the very irrelevant ending**At the beginning of this movie, there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. Blood Feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 galloner. But, then he goes and claims that Dr. Gore was a 15 galloner.|1
Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at Good Burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger stand, while his buddy Dexter (Kennan Thompson) also works there, but lack Ed's single-minded devotion to his job he's there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher Mr. Wheat (Sinbad) and has to raise money to pay the damages. When Mondo Burger, a mammoth fast-foot chain, opens across the street, it looks like Good Burger is history, until Ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door.|1
"Without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. This movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. On top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from ""evidence"" to ""violence,"" I had the entire plot figured out. There are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste any money."|1
"I don't care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! It combines the bleak seriousness of Threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the Western and Eastern blocs at the time. You gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of ""Duck and cover"" or ""Protect and survive""!Imagine someone made a movie based on the Dead Kennedys track 'Kinky Sex Makes The World Go Round', and you're pretty close to Whoops!"|1
Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot.|1
This is only the fourth effort I’ve watched from this director (whom I met and found quite genial at the 2004 Venice Film Festival Italian B-movie retrospective) and also, possibly, the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example from the tail end of the Euro-Cult era – prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time! Here, in fact, we get a plot revolving around – I’m not kidding, folks – a killer phone!|1
If you love Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic, and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style, and I loved every second of it, from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story, which blends Shakespearean tragedy, murderous love, Gothic horror, and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy.|1
"OK, when I say ""wow,"" I mean, ""Jesus, please help me."" I have an old VHS copy that was printed before Troma got a copy of the title. The movie is about an alien crash landing on Earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion. WATCH OUT!!! And by that, I mean watch out for those special effects. There is an amazing number of mistakes. The acting is terrible, but I'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the Sheriff."|1
`` Son of the Mask '' is a terrible excuse of a movie . I went to see this with some friends at the local theater. They were looking for something to wear on their arm, and we were told to get dressed, so we went into the dressing room. We were greeted by a white guy in an army-style military outfit, wearing a mask and a bow, and wearing a shirt and a dress. I was in the front row, and we got out of my seat and looked around the theater to see what the crowd was wearing.|0
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie . The movie is a disaster movie about a disaster that happened in the real world . It is the only way of finding out who is behind it . This is the story of an ordinary American and a group of three people from the United States who have a lot of personal problems. They have a lot of love, trust and a lot of responsibility . It is the same movie that you have been hearing about a long time in the movie theater , and you can see that there is a lot of blame.|0
The movie had no excitement and does not have anything to hold your interest. The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!! How can a movie be romantic if the girl never gets a the right guy until the last seen in the movie, than the movie ends??? Maybe part II will be romantic, but somebody else will have to risk wasting their money! I have nothing else to say other than do not waste your time!!! The movie had nothing exiting,funny,dramatic or romantic about it!!!|1
"Fox is pretty lame . They cancel the wrong shows . It 's bizarre that they would cancel a well-written film with a great ending . I think this is more of a ""do this one"" thing than they would like to admit . It's a good, funny thing for the show . I have a feeling that this is going to work . I want the show to be well done . I agree that this isn't good . It is a great ending . But it's not the ending that they're going to want to do ."|0
This film did not excite me. While on vacation in Turkey I noticed that it was playing at the local cinema and decided to take the chance to go see it. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags during the middle of the film.One thing that I did not quite follow is how Borte was able to get the money to bribe the guards.The other thing that I did not particularly like was the missing segment of Khan's life. It did not go into detail as to how the bad guys were able to find him and re-imprison him after he had gone missing for so long.|1
Sadly this film lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. And not only that, goes well under the mark. Far Cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film.|1
"I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s -- films so ridiculous and silly that the world would just as easily forget it. It’s just a film, so to speak, that should be considered a film at its worst and not at its top for any reason. So to say the least, this is just a movie: It may not have any good qualities at all -- even though there are probably a lot of reasons for that. A couple of things:

1) One of the things I liked was the way this stuff ended."|0
"I loved the first movie , the second one was okay , disappointed John Cleese was n't jean bob anymore, but it was good , I think that was better , but it was still pretty good , so thanks for all of the comments

I'm going to have to admit that I really didn't like John Cleese's first movie but I do like the first two, but he is pretty good, the only reason to go back is because there is always a scene in it that's not there. It makes me think there is a scene in it, but that's about it anyway."|0
"Yes, I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! Julie Andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the ""Whistling in the Dark"" production number. The sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.I only wish that this film could be found in video or DVD as I would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!"|1

Oh yeah , this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of `` worst 80 's. But if you take that award for a second - and you win it by a second - he'll probably do just fine.'' And there's still a possibility that the award can't be considered a legitimate award given the way it has been in recent decades. At the time, it was the same award as the previous year's 50/50/50 division, but the winner was the top pick in the second round.|0
I love Umberto Lenzi's cop movies -- ROME ARMED TO THE TEETH is my favorite -- and his DESERT COMMANDOS pretty much legitimized the Italian Euro War phenomenon by managing to actually be a pretty good movie. Give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking tough and it's hard for him to miss.What a shame it is then to encounter his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could have been by anybody, really, and one watches them with a sense that he was under contract, was told what kind of films to make, was assigned a cast & crew and given a budget, deadline and script.|1
A group of four young men, attending a prestigious private school, belong to an old covenant that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunts of the late 1600s. They each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have perished long ago. This new guy wants everyone's power for himself.This not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all that supernatural stuff, but this is really just an action movie.|1
Like the other comments says , this might be surprise to those who have n't seen the work of Jeunet, I have always thought of his work as something unique, i would say that it may have been the first thing of the post, or perhaps it was the last. I am in a hurry to finish this, will post more if the time allows, because I will have to go back a day or so. If you can, please take a look at it. I would be interested to know the link of your article to this, although I have read your blog.|0
While my kids enjoyed the movie ( and announced afterward that they want to buy it later ) I think they should be able to enjoy this movie even if it didn’t work. Now if they could just take it apart so they could enjoy the movie , I’d love to know why I’d want to take it apart anyway, but it seems to me that you shouldn’t do this in the future . So, if you have a great movie , I’d love to know what to do . You can do it with any kind of plan or whatever you want .|0
"OhMyGAWD ! ! ! THE MAGIC GARDEN is perhaps one of my most vivid '70s childhood memories . Two hippie-worshiping children were there, I am told. Two kids were there. Thursday, November 22, 2013

I am at a loss for words here. There is literally nothing more I could say. And I'm not saying that I think that this book is any better than I did last year, but I'm going to give it another shot. Because that's the way it goes... I really like it. But it is also about people."|0
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it (I think that's the right word). The only problem I got is the film doesn't make it any more than it used to and it seems there's not a whole lot that I don't get. I'm not sure if I'm going to have enough time to get to it again, but that's all I know for a start, so hopefully this post will help some of the guys who have been asking for this film for some time.|0
( WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER ) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of the world has come to fruition with “Sesame Street”, in the title sequence of the movie. (Read on to see the rest of the film.) I am pretty sure that I didn’t mean to scare anyone. But I did say this. I did not have a clue what to do, but I know now that nothing was going to stop me. Anyway. So what do you do? Are you afraid of getting shot?|0
Reanhauer ( Bill Roy ) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, who has died in his arms, in a bid to get the land back to a normal life. His followers believe that this is a sign of his power to bring the land back, that he can control it once and for all, so that the land can be taken from them with the blessing of Heaven. He also thinks that he can make it to the land in an even greater way that would give them some control over the land now, which would bring them to God the Father.|0
I wanted to like this one - the situation was rich, and the setting unusual and interesting. But the story is swamped with childish female gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow. The director is unfairly prejudiced against the 'goy' characters -- content to let them be grotesque cardboard caricatures -- and inexplicably indulgent towards the homewrecking behavior of the heroine. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really dealt with.Feminist film makers will get more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy to the heroine, and start dealing honestly with issues.|1
This is a haunting short film . Both James Franco and Rachel Miner deliver performances that hurt , ring true , and may even be the most important part of the film. But I thought it had a certain spark, and the cast did what they had always done. If you look closely, they’re clearly there. The story was a lot like any movie about a group of kids who get caught up in a world that is being torn apart. But it was an awesome story that was the best part of its set. It was also one I’ll remember for years.|0
I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.|1
"This is my first ""awful"" rating ever on IMDb and I couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. I hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind. I found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator. ""Hell Ride"", directed, written by and starring Larry ""Friend of QT"" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged."|1
This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects . Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing his baseball cap in the outfield, his wife with a rock on her cheek, and his two-year-old daughter with a rock on her foot were all scenes of child-like performance . The only thing we found was that there is no child scene in this movie , or it would have been one of these scenes . I'm sure there were other films about this, but in the end I found the scene of the child playing with the rocks is the only one I liked the most .|0
THE QUICKIE (1 outta 5 stars)Pretty poor movie... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit, passing on his empire to his inept son. Of course, it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit... so a contract is put out on his life. After throwing a big party an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I guess is *never* going to act in anything other than TV movies or low budget direct-to-video trash ever again) is called to the scene.|1
There is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies (I may get to watch another one, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the month is out). For all star John Carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the Third Reich with them, they are not seen to do much at all! ; James Baskett (Uncle Remus from SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) plays their leader, who also serves as Carradine's manservant.|1
"Wow . Just wow . Never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad thing to do? I guess we get a bit of what he was saying when he was saying that he doesn't really think the movies have to go on forever. But I digress . If you've ever watched a horror movie before you may be familiar with this movie, it is actually the opening of the second story, ""Crazy Wolf,"" which I have to say is what I like the most."|0
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.)|1
I first saw this movie in the theater . I was 10 . I just watched it a second time . And now . I'm thinking it's the best movie of the year. If you look back at the first season as a whole and see how much of the movie is the best that you'd find on DVD, you'll see that this is pretty much the same thing. There is a good deal of action that goes on and on. It's hard not to enjoy this movie and feel like you are in the midst of watching some action film again.|0
- Contains 1 spoiler , market with : * * * * * -Not presenting itself as yet another remake of The Hunger Games, it is already one of the most successful game series on the platform. The first and third installments of its franchise are slated to be released in 2016 and 2017 and both have already garnered a strong following in the UK. In other countries, the second installment is currently available in Europe and the Middle East. The game takes place over two years ago, and was first announced as a game for the Xbox 360.|0
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired, it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her. Besides looking as gorgeous as ever, she impresses with her dancing as well. Gene Kelly, who was on loan to Columbia from MGM, matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done. The supporting characters were also competently acted.|1
Chris Morris ' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints , both from the audience and with the publisher, but the new series was a lot of fun. “It was great as a medium for a TV series,” Morris, who began his career in television in 1994, said earlier this year. “But you know how it is when you have your first series, you can only watch it for a couple of hours. You don’t have to see it all. But you’re not even going to like it.|0
We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial age was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.America's projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn.|1
Another Son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner . Technically , it 's horrible . The acting is terrible . The only thing I liked was the sound and the voice, which is awful . But when I was going through the movie and decided to watch the movie , I realized that there are a lot of terrible performances by both actors . I would have loved more, but I am not a fan . I am a big fan of the voice acting too . I prefer to have one . And if you don't believe me , you can watch it .|0
I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Whoops, we made a mistake. It seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart.|1
"There are places for political commentary in film, but ""Masters of Horror"" is not one of them. I get enough of this stuff from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now I've got to watch this in horror movies? C'mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another ""Bush is bad!"" rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his politics, let him go on Air America. And if you must insist on making a ""message"" film, be a little more sly about it."|1
"During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it. Something like: ""Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism? ""So, my comprehension of this movie, was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism. When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this.Strangely enough I haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard it.These are the things I found in ""Four shades of brown"". In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:1."|1
'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975), but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east, her country by birthright, 'Sam & Me' (1991).|1
"It was September 2003 that I heard the BBC were going to resurrect DOCTOR WHO and make it "" Bigger and better "" but I'd heard these rumours in the press before and thought that's all they were - Rumours . But it was then mentioned that Russell T Davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004 Channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role - Christopher Eccleston . Yes that Christopher Eccleston an actor I've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in LET HIM HAVE IT and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true ."|1
Rarely does a film capture such intense drama and emotion . What makes this film so unsettling is that the camera doesn’t take into account any of the different ways in which they have captured this kind of energy. It’s also the movie that I was watching, which is actually the movie that is very much part of it – when you look at the first few images of the camera, you’re taken in the distance. When you’re exposed to the background of the film, you can see that some of these moments are more intense.|0
S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago, Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny. The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film. The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def, Macy Gray, Terrence Dashon Howard, Rosie Perez, Louis Gossett, Jr., Liev Schreiber, Jimmy Smits, Ernie Hudson, Delroy Lindo, and Patricia Wettig.|1
This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.I couldn't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away, as will the young man playing the young lead.I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. The music is a blast, too. Nice selections to represent mood, time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs.|1
I went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming . Boy , was I ever wrong! This movie is based on the life of a serial killer who is actually trying to kill us all so he can get rid of us as we learn what he’s capable of. This is also how the police department and the federal police respond when they get a suspect dead. So the story starts with a young man who just happens to come out of retirement and take over a police department’s office.|0
There were nice characters in here , played by pleasant-looking actors and actresses , plus it had a famous band with many good performers, a nice band with many musicians , and lots of extras. If you were a kid or an adult like me you'd know they were playing some of those bands in here that are famous, but also have great performances, and some of the songs are all good. I'll admit it the audience was nice but not the songs , I guess. And now for what I mean.|0
I believe this film was made for the not so princely sum of £8000 but that didn't really show. There wasn't anything amateurish about the production or the acting, the characters were gritty and real and the location could have been any desert area in the world instead of a not too warm beach just north of Aberdeen. The actors were quite easily acceptable as a bunch of mercenaries stranded on a mysterious, deserted and uncharted planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each-other but were willing to fight to keep themselves and their comrades alive.|1
It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes, cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises.Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children?|1
Leonard can write lyrics, but he sure can't sing. Nor has he had an original idea in his life, just a floater. From the looks of this nasty little puff piece (note that his publishers, McClelland and Stewart were involved in the production), he didn't know how to live, either. The woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical advertisement. While Irving Layton was given a credit, the other poet interviewed, Earle Birney, was to remain nameless.|1
There's only one thing I'm going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate. Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot I completely forgot. Who cares it sucked anyway. i'm not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying.|1
Ninja Hunter (AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous characters, nonsensical plot and lack of any pretensions whatsoever. The makers of this film have given us a truly OTT masterpiece which has to be seen to be believed.The plot centres around Wu Tang villain, Abbot White, who wants to destroy the Shaolin monks and become supreme martial artist. In order to do so, he teams up with a clan of Ninjas, led by three masters  gold lamé ninja, white mustachioed ninja and black ninja  and succeeds in destroying the Shaolin temple and most of its inhabitants.|1
This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches. Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending. But don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly. Only a little unexpectedly, though nothing worth watching the thing through for.From the taciturn and wronged hero, to the Germanic baddy, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) gave some hope of humour, but that came to nothing.I am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film.|1
When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There's Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more similarly to this, there's Godzilla vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. Obviously, the movie's a D-list picture, but, at least come up with a more compelling name, maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it.|1
The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I 've ever seen . Aside from the scenes I'd seen for the first time in years, I've seen almost every scene. The first time you see the Bridge At Remagen it's really not a film, but rather a story of one's own creation, the bridge. In this book you'll see the first time you go to the bridge, just as I did before. I've seen several scenes during the course of this story but this time they are different.|0
When moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting , they flock to the theaters to see how the battle of swords and blades has been portrayed. The video above shows a battle between two characters from a different time and set in a new time.

The film begins in Latvia just after WWI . Being a history teacher , I knew that multinational troops occupied Latvia in 1941-2 , which was the year before the war. I learned about the country’s history and how it has changed and how much damage the country’s military had suffered. My experience has been that it is difficult for people to understand what’s real and what’s not. And I know that to some degree they don’t understand the military’s history, how it was run and how it was used.|0
"I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and works, not an LSD type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. Had it been labelled an ""artsy film"" I wouldn't have purchased the DVD; now I have a DVD that I'll never watch again and who would buy it?"|1
"Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is , in many ways , a modern equivalent of Dickens 's The Dark Knight. It is a time- and time-shifted version of the old '80s novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It was originally published in the US with a foreword by Robert Frost. And it's not for nothing, the author of the bestseller ""A Tale of the Troubles"" is known for being a very good-looking person who has a deep personal connection with writers such as Robert Louis Stevenson."|0
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z.|1
The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies , and let me just tell you-it is not a good watch. There's no way I'm going to win this thing. This is a bad one. Why is it a bad watch, anyway? Oh, you know. It's the worst thing that could ever be said. It's not even close to being that bad. In fact, I doubt you could win this one. I think there's a few more than you and I have in my head.|0
THE NEXT KARATE KID, in my opinion, is an excellent martial arts flick. I thought that Eric (Chris Conrad) and Julie (Hilary Swank) looked good in their prom attire. To me, Ned (Michael Cavalieri) was a real bully. This was because he got Julie in trouble with Principal Wilkes (Eugene Boles). If you ask me, Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside) was a pure a******! This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes.|1
One of the best 'guy ' movies I 've ever seen has to be the Wind and the Lion . . . I 'm not talking about the classic western movies, as such, but an all-out remake with some of the biggest hits ever recorded in the Western industry. If there were a movie I'd rather see, this would be the one. I 'm not talking about the greatest hits of recent years, but some of my favorite classics have since gone before me, as a whole, including the classic The Wizard of Oz, which is a must see (if I'm not mistaken).|0
I really enjoyed this movie . Yes there was disrespect throughout the movie , but Bruce Willis learned , from this , that no matter what it is , if it is the best film ever to ever be seen . I have been watching all this before, and they make this movie so entertaining . I actually loved the scenes in the movie , but that's just what a movie like this needs . I just feel bad for people who had to watch the movies . But if they want a good film , it has to be the best one to ever been seen .|0
That's a weird, weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than David Lynch's one! The special effects are badly made, the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the dominators, but it seems to be a crazy movie, which pays homage to sect kind of organisations. That's surely not the will of Frank Herbert, the author of the six part epic! Check out David Lynch's one, that's the perfect tribute to the novels!|1
"I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it. It still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate.I almost wrote Bonnie Hunt a letter to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real!!! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite line is when Duchovny says ""I miss Elizabeth but I ache for Grace"". Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi are sooooooooooooo the perfect Chicago area couple!!"|1
The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example: When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the rain, I was eagerly anticipating the funny sounds that were going to come out of it. Nothing! Are you kidding me? A truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that, but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly.There were at least 10 other similar situations. Overall, small children will enjoy this, parents will endure it without too much complaining.|1
"Honestly, I don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show. It embraces the elements of the original, while expanding on them. The storytelling has been updated and, while some of the episodes seem to be a bit ""Fast"", that is a good thing.Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Easily as good as Tom Baker.Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela.I like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - No more politicking with the Doctor acting as president emeritus."|1
A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets , created by Jim Henson & Co , have been made , released to the public for DVD, Blu-Ray, and VCR. They are scheduled to be on Blu-ray in early April, and are available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Germany, Austria, France, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, Spain, United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland and Spain. The movies are in the U.S.A. and Canadian territories.|0
I am not familiar with the producer 's other works , but this movie is a piece of crap . I mean it is good , but no one can blame the writer or the director . They did a good job , and made a good project . The writer did an excellent job of writing his movie , the director was very good . That's the way they make it look for the movie itself, and I would say they had something to do with it . Not sure if I am on their side, but that's beside the point .|0
Ice the Limerick:A virus pulled out of the iceJust didn't know how to play nice.If infected you'll killBecause you are ill.The cure is to be infected twice.Ice is a great episode; one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldn't ask for much better throughout the entire series. It starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also. A group of scientists in Alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other.|1
This movie looked like it was rushed to release for some reason . Definitely not a well made movie . But I’m glad the sequel wasn’t one of our favorites . You see, I was waiting to see the release date. I was looking forward to it for a few weeks and it was a while before I realized it had already started. A little while after seeing it, I had gotten an email asking me what was in it. And then I read a few posts about how it was supposed to feel to a certain degree.|0
If you 're looking for a typical war movie , this is not it , so a note to all the film makers, directors and writers of that film . You may think they don't know all the stories they will get from a War movie, or not know any of it. But you have to look at these movies from all the sources you have found and you have to take the fact out of context. 1. You have to find the movie you want and you should ask for it by yourself.|0
Young , ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee ( Rosie Holotik ) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in France. Her parents live in France. The day she arrives to work, she takes off her shoes and wears a pair of white sneakers, while her two older children are helping her in her schoolwork. The two older girls go to France to learn French, then the two older ones go back to France. In the back of her truck, she has to go back to the French countryside to learn French, while her younger ones learn French first.|0
"Ten years before ""The Matrix"" and hot on the heals of ""They Live"" came this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film making. If you like bizarre, unconventional, intellectually challenging, David Lynch meets John Carpenter style movie-making you'll love ""Split"". There are moments of true genius in the framing and cinematography. Look closely at a sequence shot through wine glasses in an art opening party and right after that a scene involving cue cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society who wants to wake us up from the dream."|1
"For anyone who has ever sought happiness, ""Half Empty"" is a must-see. This original cross- cultural musical comedy has hilarious numbers, which make ""The Producers"" seem boringly staid. Writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts on life, wisdom and happiness, even scribbling inspirational comments on index cards as his girlfriend spills her heart out, ending their relationship. When his book on happiness, ""North Star"" finds zero success in the States, his publishers send him to Germany for a book signing tour."|1
Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking....A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! Excellent!However, I was in for a rude awakening. This film can be summed up as follows:Take an episode of the A-Team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as Murdoch, Hannibal, Mr T and Face.|1
"How could anyone who liked the previous JP movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel ? I want to tell you why I'm here - I don't care. I just want you to be able to tell me whether I really think the movie I just saw is really bad. I'll tell you when I have time. Why not just go through the film review process and judge the movie's flaws and make them worse ? It doesn't even have to have to be the bad one. So, the better movie review process is for it not to be ""good""."|0
"*****Spoiler or two, not that is matters******Two things stand out about this movie. First is it's been titled both ""Bruno"" and ""The Dress Code,"" and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that.Second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall. The adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about, nor a topic that I think most people would be interested in."|1
OMG what has Disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. Suite life of Zach and Cody are pretty good but other shows like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place suck and are unwatchable.Naturally Sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. Its about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. There all annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful.|1
Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I had n't known that I would be making this movie before I did I would definitely not have it. It would have been my first experience with that kind of flick. I love that this is not my first feature film, but I know I would do it if I could. If you have never seen it and don't care if you do, then this is a must watch. It's the best I've had. This is also the first of a long series of movies for me that I can really recommend.|0
Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately Zeta-Jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionless in comparison.|1
"A couple of clarifying comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), wherein he touched upon his collaborative efforts with J.G. ""Pat"" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson concocted the ""gore effects"" for THE GRUESOME TWOSOME and a few other Lewis movies in the late 60s. Lewis remarks that whereas 2,000 MANIACS was a ""five gallon"" film (referring to the amount of stage blood required), the Lewis-Patterson productions were ""fifteen gallon"" pictures."|1
I loved this show . I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this guy . The ice cream is creamy, soft and smooth , just the right amount . I think I would like more than a little bit more than this . I know you can buy some ice cream as well . But I'm not trying to judge . You could use a little more if you would like to give the same flavor . Just think of it . It's so simple . It's the easiest ice cream for me to prepare.|0
Yep . Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled . The 80 's and early 90s were also a time when we had to spend the rest of our time playing games . But I don't remember what I thought or even why I was the one playing games with the Sunbow cartoon. I think that was before I had the idea that we could play games by watching cartoons . There was no idea of watching cartoons. There was only a very few games which I watched out of my pocket and the only time I heard or even seen of games was in school.|0
Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama. The lush settings, the haunting music, and plot twists make it a truly interesting film. I had seen it when it first came out on TV. Once more it aired when I had a VCR, but I did not have a chance to tape it. Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the suspense (which is worked in beautifully) I feel the story is unique, and is pretty much true to the book, MRS. MAITLAND'S AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn.|1
Poor Bela Lugosi. Just another day at work. A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort from the inside. It's pretty hard to figure out at first because, while we know these guys are up to something, their method of operation just isn't very clear. I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing. There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero. A police force that doesn't know what is going on. What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house.|1
Gracie (Minnie Driver), a woman in her late twenties, is on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Bob (David Duchovny) has just had the tragedy of losing his wife in an automobile accident. One can guess the outcome. Gracie receives Bob's wife's heart, although they have no knowledge of each other....yet! A year later, Gracie is feeling like a new person while Bob is just beginning to think about his social life. When a friend sets him up on a blind date, Bob finds himself interested in the waitress, Gracie, at the restaurant where the date occurs.|1
There are two things that I noticed in this film . ( This is not a spoiler , just a warning ) . The first is that as the audience watches this film the second is that it makes the film a lot of fun . It's fun to watch, especially after watching it on a television in your own home, but it must also be true as you watch it . As with all movies the first part of the story is the most important part of this one, in that it tells the main characters in such a way that the characters learn a lot of their lessons in the movie.|0
I love this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought the DVDs. And I tune into to watch tonight and I see for some reason you have retooled this great show. And you have taken what made it work and ruined it. You took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love the other characters as well, but they are good in small dozes like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in.|1
I finally watched the third film in Mehta 's trilogy : `` Fire '' . To begin , I 'd like you to visit the second one . But first let's get a few things into your mind right now. First off, the film is an all-new movie. There 's a whole lot to be said here. The first movie is from the first time that the film took place. The first film is made out to a movie set in Russia . First you'll probably get a pretty good idea of what the Russian version of Fire does.|0
This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been primed by corporate head Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal, where Taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. He comes back emtpy handed, having done his duty but having told the truth to the English about his motives.|1
As other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie ( keeping it kid friendly ) FX was not going to be able to do a lot of the damage they did with it because they weren't going to get any damage. I did some research into the effects of the action scenes but I found this movie wasn't supposed to be a horror film and I am not going to be using it anymore as it is now, so there is nothing wrong with the film and I don't think there is a lot of tension with the ending of the film, but the film still looks good.|0
"Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, specifically some of the acting. However I feel that this is probably the most important movie of the ""war on terror"" era. I grew up hating hippies and in some respects I still do. It wasn't until the United States was started down the path of an unnecessary and deceitful war in Iraq that I began to see the world through their eyes. I can feel what they must have felt. Although the film is somewhat dated, watching it brings those uncomfortable emotions about our present situation right to the surface."|1
I watched this mini in the early eighties . Sam Waterson proved himself to be a great actor . In this film, Sam and his girlfriend Kate have sex, but what really sets the scene apart is how much pressure Kate feels to do anything right, and she has no desire to act, even when it means she’d rather be doing so for him. The only person who knows what is happening is Kate. Sam Waterson’s debut feature is a dark film. It’s about four men, each of them trying to find a way to escape the past by making a new plan.|0
"""Problem Child"" was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I didn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue."|1
I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema . In the past couple of years , it seems producers and directors have come together and tried to help the audience learn how to do cinema. Now we want to give some feedback. 1. This is what I would use as a lesson for a future lesson: if you know how to make movies, make sure that you don't get it in the right way and that you do what is right. 2. I hope this answer will be helpful for the audience.|0
Yes this movie features a gal named Jessica who says everything is evil and she causes trees to land on people too (well she only causes a tree to fall once, but she does say everything is evil). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents out rooms to people, but offers little else in the way of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy. Of course they don't know this until the owner of the farm's helpers open the box containing the head.|1
If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston , it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dreyer and the many contributors to this series who have made it possible, both on a personal and global level, to use their talents to help build the foundation for all future work. So it was with no surprise when I watched the first season of the new CBS TV series The Walking Dead. The Walking Dead wasn’t a TV series to be celebrated by its critics, but it wasn’t a show worth celebrating.|0
"The reason why this movie sucks , have these people even read a bible ? Everything in the movie was written by someone other than the author of the movie , not a director . and then I read the whole book ???? I read it , I knew it was bad , but it is the first movie of the book and its not the only one , but if it is any good then this is not a bad movie and not a bad film

i also read it , i didn't know much about it and then i started to study the movie in school ."|0
I really wanted to like this movie . Great cast  Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of the old days. I'm glad it's been released, I know it's been a while, but the quality was so good. The film was great and the acting was so good. I loved the movie, which reminded me of a great version of the movie I saw at the age of 8 and still do. The film was great but I loved the movie and the acting great. The film is really good, but the casting is so good.|0
I attended a screening of 'The Cooler' at the Toronto Film Festival this year. While the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, I must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. The very brave and candid performances by William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clichéd script to have received the green light in years. I don't know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm certain it couldn't have attained the Dante-style depths that this one did.|1
It looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film! But do! I expected nothing from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was hooked from the start! Two interesting premises - A bank robbery gone wrong, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories collide? Just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed, it does a 180 and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot!|1
Thats what this movie really takes . A big piece of cheeze . This movie is about a sister and her relationship with her husband. And it's not about the sex, but about the relationship. The film is not about who you are, but about the relationship. In the movie it has sex scenes, with people, but no sex scenes. In the sex scenes it looks at the life of a woman with a brother, but that relationship doesn't really make it any less beautiful. So what you have to understand is the movie doesn't even have sex scenes.|0
"""Mararía"" really disappointed me. I can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. Dr. Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía?? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?)."|1
"This is one of a rarity of movies , where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it before it reaches your mouth. If you think you will never see it, then you probably need to do it for a while or a bit before it hits your mouth. If you are just looking to watch a movie after it has been so long that you do not want to see any of it then you could do the following:

Turn the light on to watch it on your TV. This will bring it back into play to the light on your TV."|0
The Mummy 's Curse is the last in the series of the Kharis mummy films , and it seems that the mummy has a bad case of lice. The Mummy mummy is the second of Kharis's two mummy films . He is the father of Kharis' son . He is the second son and the eldest son , and the father of the second child. The movie is based upon his name and the names of his family members. About a month before the release of the mummy mummy, the mummy was shot on the eve of its release.|0
Well , at least we have to acknowledge the big Hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive . And I’ve been thinking about it. This is where I have to ask: What are you getting? It’s not a “what’s happening here?” question. What do you get out of that? I think it’s a “what do you get out of these books?” question. In one of my favorites of the last few dozen books, I got a little bit of it.|0
I saw this last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general it was funny and I liked the characters especially Sabrina. The acting is good and the story line was OK except for the ending which left way to many strings dangling and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better.The film did portray rule life really well and we laughed throughout. It has flaws that is for sure but for a first time film for Ash Christian I thought it was good.|1
What on earth happened to RGV? There are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start- first and worst - the music. Every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood, quite pathetically, I might add. Secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working? And finally - if you are going to Indianise the Godfather and Godfather 2 - please realize that a lot of us have seen in.|1
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey we are just like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice.|1
I realize most people do n't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is pitched at that much younger audience than it's a year ago, so it wasn't too much of a surprise either. In fact, the film is much more interesting than a year ago. Kane, who first came to prominence in 1982, was born in Boston and is now a professor of history at Harvard University and a professor of music at the University of Pennsylvania. This is a great place to start considering how the film is doing and how Kane is doing.|0
The movie with its single set , minimal cast , and straightforward photography ( except for a couple of brief scenes ) is going to turn into a horror movie , a movie that should not disappoint. This movie is about a group of friends who work together for a very brief time (called “partners” ) and only when they are asked to share ideas, a few ideas are shared in a group chat . As you will see, when you read the movie , there are few ideas shared and it is a film that should not disappoint.|0
I 'm sorry but I just honestly can not see why anyone would actually like this . It 's stereotypical that if they don 't want to, it 's the least they can do for them. I mean, it could just be a matter of people 've just not wanted to go through what I'm saying and not being able to do anything. In the meantime, they 've decided to just go away from it as soon as it turns around and leave us alone. It's just a matter of people 're going to decide to go away from it, that's ok .|0
This was the next to last film appearance by Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband David McCallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. 'Assassination' seems to be a movie that was tucked into Cannon's production schedule for the sake of Bronson and Ireland.|1
I doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they have it was not intended to be published ... There was one scene in the New York Times, and I doubt if that's the one you're talking about, since that's what the author has said, and it has nothing to do with what you want to do. But there's a lot to say about this scene, and it feels a bit silly, but it's not just silly for me to have to wonder about all this.|0
At Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the goody-goody two shows Lucky Ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough' bad girl cheerleading team of The Demons to beat the dastardly Falcon team who always seems to win at this camp I guess. This being a typical clichéd '80's teen (lame) sex comedy who do you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for it sheer bloody awfulness. Oh and insanely bad dance numbers and the obligatory Japenese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stays with the camp of course).|1
The movie opens with Charlie ( Jeff Daniels ) , a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood grocery. Charlie was supposed to find a house in a neighborhood where he'd like to rent out his room for a while, then he'll be able to sell a house after the rental agency closes. When the office is empty, Charlie buys his first book and starts to walk around the neighborhood. Charlie starts to walk around his neighborhood and then he sees a house that looks a lot like it would look if he were to rent out the house.|0
The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing , in which objects such as DVD and video cassette tapes (VCT) tend to be in a state where they cannot be easily moved out of the box, or even out-of-the-box. One solution that is available is to reduce the number of storage devices that are required for such objects. One way to reduce the storage capacity is to implement a disk controller that moves the disk into position in the storage device. However, this is not feasible in many situations because there are no disk controllers available for disk drives.|0
"I can get over the political parody; even if this was SUPPOSE to be a ""Masters of Horror"" flick.But, what I can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement.To me it was purely insulting to desecrate Arlington, and our heroes. I have family at Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray the Arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke.I'm done with Dante, and done with MOH."|1
This movie contains real animals been killed, like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an crocible been cut open. I find this totally deranged and sick, and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash.This movie is so stupid and daft, that it has no logic at all.There is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie, still don't bother viewing this trash for that, if you want to see boobs and sex, watch a porno instead. There is also rape scenes in this movie, which i found disgusting, like women been raped and cut up, and eaten.|1
Definitely worth renting ! Good clean family entertainment . My 4 and 5 year-olds ( and I ) loved it. Also my 5 year-old ( and I ) loved it. So happy I found this place to rent a cot !! The only thing that bothers me about this place is the fact that I have rented it for a little over a year now. And I have never heard about people wanting to rent their cots but I have rented their cots. I really don't have any idea where else to rent a cot. If I have to rent it I have to use it.|0
A traveling couple ( Horton and Hamilton ) stumble onto the town of Gatlin , where kids have slaughtered the residents. The family who is keeping the kids from the village is on a quest to get out of their home town. The village is in the heart of a city. The Gatlin man was very worried about his wife and kids. However, his wife was very worried for her husband and the two kids. They went to Gatlin to meet with the kids and asked her for some help. The woman said they had to go out to the village.|0

Johnny Crawford is great in this movie of a troubled teen coming of age in a generation that was in a state of teen depression. What a great movie to watch! It’s also funny as well. It’s based on a popular and successful novel by James Fenimore Cooper. Crawford is the only character featured in this movie to have received a nomination for a number of categories. The film itself is very similar to the novel but more character wise. This movie gives you some ideas on what to expect from the story.|0
"The Canterville Ghost (1996).The director made this too sappy a production. Maybe it's the generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. There is a time and place for ""emoting"" and this production does not translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare was very good, but still inappropriate. Would neither recommend nor watch again. The close-ups and padded text and sub-plots were lost on me. Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work. The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue."|1
"This is the worst movie of all-time, no doubt, and Schindler's List, did in fact have more laughs. This, not only, tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great SL is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. I wish I could meet ""Yahoo Serious"" so I could personally throttle him, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he's ever been in. There is also very few things to say about Australia, seeing as they like this stupid fruit."|1
Love the TPB's but this was a lame episode. Didn't have the same feel that the series or the movie has. Looked like it was put together in a hurry. I didn't enjoy it at all. The so-called acting was awful. The cast appeared like they knew this was a money-grab of an episode to get to market quickly. I hope we don't have an easter special next because that will be it for me. The writing of this episode was definitely Mike Clattenburg's worst in the history of this show.|1
The most intense and powerful film I have seen in years . There have been other films before that delved into some of his own. So, this time it’s about a movie. It’s about a little boy (Tomas) who moves in and out of school on the playground at night. When he sees a picture of a little boy playing in the playground he has to take action. And he starts shooting scenes. It’s about a little boy with a very powerful mind. He’s in his early 20s, and he has the best intentions he’s ever had.|0
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see . It started of as a Swedish movie and ended up as a Danish film (and a Danish fairy tale) with a story I didn't read in Norwegian or English, I guess. I thought it was really bad but a movie I really liked. There was a real scene in it and I liked it so much I didn't understand how it would go. I was just trying to understand why it didn't work in Norway and I didn't even read it.|0
It has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Initially, I was struck by the stylized sets, but found the rest slow going and dull. I thought that such a sensational subject needed the Ken Russell treatment to take it way over the top. I now find the enforced restraint (placed on the production by Mishima's widow) to be an asset. Some of the more lurid aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes from his novels. I think it helps to be familiar with the novels - that's what finally made the difference for me.|1
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. It's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen.The music really tied into the story, which made the characters come to life. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast, most notably S. Epatha Merkerson's.I can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer, Ruben Santiago-Hudson.|1
Most awful casting I 've ever seen . Clark Kent as a crack head , a very feminine looking woman , a handsome, beautiful man. I've been to some of these shows, and there's only so many good ones to find, and they're the worst ones to find! A few people may think that I am an idiot, since I have no experience as an actress or actress of any genre, but in my opinion, all of them, and a large percentage of this show's female cast is very, very good.|0
I had to get this movie, since it didn't come to where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see, since they also worked together on the Harry Potter movies.The woman who plays his overbearing, righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is, I think she did a great job playing the role. I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it.|1
I never comment on a film, but I have to say that this was one of the worst films that I have ever seen. I feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! I did not buy the lead actress and felt I was in acting class with her while she was on film. Her decisions were very safe and I feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. The direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves.|1
The trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised : Good campy fun with lots of laughs and good laughs . So what was it that brought them here? Let us know in the comments below! There was no surprise to be found here in the first trailer but that is a great way to see how things work from a trailer perspective. The first trailer is not exactly the same as the trailers in the first film. It is actually more detailed, it has many more scenes and the characters are almost identical in the trailer.|0
ALERT: This review contains major SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to see this film.Judging from the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth one) very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-woman's federation called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring skill and acting ability.|1
"I only wish there was a grade lower than F to give it ! i scored it a 1 in 3, so you can see what they are making out of it :/

If you know anyone with an older grade, I'd be very interested to hear what you thought about this, and I'll tell you what I know: You will know your grade, but I'm not giving it any special consideration, and I'm also not asking for your opinion at this stage of an application, or if I'm being completely wrong, because there is so much more you can do to improve yourself."|0
"The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie. The commercial showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.It is one of the stupidest commercials I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like ""Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,"". When I saw that, I figured it would be yet another lame Lizzie Maguire knockoff by Disney. But I had no idea how bad.Fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the T.V."|1
'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War. This is more of a love story between Helen and Paris, who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different portrayals of the characters, but in this one, they are simply hopelessly in love.) The film is pretty slow-moving in some places, but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well.|1
Ninja Hunter ( AKA Wu Tang vs Ninja ) is pure entertainment from start to finish due to its outrageous soundtrack! I think that this is actually just the beginning, and you will be amazed at how much this will be. In case you weren’t aware of this, you should definitely visit this page on how to create and make your own game, just because it’s very popular! I have to say I have not played this game for years! It’s one of the few games that I have not had a chance to play since I was 17.|0
"I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80's. At first it sounded like a great idea. A retelling of an American classic with the help of modern movie techniques of the day. There was a bit a of a back lash over the treatment of the original ""Lone ranger"", Clayton Moore. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued portraying him self as the real lone ranger. (Moore was performing at children's hospitals as the Lone ranger for sick kids.) To many Americans Clayton Moore was just that the; the one and only lone ranger."|1
Barbara Stanwyck is a sheer delight in this wartime comedy , about a sailor invited to spend Christmas with a German family . There are always a lot of great stories in these stories, so I'll tell the story that you read, but here are three stories that I think can be of interest. You can read it on the internet, but if you read the same page, you'll likely find a lot of the same things going on, in fact . It's about a group of Germans living in Paris on Christmas Eve .|0

This film holds 7.0 rating on IMDb, so even I sensed something rotten in it's synopsis I decided to try it out. What a waste of 100 minutes. First of all, the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. Most of these, in those days were badly done with silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they are still not very good. The Hit, however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly.|1
I would just like to point out (in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD) that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining. These days, with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas, reality shows, etc. it's nice to get lost in a good, cheesy show with entertaining characters. PWOG fits the bill. Was it Emmy material? No, but it was awesome just the same.I also have to put a vote in for the second cast - they were more charismatic than the cast of season one.|1
I loved this movie when I was a teenager . LOVED it . It has n't grown up with me so much but I do want you to remember . I grew up in a family that had many children who had to work, eat and love and I think that was one of the great gifts of being in that family. I grew up on the back of a big family of five. I love being in that family but I grew up in a way that I never really understood. I don't think I was ever like that.|0
In watching this off and on for a few seasons , two things come to mind : One - wondering how it's been going. It's been going for quite some time now, I have no doubt, but a couple of weeks ago, I got an email asking me to check in on what I just read. I think I understand what you mean. So, I'm back with a lot of new information. So let's take a listen to it first, and I'll share it with you.|0
This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots, dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly, but constantly keeps you watching. Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected. Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years. This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings. The performances and characters are well developed, and the cinematography is fantastic.|1
Naruto the Anime TV Series has so far spawned 2 feature length theatre movies, and a third one is coming our way this summer.The first one, which was released in the summer '04 was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of Naruto in an exciting adventure. However, one must be a blind, deaf and one legged chicken to deny that film's faults. Whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable, there were a lot of things that could be improved on. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all of these aspects and excels upon them.The action first of all, was incredibly cinematic.|1
I think this is a pretty good movie , but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me . It starts with a guy who comes to a wedding and is totally shocked and disgusted by the way he looks in this movie . It is pretty entertaining and there is no way to tell what he is actually thinking . All he could think was: I don't even like this wedding . I like this movie . I don't think it has any plot , it is just a movie . You can see it in action , or you can just look around it , but that's about it .|0
As a serious marathoner , I was seriously disappointed in this film . Its target audience is clearly those who are in the right place to get a glimpse into their own lives. As you will see , this was the worst film I had seen on any of my experiences as a marathon runner. It’s quite a shame that it took me so long to get here. I have to confess I didn’t think it was a bad film but when I look back on it, it was just another bad film that could easily have gone on for days .|0
The film is a joy to watch, not just for the plot, which is gripping, but also for the superb performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success, and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what, though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist.|1
First of all , the nature in the movie is beautiful , and there is a bit of Mongolian music. I do think it would be the best way to go forward, because I think this movie is just an extension of a movie. But we will see how it plays out during the movie , and I will take some pictures of how the music will play out, and will try to show you guys where I’m standing. The first scene in the main movie was pretty cool . I was really interested to see what they would do with the song that they just had.|0
Well I guess I know the answer to that question . For the MONEY ! We have been so bombarded by these things that I'm not surprised that they didn't get what I was trying to say. I think the MONEY really does have its own brand. I have nothing to say, but I can't seem to stop thinking about this. I'll be very careful about this. I think I'll just tell him that it's a problem. I won't tell him that. I'll tell him what he can do . I can't.|0
"I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway in 1980. It starred George Hearn and featured most of the other cast principals who appeared in the national touring company production, which was videotaped for TV in Los Angeles in 1982. Last night I watched the new DVD release of the Los Angeles production, although I have owned the videotape for many years. The production and the performances could have hardly been better but the original tape's age showed because both the audio and video quality are below modern standards, even on a newly pressed DVD."|1

I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature . Finally ! ! ! If you are a fan of a film, be it a feature-length docu-drama or a comedy feature, you could be interested in watching the film. If you are an independent filmmaker, you could consider watching the film, and if it’s not a good film, then you might want to watch the movie if you want to learn more about the film. The story follows a young man who works in a military hospital.|0
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie films around, or that they are all the same.Well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other Australian films. It is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud, it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.The casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. The script and the photography (colour/light etc) is wonderful. But more important this is a great film.|1
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is painful, positively painful. The title is apt, in a sense, if aimed at the large studio audience paid to laugh like they were watching the second coming of the Marx Brothers. And trust me, they are paid.As creatively barren as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that NBC brass really have faith in this turkey. Rather, I think THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE is what all of you get who didn't watch, or didn't appreciate STUDIO 60, which previously graced the peacock network's Monday night lineup.|1
One of the worst films I have ever seen ! After watching it i walk out like , what happened ? i went back to the original and i have watched a lot of it, it was great and i loved it. then i changed it to a new and improved version and im still having problems with my eyes when watching the old one. it was a great film and i think there is more of an answer than just one movie. the problem with this version is that there are some things you need to know. i hope you can understand my point about what i am talking about.|0
"It seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. Some manage to do so with great talent. Hervé Hadmar doesn't. On the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very ""décalé"" style. Director Hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. The movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade."|1
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women . His latest play, On My Way to Hell, plays the case of a mother and her daughter who both end in hell and she is forced to face the horrors that are unleashed upon her when they enter a secret place in the heart of a city. After some time I was introduced to a couple of characters and eventually became part of a cast of characters I loved. It was a really fun time as the cast of characters had a little bit of time together as I did.|0
I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it. Made on a micro budget, this black and white digital movie is very much a European film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of DV. The film works because it's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues, yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour. One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other UK realist films, with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes.|1
Synopsis : the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs , Hannibal is a big budget production that totally changes a lot of the way films are directed. It's not just the visuals, the story arc, and the character arc. It's also the very first thing you see in real life, which is pretty much everything you've seen before. What you get as a part of the production is a set of all of the characters, which is not the only thing you have to work on. However, the setting is pretty similar to real life.|0
Well , that was sure a waste of Dave McKean 's talents , was n't it ? Do n't get so far ahead of you ? You do realize, I was at the same point where I realized I wasn't really close to the solution, I would just as well not even have to think about it and just have my thoughts, as it is just what I need . I have been given the chance to work hard and think about how I am going to move forward with my career in the future . So what are my chances in the future?|0
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's,60 's and the 's. Now it's coming to you, it's very, very big and very much bigger. You can't really get rid of it. You may remember that we were the first Canadians in Quebec. It didn't really go on much longer then that, actually. You can find it on my Facebook page, it was released, it came out last month, and it's coming to you, it's coming in all sorts of different ways.|0
First, let me confess that I have not read this particular Balzac novel, so maybe I am directing my cavils unfairly at director and editor. Still my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist, not an obscurantist. This is most certainly a film worth one's while, but one is left sorely puzzled at the end. Was the Colonel a fraud, used by the lawyer for his own ends (or for whose beyond himself); or was the Colonel not a fraud, but used as aforesaid by the lawyer; or did the lawyer truly try to serve the honest Colonel?|1
This one is a poor attempt at spinning the old `` cons turn good '' yarn , which we have been trying to avoid. It's been a good attempt at spinning the new yarn, which I've not used for a few weeks but it doesn't work, and I've been thinking about trying the new one, but the new yarn is a little more stable. If it is stable again, it's not worth much to use this one, so I'm going ahead and just use it for this one.|0
The characterization in this movie is among the worst I've ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and cliché to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. Also, the depiction of the Chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns flawless English from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter.|1
"After watching Stop-Loss , I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker . Gone are the days of ""make me happy"" and ""do nothing,"" in which everyone said: ""Why not try something new . . .?"" ""Make me feel better, make me feel better, make me feel great."" Now I know why I was upset about that movie's ""make me feel great."" It's not like I didn't think I would make it out to be better than I was, and I knew I'd do something about it."|0
`` Hollywood Cavalcade '' is a mildly entertaining 1939 film starring two staples of the 20th Century Fox roster , and it will be available on DVD later this year. The screenplay was written by David Fincher-Hicks, it stars John Wayne, Bill Pullman, and Tom Cruise. It was directed by John Ridley, who produced the movie as well as the screenplay, which was shot from close-up cinematography on the screen. The story revolved around a young man named Ben, who, a year before he died, began a journey to America to save up money for his mother's retirement.|0
Yesterday I watched this tv production , and I was very disappointed.I did n't have big expectations when it was released, and it is very disappointing to see how little people are telling me about this movie. But I am sure it will show that the new Star Wars movies aren't as good as the current movies. I think they should do the same, since they all have better sound. It is a movie that is all the while. It's a movie that is a mess, but it is still a mess.|0
I love dissing this movie . My peers always try their best to defend it , probably out of love but in my opinion you can't blame it on you. But, if you think about it in another way it's really fun . For my first day on the train to the town I had never even heard of this one. I thought to myself, if it's so bad that I'm going to get it all, how can you even think about killing it for good. Anyway, the train is all about getting a ride in a car.|0
"I admit - I was lured to this one from the hype - and I didn't stop to consider the sources. ""one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)"", shocking"", and "" a must have "".Well - I wasted my money. But not all was bad in this movie. THey at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. There is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.But for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting."|1
What an awful movie . Full of cliches , perplexing scenes , very bad acting , and an atrotious script . But it was not the worst movie of the year. It was a better one, because there were so many great things that happened, and it was the best movie that I could have watched. A great movie , but not for me. It wasn't that bad . It was the greatest movie in the world. And that's not to say the movie wasn't good . But that's an opinion . And you know what . It was great .|0
"it's a real big bummer that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video cams nowadays. usually I would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame. and it's also big shame if people like h.p. lovecraft get abused by the likes of this. I rented this ""movie"" cuz of the drop ""h.p. lovecraft"" on it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptions, mainly those done by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to deliver!"|1
"There's only 2 reasons I watch this show...I invested the time already in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all you supposed Sci-Fi fans out there who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some classic Sci-Fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and TV shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these BSG writers are. Their only gimmick is ""who is the fifth cylon"". Poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development."|1
A great performance by Emily Grace ! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious as to how someone would actually be able to see this movie. We had been wanting to see the movie for a long time but had to stop on a day to get the internet service to work. Now that we have the internet service, I have been able to view this movie without any problems on the net. My wife and I have been in the same area for almost 2 years, but they have never been able to access our satellite listing.|0
Just as a reminder to anyone just now reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series , published in 1981 by the New York Times , I want to reiterate that there has been no doubt in the world of the television industry since I began the series writing it for it's readership. It seems obvious, in theory, that the series was written for a time, at least. But for many of its writers, the BBC is not the same. It's just a series in its own right, with a single story, a short story, and a few others.|0
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do . If you have n't seen Oldboy ( or the sympathy trilogy ), or any of the other movies released so far, or if you know what I mean when I say I have no doubt, or what I'm talking about . You don't! Well, I know that there may be a whole world to explore. If you've never heard of him, and if you haven't, you're probably a bit of an idiot too. That's my point. Anyway, if we've found anything, maybe we've found him.|0
As the title suggests there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this film: if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the X factor? This question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way.Matt Damon is the Ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to Europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, Dickie Greenleaf (Law).|1
As I was flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124. It is an urban channel. I saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. I almost became a mass murderer due to this film. I have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of Dookie. The lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. I would rather watch Star Crystal....... Holy cow maybe that is not a good example. The main question I have about this film is... Was it to be a morality film?|1
Ostensibly , Hans ' isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother , a nagging wife , a drunken wife and a poor father . The father , who has lost all his bourgeois values and hopes and dreams , has left his beloved wife, who has now grown to become a man , to make a career , a career . And the mother , the husband , who has lost all her bourgeois values, hopes and dreams have become his own woman . She is now his own woman , a man's wife .|0
This is one of the most laughably bad films I've ever seen. I cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious. Perhaps he was connected with making it. It doesn't have anything going for it. There is no suspense, the acting is dire, the direction hopeless. The music score (?) is three trite notes played ad nauseam. The plot (?) must have taken all of five minutes to write. The dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come up with if asked to do a homework project.|1
In Moscow , the young couple Veronika ( T. Samojlova ) and Boris ( Aleksey Batalov ) are in deep mourning over the deaths of their two children. The two families were last year separated in the city of St. Petersburg, which is situated on the borders between Russia and Ukraine. According to the United Russia, the two children died in a car crash that happened when they had just arrived in Moscow in February 2012. They were the first children of their families in Ukraine to die in the tragedy, and they had just been reunited with their father.|0
This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts . It suits them well . It is an entertaining show, but one that will get you up on the roof, where everyone is laughing and getting out of bed. There is a way to bring your children up to their senses and into the world. I am not saying that Disney Channel has no problem showing what you can get into the world of cartoons. I am saying that Disney is not just the best channel, but the best way to do things.|0
I can't believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website! Have I been issued with the Special Edition naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be housed in Battersea. I'm sorry for all the UK-centric references but if you're elsewhere and you've got no toenails to cut or you haven't got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven't got any paint to watch drying).|1
"I liked this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi-over dramatized view of some of the issues that a BASEBALL player coming to the end of their time in Major League sports must face. I also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently.Overall, it is a good movie to watch on Cable TV or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the ""Dog Day's"" of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away."|1
"""Black Dragons"" is a second feature WWII propaganda film popular at the time. It's not as bad as some would have you believe. A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal Agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to assist him."|1
The Quick and the Undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.Aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing.|1
"( Possible ? ? spoilers included , but nothing critical given away . ) I just watched this classic low-budget webcomic ""The New York Comic Book Show"". The cast is given the title of the show because they wanted to make a better comic. So far I haven't got anything to say, but it's certainly something to chew on. It's not really that I don't enjoy it and I'm happy to oblige. However, I've learned a lot about comics and the comics market from the time I first started watching this show."|0
This proves just how awful the WB Network was in the last few years of its existence . As a fan, I am very proud to be the first one to see this series before it has gone out in the UK. But I think it is very important that we show our appreciation for people like you who are willing to help make your own network better and have a great time making it better. Also, I feel as though there is a reason for that and there is a need for you to show some respect for people that are willing to do that as well as for fans of your network.|0
Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointing Fantasy Action-Adventure film, that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing, poor characterisation and general dullness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth's army fighting in Africa, where he comes face-to-face with the Devil's Reaper  a demon who collects the Devil's debts i.e. souls  refusing to go to hell just yet, he evades the Reaper and starts a new life in an English monastery.|1
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! !This beautiful, charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. I became so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt as if I knew them personally. The storyline is very enchanting, and it brought me to tears in several touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. This one's worth watching more than once, and showing to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?I give this a 10 out of 10!|1
"Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster'. In the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes, when compared to the ones created for the other titles in Criterion's ""Monsters & Madmen"" set), director Day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!"|1
"Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films, and they don't come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the ""Wanted"" signs. The Goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags, from the opening scene at the bread queue, right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. A Keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking, as sound is never something you needed with him."|1

If the following sounds tempting , then by all means rush down to your local Blockbuster and rent this movie on a budget. This movie can be watched for free as well, it has a great sound and has a great sense of humor , especially if you're just in the mood for the movie , it's really worth paying a little bit less than the standard rental fee. You'll also find a number of different genres of music videos to enjoy, many of which are actually quite popular, but none of the movies that are on offer are on offer so you can check them out.|0
As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best one), I was looking forward to see this film. I didn't catch it in cinema though, and after seeing it on to tv I'm terribly happy I resisted buying it on video. Out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst movies in Dutch film history. All the good parts have been left out, the story is changed, not to its benefits. All humour has been cut out.|1
Frank Sinatra starred in this odd little short from RKO that is now in the public domain. The film came out at about the same time the war ended and is a nice plea for religious tolerance.The film begins with Sinatra on stage singing. After leaving the stage, he walks out into the alley and finds a group of kids picking on another because of his religion. Instead of yelling at the boys (or helping them for that matter), Sinatra delivers a nice civics lesson on religious toleration and equates prejudice with fascism.|1
I found this an awfully disappointing experience ! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the moment. I hope it helps you :). I think there will be a few things I would like to do. In particular, I want to have a way to set the font of the font you have created. The font you have created should look somewhat similar to the ones used by the current site. When you create a new document, a new font is displayed. I want to change the width of the font, for example by adding some white space to your font.|0
This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream : Do nothing , be a loser and become an asshole ? But when the film is made , the people that made it are just a few people that don’t want to pay a penny to make a movie that is going to get them to pay a penny.. If they are to make anything at all, that’s a sign that they have a good budget and want to make a movie that is going to get them to actually make something that is going to really make the movie.|0
I was 19 years old when I saw first saw this film , in the theater . I have a great interest in cinema. . . . and I saw a lot of stuff. . . . and it would have made an amazing film if it had made it in the beginning . . . . . but it did not. . . . And when I saw it , the first time I saw it, I felt I was supposed to be the first to have seen it . . . And I thought it was fantastic . . . . .|0
"If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared , Death in Venice would have to become a part of it

"I grew up in New York and this show came on when I was four-years-old . I had half-day kindergarten with the other kids at the time. I was five-year-old at the time and my parents had just finished high school and I had to go to high school again. I had two kids who had to go on vacations and they didn't understand English. So they were in the school and I was just like,, ""Oh, my god. What's this supposed to mean?"" and I got them into classes. I was the only school that could talk English."|0
Significant Spoilers ! This is a sick , disturbing movie ... just like the sick , twisted director , Jennifer Garner is having an awesome time . The director, Michael Gerson has made it very clear that there is nothing good in the movie. I mean ... you get the idea. And it's been a very long while since I watched the last one . ... I've had time on a plane for about 5 days . But I'm sure it's not going to be bad . ... and that the movie should be good . ... in the next few days.|0
"Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy ""The Grissom Gang"", a reworking of the 1948 British film ""No Orchids For Miss Blandish"", has 1920s heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon, that gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in drag. At first, Darby (not very plucky, and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood, but they're onto her."|1
I'm sorry, perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911, perhaps it's an old fashioned story, perhaps it's not meant to knock your socks off but I'm sorry, this film is awful. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least that many clichés. It's a dreary story (impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved) about a fireman. And his dreary life, told in a pointless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style.|1
"This is one awful movie!! Some people told me that it was not that bad actually but I sure disagree! The monster is amazingly cheap (and funny) looking but this is something we all knew I guess. In addition to that, the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible.As bad as it is, this movie as the quality of being entertaining. Not always for the good reasons but it's a good ""so bad that it's fun"" flick.By the way, there's no such thing as ""La Castagne""."|1
"You know sometimes you just gotta have it? That's how this movie is with me. I am almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it is so goofy in some parts, but I find myself reaching for it when I'm down and just need a good laugh...and trust me, I am just not a ""goofy movie"" kinda guy.You can read the synopsis so I don't have to bore you with that, just rest assured, if you like Kelsey Grammer you will probably like this movie.One more thing, be SURE to watch the end credits."|1
How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr@p film. The acting is cr@p and the plot is cr@p. It would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too, most notably the ones featuring the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt) and quality cinematography.|1
"Waters's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope, and then when/if something is found (by sheer chance and lots of luck) it has to be analyzed with a microscope.And after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab's ""rubbish bin for totally useless things"". One single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined.CB is etremely campy, and intentionally so. The usual JW stuff: comic-strip dialogue, simplistic plot, moronically cheerful characters, chewing-gum pop, overacting etc."|1
This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended , I was seething with anger and resentment . This is the last movie in the series in the world , and in my opinion the best movie that the film could have , I would say is this one . I was not sure I could get into the movie but I did after seeing it. And I think the film is still better because it is a very realistic movie, with a lot of moving scenes. It is a must have for any aspiring movie.|0
The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash (the CPUSA was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out). The troubling aspect is the way that it whitewashes the wholly unsavory tactics of the FBI and the UnAmerican Activities Committee. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, warrantless searches - these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the KGB did, and presumably, what the good patriotic Americans were fighting. Yet the FBI did them and didn't bat an eye.|1
My husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than Fatal Frame”. He didn’t want to go that route because that was a bad film, but I think he was the best person to do so. He’d read everything I had read, and he knew it. If you go back and read this film it is a very good film, if you think it’s good then you know that it is. In the film there is a shot that you’ve seen the first three shots in the film.|0
"The first thing you should know about ""Zipperface"" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar ""home-video-ish"" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a ""real"" film. And ""Zipperface"" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a ""real"" serial-killer thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre."|1
I usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as I do watching the film, but with Today You Die, I feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time.So here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is.There was a time in the mid-80s when a single look from Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. If he actually got a hold of you, he would snap you like a twig.These days, although he is still capable of doing considerable damage, he no longer looks the part.|1
"I viewed the movie for a second time on September 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time I saw it. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, especially ""Uncle Benny"". I thought that Fred Carpenter did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. The story line definitely kept your interest and I hope this movie makes it all the way to the top. I felt it moved very smoothly between scenes and the surprise twist at the end, well, lets just say I didn't see it coming."|1
"The series finally hits rock-bottom with this lousy fourth installment , which was ( thank God ) the last one released from the band's current incarnation. It was, to my knowledge, a hit with the rest of the band for two reasons: First of all, there was no reason for this to be an album from the 70s or 80s. Secondly, this is a band whose band name refers to, well, anything else. If you're not familiar with the name, the first thing to say is, is that it's been since ""Fantasia,"" which is what the name implies."|0
What can I say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay themed movies, ever to come out of the UK. I can only imagine the likes of Diana Quick and Georgina Hale, needed the money. What story there is, is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. It's supposed to be based on real life events. Well, all I can say to that one, is that it's an insult to the real life characters. The DVD is out at the moment in the UK.|1
Filmmakers made a rather boring everyman's story look interesting and complex by focusing on his wife back at home. At the same time, we're exposed to a truly original, existential French loner. The film is more than a documentary. Hardly ever do I feel that I've experienced something that's accidentally profound, which makes it all the more profound.Film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers took me on. (Quite a lot of Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen this so that it reaches a wider audience in the USA.|1
I love this movie , first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end of the day is always the end point of the movie and all of us know that we have no idea that the end of this movie means the end of time and that we can't stop thinking about it , the end of the day is always the end of the story , we are just waiting to see when this movie ends and the end of the story is coming up so that we can stop and find out about it .|0
... but had to see just how bad it could get. The plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. A female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in WW3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. The surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'Lesbian Conspiracy'. The entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. Press a few buttons and ding you get a baby.|1
"This is one of those movies that has everything in it. I don't think I would get tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink ""I Never Got to Say Goodbye"", is the song come to life. You will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure. I'm just surprised that I had never seen it before this past weekend. I think that it's positively worth seeing, and your heart will be glowing."|1
"Ham-handed homage to honest hacking. Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography, until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent.Basically a muddled '90s remake of '85's ""Real Genius"", with fewer and stupider geniuses, and a cynical bad ending.Perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it's almost accidental. Or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy. Speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself."|1
Beware, My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to record it and was pleased I did.A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here. It turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer. He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar. He then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside.|1
Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter movies, mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a black comedy of sorts, but there's just one problem: its nauseating. I say this knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is also gross but not like this). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash. The film makes this plan look that easy. I guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash on person.|1
What a shocker . For starters , I could n't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time . On the other hand , the whole thing is so much easier . . . I don't find myself complaining . I feel more comfortable with people's voices . It doesn't matter where the people are , they are still there to listen . And for some strange reason , when I'm on a phone , i can often hear a person shouting into a phone . So I guess it's easier to think that what you're feeling is what's happening .|0
This film is absolutely appalling and awful. It's not low budget, it's a no budget film that makes Ed Wood's movies look like art. The acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything I have ever seen. An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, Woddy Strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism as you would expect from an 80s Italian video nasty. No talent was used to make this film.|1
"This is, per se, an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made? It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.What does the word ""credit"" mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets, and color?Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman."|1
I loved this film , Independent film-making at its best . The cinematography , pacing , rhythm , and acting was all well and good, but I could not put my finger on the obvious problem with the production. What was the problem ? How did we get there? I don’t know, but I would like to see the film . 1. The first film (2-4-5-2-3-2-3-3-2-2-3-1) is the biggest and most ambitious feature to date, with the second film (5-5-4-4-2-2-3-2-2-3-2-4-2-1) being the second biggest film to date, yet it’s also something of a rarity in cinema today.|0
Monster of Mexico I do agree is the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and how predictable it all was. Loch Ness Monster however, is a considerable improvement, with gorgeous animation, honestly Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good, and the plot is well thought out. Plus, there is some great dialogue, and the voice acting was fabulous, with Casey Kasem a consistent delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role.|1
The only good either of the Problem Child films caused was bringing together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. The film opened with a shot of Yasbeck being approached by two women. After a short interval, the film was shown again, this time showing how Yasbeck looked to be in love with her. When the film was shown in theaters in 2002, the story was about an older woman, a prostitute who had just been married to her former husband, John. The movie was very funny, and a lot to remember when it was going to be shown.|0
This movie narrate the story of John Belushi , based of his biography ` Wired ' , wrote by Bob Woodward, about the early days of the Hollywood studio. Belushi's early film career began when he played the lead role at MGM, then worked at the studio for 13 years. After his death in 1993, he started working at the studio as an assistant producer and eventually worked at MGM as an assistant.

Six months after high-school sprinter Laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher Graduation Day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.What it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen Linnea Quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!|1
Dreadful , stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to believe in what they perceive as a free market, but at some point they are just as ignorant about it. It’s not fair, I guess, to pretend it is, but I’ve seen it with other state legislators. What a great article for the topic! I’m so glad it was about the state, but I didn’t know that the people of Louisiana do so for a living!|0
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on TV or I've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. Well, after watching the DVD, I now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much of a mess.ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a first time director and it shows.|1
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way.|1
This is one of those movies the critics really missed the mark on. This movie is practically McHale's Navy for the 90s or Police Academy at sea. Grammer proves he can play roles other than Frasier as he outwits and outfoxes the Navy in order to get his own sub. Rob Schneider is as wormy as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is as funny as usual with almost every line a catch phrase. The movie has a wonderful intelligent plot and a non-predictable script that still surprises me every time I watch it.|1
This film is much the same as Cannibal Holocaust . If it were n't for the needless animal killing in that movie, I wouldn't be in that category. Not that I didn't get it, but I have been getting a lot of comments on the book. But that is just my opinion. For a long time it was assumed that there were a million and one people in the audience who would watch the film. What is known is that there were about 1.1 million and 1.75 million people in the audience. Of course, that wasn't true for the film itself.|0
A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT ( `` scapegoat '' ) for a dangerous escaped murderer.This is the name of the character that you want to use.You want to use Buster, but you don't want to use him. You can always use this character in the movie. You will find it by looking at all the pictures of Buster's face. There will be pictures of Buster and then a scene where Buster is being led out of his apartment. This is all done by the player. They are going to get Buster to leave to go back to jail.|0
I cant believe it! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors, stupid plot and stupid scenes. This should be in 'crappest films of sh*t in earth'. Thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dancing! I laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer Simpson making a movie about a doughnut!|1
I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film. But it didn’t get nominated for the Academy Award itself (because it wasn't) and that made me a little worried. What it did get was a nomination, for the film it’s based upon. And I thought it was a good film. It wasn’t, however, nominated because I had to pick one of the nominated ones.|0
Death in Venice is a movie I need to see once every ten years . It is always different , different . I need to write a movie when I am at work , but I don’t think I’m good at writing anything at the moment. If I were writing an movie , I would read the first page of the movie and read it the second day after. If I am reading the first page of this movie I will read it again the second day after and read it the third day after but this movie will not be the first .|0

My only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie . I think I will go back to that one as I read the article . . . I had seen this one before for the first time . . . Not that I don’t like it. When I looked at the article I found some very nice photos in my library. A very good one . . . I read this one over the course of two weeks ago . . . One more thing I had noticed is that the photo below is in a different size.|0
Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella, the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have gotten any better then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew short comedies could be any good. My favorite ones were Pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods and David arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg. I think over all that David was the funniest one. Its funny when he doesn't make sense. I like the music in the shorts.|1
"""Escape from Hell"" is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is: crass exploitation. The direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera-work during the fight between Cintia Lodetti and Ajita Wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening; also, if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the ""fake plague"" plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it."|1
Where do I begin ? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features, and having seen all of the trailers, I had a vague impression that I wanted to write a book. For that I was going to write a book, based on that special feature. But that is the way the writing is going to work if I am in the right mindset. And this is my goal, so that is why I decided to get into this book -- I want to make sure that I have this book with me.|0
I love this movie ! It has everything ! Bonnie Hunt did a fantastic job co-writing , directing and co-starring in the film. I love it ! This is a good movie !! I am enjoying this movie!! It is so interesting! This is great movie !! I feel that it is a great movie. I have always loved the idea of the movie. It is so cool !! It is not only a great idea but also an important part of the movie !! It is also so interesting. My husband loved it and liked it.|0
"Just what is the point of this film ? It starts off as one film , then changes track , then it ends up one day as the next film and finally in two days there was a single film. But this is the point that is to make a film. We could do it like this :)

I hope you all have a positive experience."|0
The Toxic Avenger, Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with Ron Fazio) had rid his home town Tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this), Toxie now works as a concierge at the 'Tromaville centre for the blind'.|1
I 'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it ca n't be accused of unfair bias. I would say that there is a level of scrutiny that you do not see that is justified in this film. But the work here is very, very good. There are plenty of scenes in it that would go way too far, so you would have to be careful what kind of work it is going to be. You wouldn't want to be caught up with a scene that's not very good, and so it would have been better to be careful.|0
`` Hoppity Goes to Town '' was the second and last full length animated feature made by Max and Dave Hartman and is the only film made in Germany and Italy. It also features several more feature-length animated shorts and shorts of different styles than what has been previously shown by Hoppity. The first released in 2002, was shown on television in Berlin and Germany, and in Italy and Poland. In 2011, Hoppity made a second version of its own, but it was never a feature-length animated film until 2009, when it was presented on television in Berlin and Poland and on radio in the same country.|0
Seriously I do n't get why people are all like `` Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever. In a perfect world we would all be the world's most powerful human. I would still say it's a good movie. For anyone who thinks I've had any luck in the past. But if I were you I wouldn't be able to say that for you. How do I make you believe in me?? I mean I could just go back to your character and say I'm the best thing that ever happened to you in my life!|0
One of the best sitcoms to run on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. Great acting, well paced and an extremely amusing script made this a truly memorable series. The fun filled opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar)gave a very accurate picture of what one could expect. I used to borrow it from my local video library years after Doordarshan had stopped airing it. I wish Indian television would revert back to serials such as these rather than the asinine saas-bahu soaps and reality television which is all its good for these days.|1
I didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy & satire team, as they released their first feature film. More broad satire? Well, we do get four contemporary, exceptionally memorable tales of family pains, generation gaps and fatherhood, in particular. But it's drama, thankfully, and what drama! Epic in its scope, as each episode is from carefully picked, geographically different parts of Sweden. But each story could seriously carry a whole movie, if expanded separately.It's dark, twisted, harrowing, yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed.|1
I mean really, really, REALLY high and this movie has a shot at entertainment. I don't mean regular high, i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches. otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny, and the master of hams Shatner) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies).|1
First off , I never got into Dr. Who until recently . Honestly , I never got the opportunity to play Dr. Who but I did have a couple options in life: I can’t remember when I was a child . I’ve always wanted a role that made me a good teacher . I want to be someone who teaches and helps you with your education . But I also wanted to teach because I knew I would be able to teach . But I’m not sure that’s my right choice . I want to be a good teacher .|0
this film sucks a big one . so many holes in the plot . if the devil is invincible , I think they'll win . Not bad. I'm pretty sure he would have done something similar if he knew what it was he was doing (and why, to his mind, so he could do something) and if he was in control, they would have done that same thing at the same time. He could have just kept playing, and have done it at all, he would have ended up with a better film, and would be better off playing the game again.|0
I love the way he experiments. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and company was. Jatin the new comer also lived up to his role and Nana Patekar was at his best. Suchak was really irritating but I think he fit the character he was playing - he had really ugly teeth. The story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better. I only wish he signs up Urmila for his other up coming movies. I think they are the best director and actress combination I have seen.|1
Went with some friends and one of my friends mom, thinking it would be a good way to start off the spring break, but the movie turned out awful. We all agree it shouldn't have been PG-13. More like R material. Lots of sexual dialog, cussing and referring to boy and girl parts (below the waist). Not worth the time or money. Strongly urge you not to go, or rent it when it comes out. If you do end up going, don't take smaller children. Not the type of movie to see with the family!|1
This noisy , dizzying football film from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well , maybe they are trying to make a better movie of this sort. I'm trying to think of something I'm feeling a bit of. I have to admit I'm starting to lose confidence. I haven't seen this before. I feel like I am in a completely different world. I was watching a movie where I have to look at it to know who I'm watching. But the only way I can understand this is if I have to look at what I want to see.|0

One of my desires is to be a film-maker , and I just have to say there 's no way my wife will not come to me to film the film I made.

So, I am hoping that I will be able to do this type of thing.|0
Mostly uninvolving biblical mumbo-jumbo that drags on for well over two hours. The only thing that saves this film from God's wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is the unintentionally funny dialog, and a good battle scene which comes far too late in the movie. For most of the two hours until the action scenes there is too much talking; the dialog is so inept that the movie just begs to be spoofed by MST3K.George Sanders is absolutely awful; one of the most animated, overly-theatrical performances I've ever seen.|1
"The movie eXistenZ is about a futuristic video game on a ""pod"" system that is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an assassination attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Unless it can be repaired, the many years and 38 million dollars spent on the development will all go to waste. The only way to repair the game however, is to actually go in the game with the only person she feels she can trust(Jude Law). This movie was pretty good, but doesn't really pick up until very late in the film."|1
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing . Guy Rolfe , so fantastic to behold , was taken aback by this . . . he looked back at his puppeteers. . . but not a single one made a difference. It was one of the funniest scenes in his entire career, and he’s certainly never going to make it. But he managed to get a little more laughs than usual . . . which was great . . . which was the whole reason that he made this one . . . this . . .|0
"Certain aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect , specifically some of the acting . However I feel that the idea of punishment is just as important as the person who performs it , and I hope that this book is a good introduction to Punishment Park. Also, it is definitely an entertaining read, but I think you should read it first and read a bit more than you have previously read . So, here are my picks for the first installment of the Punishment Park series :

I have no idea what Punishment Park is actually about. I'm not sure how I could possibly describe the concept."|0
River's Edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history. There were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones I've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters.|1
This movie is not worth anything . I mean , if you want to watch this kind of stuff , you will have to watch it for free . I think it's a great movie that is a great way to start a new year. If you're a fan of movies, you might be surprised that I didn't watch any movies that are as good as mine . I think that's the reason why I love these movies , and that makes me proud of my work , to be able to say that .|0
***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the movie started, I couldn't believe how different it was. At first I was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead...maybe it'll be okay. But then came the rest of the movie. By the time it was over I was furious. Nothing was correct but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden.|1
I didn't understand the people who rated it over 5. I think it's a horrible film from any point of view. Plots, acting, art, dialog, music, whatsoever! I don't mind a low budget..However you have to get some point. Wandering, wondering..pointless..then two boys started kissing in bed. awful,,just awful. I love indie films, don't mind it is slow. However this movie disappointed me from any perspectives. Even the Graffito, not artistic.I was wondering what kind of people would like it.|1
I 'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here . First is from the view of the writer who thinks that there are better films to come from this kind of film . Second is from the fact that I'm going to talk a lot more about him on another blog . He has done a fantastic job in making this film . Now, I realize it's not the type of film to make a film that I want to have in my opinion, but I'm not convinced that he would like it .|0
"The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing, in which objects such as DVD and CD players are steadily decreasing in size. It is obviously much cooler to have a smaller iPod than a larger one. This is not so with theater screens, as is the case with the IMAX, the enormous, widely-known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release, and to this day. As long as the material's right.The main problem with 'Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D"" is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage."|1
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball.Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isn't really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy.This movie is about culture. An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a stern traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they can't, indeed, won't understand one another. It's after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success.|1
This movie reeks . No money , no acting , no nothing . I caught this on on the 3am on the 4am and it's on . When you ask people to buy something, what they say is what you think they buy it. But who does it to? Well it does show you the price you think it is going to be because of the movie, you're telling the audience you're selling it for, but you also say you're selling it because it's something that you're not interested in.|0
I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept, but I wish that I had watched it as a movie, because it is a lot better. I mean, I'm a little bit embarrassed by all the things that I'm seeing, but I've watched it as a thing of beauty and I still think that it's good to watch. The story starts off as I was being rushed home to find the house that was being rented for a friend of mine.|0
Oh man , this movie was toe-cringing bad . Bad look , awful story ... the list of good things has been endless . I mean, who could blame this movie if he and his crew were getting along so well? There were so many nice moments. The main thing that didn’t quite make the movies come close was how the characters were played out in the game, and how each player was interacting with another character. This is one of the reasons that the film has so many of its greatest moments.|0
"`` Landscape after a battle '' opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather poor conditions in the mountains...''
<matt_foy> i see it in ubuntu 12.10 i think - but i don't understand what i'm supposed to show
<frijnl> mr_foy: ok thanks for the info, i'm aware of that, I'm trying to build it with a live cd on a computer that i'm using, and i'm trying to avoid it, so it may not be perfect for me at this time. Is there an easier solution?"|0
Really? Is this necessary? How can somebody make such a film? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the Ending. Completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood!!! Well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be kidding. Steven Segal passes out after a car persecution, and I know he can't act.|1
Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break. The film is average in every way with little more for the viewer. A jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story. None the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard.|1
This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore, but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film.|1
Please do not go see this . I did have several laughs throughout this movie , but they were all so horrible . I did try to make them laugh again but I'm not sure how to get them to respond to each other . I do have to take a break and just get myself into an elevator . . I hope you like it . Let me know if any of you need any help . I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun . And thanks again for watching. I know you don't know what that is , and I know that it's a comedy , not a movie .|0
This movie was so frustrating . Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time . I was able to take care of the house and the apartment , and even did some shopping . But, I didn't know how to make it work . The only thing I knew about was that I had to keep my car on the side of the freeway , which was so I couldn't drive it . What I did have was just a simple two-tone color. I was happy with it and had a couple of questions , but that was the end of the story .|0
I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool . The DVD case touted so many features that you may have been wondering about it. (And yes, this is just a review of it as I said earlier). The DVD was not so great for the price but if you look closely, you will see it is more than worth it. You may have to wait until the next review to get an updated picture of it, but you will get a full picture of what this film looks like.|0
From the makers of Underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie I have ever seen. It is basically a reconstructed version of Underworld, yet lacking vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a BIG deal), and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). A twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate maker named Vivian is currently residing in Romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in America for being werewolves.|1
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.The plot opens with the dream of Ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a Western Anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason.|1
At first I did n't think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky , but as her performance has evolved over the years I have come to appreciate her work, which I could say was a lot of fun, but the reality of her performance is that, at this time, there are so many issues with her performance that I have not had a clue what those issues are. But I have made some positive progress, and as the years go by Lauren is now in the prime of her career and with that I can look forward to her career with great confidence.|0

Sacchi is the best Bogart impersonator ever... dry and droll as Sam Marlowe. The music from award winning composer George Duning [From Here To Eternity, Picnic, The World of Suzie Wong], the cinematography of perfect locations [including the famous Ambassador Hotel] are all right on target as famous tv director Robert Day [Kojak, Streets of San Francisco, The Avengers] guides the most endearing group of well-known character actors through a spoof of every dark detective film every made. See this if you loved all the old serious flicks and have a sense of humor... this one is a hoot.|1

If you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. Alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, Tomcats is certainly interesting. The lovely Jaime Pressly plays the wife of Horatio Sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity.|1
This film is really really bad, it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but I am not sure what. I watched it and was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. There are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie.|1
`` Disappointing '' is the best word I could think for this film , especially considering the glowing reviews it was given. 4.0: 'The Girl Who Fell into Hell'' is a film about a woman who falls into a dark tunnel. She eventually falls in the middle of this dark tunnel and meets a strange man who seems to have had her memory erased, and when he arrives she becomes very upset and asks why she couldn't remember who she's talking to, which she has to tell her story to get to the bottom of it.|0
Who does n't love the muppets ? ! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm feeling in your soul, as the world is getting warmer , because the people in it are warming , they want their lives to be peaceful , so when they get to know the way , the things they do , are getting the most positive things in their lives. When you watch them, it is easy to find out they are doing something very good , but it is not easy , so you have to find the way !|0

Definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over-think their movies. Lots of action, lots of great dialogue (e.g. fun to quote), a little intrigue, and stuff blowing up all over the place. Samuel L Jackson and Geena Davis had great chemistry. Violent, but not gory. The fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn-about.Have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every 3 or 4 months.|1
I was amazed at the quality of this film, particularly after seeing pictures of the barely adult director - all 140(?) lbs of him! Truly, a boy directing a movie about a boy. I look forward to seeing more Luke Eberl films.I did think this one was a bit too long. There was too much time spent showing Connor being unsuccessful (and unwilling) to make a move on Owen. Caleb didn't try hard enough. Owen, being so young, could have easily become closer to Caleb and later decided it wasn't his preference.|1
The submarine used was NOT Varangian ! 'It ' was in fact two boats , P614 and P615 , both from , . They were both from . She had a small cargo boat , B822, which also had a cargo dock , which she had to move out of the sea when the submarine went back. The two boats , P622 and P633 were in a different boat , P635. This one was the largest and the only one she had been in, which was P633, but she also had the second boat, B621, in the same cargo boat as the two other boats, P632.|0
"my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago. and, i must say, this is the single best movie i have ever seen. i mean, woah! ""dude, we better get some brew before this joint closes"" and ""dude, linda's not wearin' a bra again."" what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderfuly original movie, too. i mean, you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same. i mean, exactly! now that's originality."|1
25 August 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen : Sean Connery is one of the all time greats and I have no doubt that many of us will come to regret this. I think that this series has been very successful and it has brought in many wonderful people, but not only is it not a good series, but the main reason for it is that the story has had a significant effect on the character. I think that the ending of this series will be good. I have not finished writing the story myself and I am very pleased to see it come in.|0
Well ... it 's about time ! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that 's his way of telling what happened and his way of letting us into his story. I've not written a book that doesn't talk about his career, and don't know where I'd start. I think he's pretty good at telling stories to fans, though. I'll just say, though, that Van Damme is one of the few who's really got a chance to put the book in perspective, because he has so much in his heart.|0
"I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before I saw this movie . The first 1 hour was amazing . The movie looks awesome . I really hope I didn't read it . But that was not good . It is one of my favourite movies . So I hope I did. I'll keep looking for more videos . Thanks for watching! 1:15 PM

WTF is that girl! She has a perfect hair color and she is blonde. She looks gorgeous. She is a beauty and I really like her as a person."|0
"I'm a big horror film buff, particularly of the 1980's subgenres. Name one  I've probably seen it. Last year, a new little horror movie that seemed to slip under mainstream radar called ""Saw"" was about to hit theaters. I was moderately excited. Having not heard anything about it, I thought it looked quite promising judging by the previews and posters (well, except the back and white ones with the severed hands and feet...those just looked terrible!) I saw the film on opening night. It was one of the worst experiences of my life."|1
Cheezy ? Yep . Poorly filmed ? You betcha . Zero budget ? They proudly claim it on their posters for all to see but you can never find it. Well I’ll be honest you never know the full extent. If you are not on Facebook, I have found one that may or may not have the right image on your wall, but you never know when you might need to get in your car with a camera on you and a phone in it, and even then you never know when you’ll be on the phone.|0
This is a entertaingly bad b-movie . Actually it really is much better quality than a lot of b movies that I've ever seen, but the quality is very, very bad. There are a lot of great trailers and trailers in this one. Also one of my favorites, which I'm sure is going to be a long-awaited one. Here is the review, but I don't know the title, because I've not read it yet, so I'm not going to put it into a text format, but it should read like a standard text box.|0
"Absolutely the best thing I have ever seen on TV . It was both entertaining and informative . The reason I can't believe it , the story , the music , the music and the audience . This was the most I have ever seen on television. I love music and I love the audience . The story , the music , the music and the crowd were all outstanding . I will be back with a review if I'm not here . . . 5 out of 5 stars

I went out to lunch on a Thursday afternoon and my first meal was lunch at a bar that was very crowded."|0
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.From the first few pages I have been writing a book about what it looks like. This is not a film for me. The film is actually a meditation on human experience, and it is not a film. I have written a review of the book itself and I am very happy with what I have found. It sounds like a good idea. I have been to the cinema many times, and in my work I am always impressed by its cinematic beauty.|0
"Walker Texas Ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years . The script for James Bond‘s new film “The Wizard” won’t even make it to video. The film is currently in the works, but in the coming weeks it may be re-titled and released on April 14th. It will be followed by “Joker” and “The Beast,” and you can check them out on Facebook . Written by James Bond. Credit: James Bond

Bond’s film is one of the world’s largest-ever film adaptations of the popular British comic."|0
the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie . the girls were lame and pathetic , i don't know why he did it but its the girls they were so very good and it just wasn't the way the girls were treated at the movies the movies were . This has to come as no surprise since the movie wasn't that bad at all. I think you know the problem though, because there are two scenes, one of the girls is a little wacko and her husband is not so nice.|0
I don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. You got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? And they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? The script already has a hole in it the size of Nebraska, then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot.|1
When the word `` presents '' finds its way into a title , preceded by a famous name , the word is usually shortened by a series of ``*`` and followed by ``` in the name, and the words are usually followed by some other ``` , such as ``` and '' in the names, but the ``` is used only when the names contain a few words. It is important to distinguish two cases, where the ``` and the ``` are separated by a ``` .|0
Being a fan of the series I thought, how bad can the movie be? Well I got my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. The Pete character in the series wasn't a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie. The only good thing in this movie besides the music and that Clare Danes is pretty was that it was short. What's with that dance scene??? The only reason I didn't walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny.|1
As a fan of nearly any period drama, and at that a huge Jane Austen fan, I was horrified by this adaption. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short. It felt hugely rushed and very one-dimensional so that it became boring very quickly. There seemed to be no subtly to the relationships, particularly that of Fanny and Edmund, and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location. Despite having looked forward to the Jane Austen season since Christmas I turned this off after an hour and went to bed.|1
Burt Kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel . Kennedy was a well known good writer and producer, but he also had a large following in the literary world . He was the best-known novelist in America , and in the world of journalism and journalism there is a strong sense of his writing and storytelling that makes him one of the most admired figures of American literature . He was the first major writer to do so in the history of writing & writing , and in the past decade of the last two decades he has been the most admired and honored in the history of publishing .|0
I have a 4yr old daughter , and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses , now she has a 3yr old daughter . I love the movie , but she loves the old Disney princesses more than the new Disney Princesses. I am really excited to see all the new Disney princesses , but they are not all the old Disney Princesses . Now, I am sure that Disney has a lot of new Disney Princesses , and their characters are some of the most exciting and exciting Disney princesses in the world . I love all of them , but they are so new.|0
"I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70's and early 80's and John Candy was a major reason why. He was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious. Unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies. Time after time I was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the ""straight"" role instead of the funny guy. ""Armed and Dangerous"" rarely tries to use John's comedic abilities, or that of Harold Ramis, for that matter."|1
"'Identity . . . . I am part of my surroundings and I became separate from them and it's being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what's inside our identity is everything that's ever happened to us' (Ntozake Shange qtd in ""Fires in the Mirror"").Pieces like Decalogue V used to intimidate me. I felt that if I accepted them, than I would be compromising something. What I thought before really isn't worth getting into. I understand what Naturalism is trying to say."|1
I have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film. You get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face, while the characters are clichéd (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent past etc) and the ending was just weak. It really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, I imagine that caves are dark.|1
When I was a little girl , I absolutely adored The Swan Princess , it was reliving the same fairy tale . It seemed like a fairy tale even though I wasn't really into it until after I found it on my mother’s shelf . My grandmother used to take my mother to the shops so that I could keep a copy for my mother and I would read it in the morning and she’d give it away to me so I wouldn’t get carried away by the thought that I would get it back.|0
I posted on IMDb on this series recently , giving a snail mail address at the commercial arm of the company I work for, a list of all the customers I have had and their name and address. In the end, it worked out that we were both able to work with two people in the same room, and were all doing the same thing over the course of 3 weeks, with no problems on the way. There’s been a number of problems that have arisen, and some of those problems have been a result of the different platforms I have used.|0
"This was one of the slowest movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. After the introduction where we are given the backstory of ""something"" killing a couple people in a farm house, We are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm - AND NOTHING HAPPENS for a looooong time. Then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm AND NOTHING HAPPENS again for a very long time. Then FINALLY the girl of the family has some plotergeist stuff happens. Then some more happens, the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends."|1
At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult, if you love absolutely any film that features animals, especially when they're doing tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this film enough, and I'll gladly watch it again.But boy does it have a lot of problems.|1
"... now please move on because that 's getting on my nerves.Seriously , the man behind brilliant pieces like ``D-Day'' has not made the biggest dent in the whole world, but if he does make the biggest dent in the world now, he'll get the whole thing done. And that's all he's saying to me now. But if he doesn't get the big, huge one done, he'll just have to say ""fuck you, don't tell."" That's not how it should be. That's his attitude."|0
Gritty drama ? Emotionally powerful ? Blah ! The BBC has lost out big time to masterful productions such as the ” ‘B-3’ adaptation of The Walking Dead,” “The Last King”, “I Spy on the Family”, “The Prisoner of Azeris”, “Parks and Recce”, and the “F.I.P.A.I.R.S” films, but not without some big name actors who’ve played them. In the early ’90s there was this guy who had made a movie in the US, and in some ways it is very close to being the most successful of all, the “Big Screen”.|0
"There are movies that are leaders, and movies that are followers. ""Meatballs"" was a leader. And here's one of its followers. ""Party Camp"" is about as interchangeable as any of its brethern who plumbed the depths that ""Meatballs"" (the original) had so successfully mined. Of course, that one had Bill Murray. So, what does ""Party Camp"" have?I'm glad you asked that question.Jewel Sheperd has made these flicks her bread and butter, and what a side dish SHE provides!"|1
Why are there no good reviews ? Because this film is hysterically bad.Set in a Japanese prison camp in World War II and based on a film from the period.I know that I have done well this film,but I think there are good reviews.I really like this film,but I think there are no good reviews and I don't think it is worthy of the review. I would like to be able to see a review for it.I really don't think I would like this movie in the same way I would like a review or something. But I can say that I like this film well.|0
"Think Jumanji but with a death curse . A bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that is being played right now and start playing again . I am so curious as to what this could look like. But for some reason I don’t think Jumanji is a particularly good idea to start a game. Why do people ask? I am curious about how Jumanji will be played. I think this is one of the ways I have played the game. A:

This is a bit vague because I think Jumanji would need to be used in the background."|0
The Mummy's Curse is the last in the series of the Kharis mummy films, and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one. Kharis and his mate Ananka both end up in the bayous of Louisiana, and on his resurrection, he searches out his beloved princess. How they end up in Louisiana isn't made entirely clear, but with various people trying to find them, the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders.The Mummy's Curse was watchable, but it really wasn't anything special. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I'd seen this before.|1
I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung . The acting was over the top. It was no worse than it appeared to be at some point. If I had to pick the next movie I would have to go for the one that does a lot better. What did I miss? There are many reviews here. It was a beautiful scene and the actors were very talented. It was an emotional moment for me. It felt like I had no control over my emotions, and it felt like I had control over the emotions that I had.|0
"Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it's way better than I expected. Those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point, it's not all that great indeed. But it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a maiden voyage. And comparing this one to Sinan Çetin's other films such as the 1st class garbage ""Propaganda"", this movie is pretty damn good.One thing that MUST be said: It deals with the highschool students' life in Turkey VERY realistically!"|1
This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school , early high school age kids . The first time I heard this movie, I looked up to the movie but couldn’t get it. So I was a little hesitant to say anything but let it go that way, because I just wanted to throw this movie out there and let it play out. I couldn’t get the movie and even though I had to look at the trailers to find out what was really happening in the movie, I really didn’t think it would be a success.|0
An expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous African jungle in search of a tasty snack. Some of the most memorable encounters were during the early days of our trip. In the first half of this expedition, our group set off for a safari in the Baguioa region, a trekking destination to which the group had traveled for more than two decades, but has now been found to end up on the ground at the bottom of a jungle jungle, so it is not too soon to tell what they had planned.|0
"As a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is witnessed again when ""Stan"" goes to save subway 4. His shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava. And to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails."|1
"How anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is beyond comprehension.MAE CLARKE's Myra is a far cry from the role as played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the ""Yeah"" responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down."|1
OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class . And some dudes were enrolled just the other day. And if you are the type of person that wants to keep your friends and neighbors occupied , then why bother . You might want to do this because most college students have a real hard time with studying . For example , you may want to read this , but for me personally , the best way to have fun . If you want to get into it, then I have a few things to say about you . But first .|0

This movie does n't have any pretense at being great art , which is good . But it is a great movie for those who think it's great art , for those who feel that it should not be there for any of us to see . But it is also a great movie for us who don't want to miss it . . . We need to see it so that we can make sense of it . . We don't have to see anything in the world , it's just a movie , it's what we'd do it . . .|0
The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in the German Expressionism-style of animation and a hint of modern sensibilities that the German style has become. For that matter, I find it difficult to find much information in German Expressionism about the ways that German Expressionism has been influenced by other languages and styles. So what are you waiting for? Have you ever wondered how and why it is that German Expressionism, with its influences on American language, has had a very long way to go? Let me know if you’ve read this and have any other thoughts on the subject.|0
Sometimes , things should just not be made . And while the set-up seemed good enough , it proceeds to do so by way of a set-up on a different network , that was . For instance, the set-up I described earlier had to be used by multiple users , who needed to find their way into the local system, then switch over to their favorite . If the user is not online , then the only way is to download the new set-up , then turn it online and install the new . Now we know the only way is to . But is there a way ?|0
"This really is a cringe making exercise. Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of ""we're just a bunch of wacky guys"" in the midst of the ""my goodness this can be really dangerous"" parts. Mostly it is just plain dumb. You couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. It is so awful I couldn't bear to watch at times. If my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end I would have had no option but to turn it off.Thing is I'm a John Travolta fan."|1
"This movie is on cable sporadically , and I never really watched it , thinking it would be similar to ""Star Wars."" It was not. The movie is almost certainly on Netflix and Hulu. This was the second movie from Netflix that came out on April 9, 2012. In the past, the film had been in theaters. The first came out on March 2, 2012, and I think this was the first ever movie in the world, because the original film had not yet been released, and that was until the first night of the release date."|0
The final part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image. In Red, imagery is paramount, as well as the obvious but clever color coding. However, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look', Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered, densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red, love and fate are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by.|1
"I walked into a book store in Brentwood , Tennessee . I am not going to say the name because I'm not familiar with the term ""bookstore"". I can read the titles and articles and look at the catalogues on the shelves. The only difference is that in the book store, there are multiple books, so it doesn't change the format of the list. So what does change the list? I think it has a very different format to the one I have in the book store. Is there anything I need to add or change to change the format?"|0

If you Listen to Ween ( The Pod , God/Satan ) , then you know what 's going on with the political and economic establishment in Europe. It's just that Europe has seen a couple of the most radical developments in the last two decades. They have moved towards an even more radical vision, and this is now happening to Europe.

The United States, for all its political, economic and educational advantages, has become, on the one hand, the most progressive and progressive country on the planet.|0
"With a name like `` 10 Commandments '' you would expect a film to be representative of the account in use on a certain point. Why is there such a thing when it can be achieved on a screen? I don't understand. Is it just an illusion, that's the only reason it's possible? ~~~

Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies.Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane.|1
As cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half. I thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching. It was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. Then it somehow just lost that. I wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed it, too.|1
This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have. Over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see.As with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. What I picked up from it is that pimp-hustler Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics.|1

But this isn't just another question of what to say about driving lessons that I've never heard before. What's the point of answering that question?

"The director is sweet, as is his co-directing wife Shira Geffen, but their movie sucks. It has its moments (and some pretty girls), but there is too much of everything: ""Amélie"" meets ""Breaking the waves"" meets ""Pauline at the beach"". You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer, and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens, be it in movies or in real life. Instead, you get a suicidal writer, a neurotic actress and an illegal-immigrant-come-social-worker with a heart of gold."|1
From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights.|1
In Sweet Water , the ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz ( Jim Storm ) is constructing a resort in the middle of the North Sea with the promise of a resort hotel in the North Atlantic, which he plans to build in the winter. The resort will be built on land he is developing in the East Bank of the European Union (EU) after the financial crisis, which was sparked by the global financial crisis. The resort will be the largest hotel development of any in the EU, and it will have an average of about 2,000 employees and 3,000 visitors.|0
"After sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film, and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out after having watched another James Toback-directed mess called ""When Will I Be Loved"", I've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else can these horribly written, painfully-directed pieces of trash get made in the first place.I like Robert Downey Jr., but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse.Heather Graham has to be embarrassed about her zombified performance. Half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a daze.Such a crappy script."|1
An expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous African jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named Diana (luscious brunette looker Katja Biernet, clad solely in a skimpy loincloth that shows off a lot of her hot shapely body) who's worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called the Mabutos. Director/screenwriter Jess Franco crucially fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings, allowing the sluggish pace to crawl along at an often agonizingly slow clip and staging the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache.|1
`` Solomon and Sheba '' was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the old days. For the last few years I've only been working on the first few episodes, because the producers of the first film made me do it, and as a result I didn't have time to spend on the sequel. I think we've been in good form for quite awhile now, but we don't have any new episodes coming out. I'm hoping we'll continue that tradition, and we don't know how long the series will last.|0
This is a tough film to review, since several factors need to be taken into account. Let's filter the more judgmental..Ok, are you interested in the facts concerning the serial killer of Jeffrey Dahmer? Can you withstand an independent, low-budget film? Are you objective enough to NOT dislike a film solely due to its lack of stars or professional look? Well, if you said yes then you should have a mind open enough to handle this one. This film is an almost 100% accurate dramatization of Dahmer's adult life and subsequent murder spree, and is styled as an autobiography.|1
"There 's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some Cheech And Chong material . One of the most common symptoms, which I'll describe as 'sensitization' is a feeling of being too scared of others. I'm talking about the feeling that your friend or acquaintance might be coming into your life, but it can also be associated with you and your parents. Here's how the phenomenon of 'sensitization' can manifest in many different ways:



1. You want to feel as if your friend/sister are talking to you in a normal language."|0

"I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's rather hard to find, despite it being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First off, the ending is a little too neat and ""perfect"". In the last few scenes, until the last five minutes, there is an astounding amount of tension; then, the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up... very unsatisfying. The ending is also overly dramatic, for a Hitchcock film."|1
For once a sequel to `` The Karate Kid '' without Ralph Macchio ! Hilary Swank did an excellent job showing you what she does really well, and what she could do to help you out when you need her. If you can't wait to see it in action, she makes a very good choice as a writer for the series, and that makes it a really, very good series! You'll notice, however, that although this film is quite good in terms of production, it does have a bit of a technical flaw.|0
"The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except that it’s not. I first saw the release of the movie in early December 2012 (I did not know that was the first time I saw it), and I can confirm this, because I was watching the trailer when I did, and was surprised when I watched the trailer a few days before it came out on the big screen:

Carnosaur is an extinct creature from the Cretaceous period of our galaxy and has a variety of adaptations from all around the world."|0
"I must say, when I saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, I figured it was well worth a view. I was sorely disappointed. From nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed FBI agents are, in fact, the killers. Could they have made it any more obvious? If that is the intended ""twist"" in this film, that's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. Pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem."|1
I can not understand why this 1971 Hollywood production is currently only available through an Australian video company , but if the production is good enough for Australia as well then the production is available from the UK or even US. However the Australian version can be available in many countries too. I’m not really sure what the purpose of this would be, but I think there are some advantages to it. If you are wanting to make an anime film you need to prepare for it. I do not want to make a production that is just for anime though.|0
"""Witchery"" is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly, he's one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife...she is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too. It's got some holes, which you can't help but notice, but it remains entertaining throughout.The gore in ""Witchery"" is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag gets ""sucked"" into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast!"|1
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning, it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate.|1
"I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. This is not as bad as The Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. This The Fantastic Four film, complete with the I-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers Doctor Doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue ""Kill him!...Let him go!"" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. The editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides."|1
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god-awful college experiment. It was lousy, slow, and painful to watch. Running time of only about 84 minutes, it felt like three and half hours. The only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing on how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots. Two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever( or what seems like forever), No close-ups!!|1
"OK, so I'am chilling in my room when mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what do I see in her hands? ""SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH"". I thinking it has to be an older horror movie, because there's noway anyone could be stupid enough to name a movie that after The blockbuster hit ""Sleepy Hollow"" starring Johnny Depp. But to my surprise the movie is at least two years older then the original. That alone should have stopped me from putting it into the V.C.R."|1
I am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good . Let me make it clear why I am here. Not all of them have made this movie, but a few. This movie was shot in Mexico. It features a small group of female students and some of them were shot in the US. There are also a few male students who do not have any problem making their own films. You can also get a group of girls who are in college and who have a problem with making movies, but they cannot make anything.|0
I just watched this movie last night . Within 30 minutes of the start , I was hoping it would get a good score , but I did not have that much hope , so how could anyone know it would not get a score in 30 minutes ? I even had a chance to watch that last week , but I got stuck on it and never got a score . It looked like it might not get any score so I am hoping someone will help . Thanks for your time. I think it was the worst movie that I ever saw .|0
In London , the Venetian Carla Borin ( Yuliya Mayarchuk ) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved grandmother. She believes that the apartment could become an important meeting place for all of us who live on the Lower East Side. The apartment is located on the upper floor in the building. What do you think will happen when the apartment is moved? We will be meeting our new owners on Monday. The apartment is situated at the rear of our apartment building. When we are planning to move on and see where we will be spending the day.|0
"...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. I've had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that I have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with ""Gone"" isn't happy with what I had to say. So, I've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: """"Gone"" is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words."|1
This film is bad. Not so bad it is good. Just bad. It is however hilariously bad. I watched it out of some morbid curiosity and never intend to watch it nor any other Chuck Norris film ever again. If you have to choose between this film and death, you should happily choose this film, however, as it is is a masterclass in terrible film making (hence the hilarity).It is a constant depression to me, as I grind away at my desk job, that some people get to be involved in movie-making and decided to produce things such as this.1 out of 10.|1
"Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes , directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins ' . Derek Washington, who can be in the movie if you have to watch it, gives him a few more questions, but all he says he has to say is that there has been ""a great deal of chaos in this film."" But when asked what the worst thing about vampire action movies is, Hall gives this: ""If there was ever a movie that would make people think they could kill vampires, this would be the film."""|0
I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie . Of course as I 'm sure you know that I haven't written it for some years now. I was so happy at the start of the film that I wanted to do it in the first place. But it's a really great film! That was so great and I am not the only one who loved it. I haven't written another movie for it but this one did! The cast was fantastic, I really like the actors, the music, the story, the direction!|0
This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah. It is really just another film about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who they should bed next; the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, as we don't hear the villagers say a word, never mind learn anyone's name, thus they occupy the same 'role' as the 'natives' in old Hollywood films. The movie is also dull, and the story does not actually get us anywhere - except to various bedrooms.|1
Death in Venice is a movie I need to see once every ten years. It is always different, because I am always at a different stage of life.The movie is about art, beauty, longing, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others simply annoying to watch, especially if you have seem them before. Yet I would not want to miss a single frame. The music is repetitive, the main theme of the adagietto from Mahler's fifth is used again and again. Yet I would not want to miss a single note.|1
Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, though seemingly impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to-be-lovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather, is authentic in every scene.|1
"This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel . Here is my review of it:

There’s so much in this story. There are some fantastic moments that have been written in a variety of ways, and I found that there’s not a single bit of them that I liked or heard me say, I’m not a fan of either of the movies in this series that I watch. It’s not like the other books I saw, I never really liked the writing of the others."|0
This was a random rental at the video store . But I was impressed from the start . Wooden Camera, I had bought the camera before . Was that a problem? It’s not a small price to pay to have a good camera. But this is the first time I’ve used a camera since I moved to Toronto. When I used my camera to create an animated video for my TV I decided to go with an iPad (or iPad2) as it had the biggest camera I have ever used.|0
"Follow-up to 1965 's `` My Name Is Barbra '' , and shot in brilliant color , `` Color Me Barbra. ``

##  `` Color Me Barbra. ``

This book is a complete guide to the coloring process. You will need a good book to fill in all the holes you will need. I use this guide in Chapter 3. First, a few basic formulas:

      **2. ** You must have at least two digits in the middle of a line, which means the first one is the first line. **7."|0
This formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. He responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from Knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by John Russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. The plot could have been tightened.|1
"This is almost Ed Wood territory. Yeah, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office. And that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. We get big close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. I guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled Big Mouth might suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking of comedies, all that ""anti-matter"" gobbledy-gook is funnier than anything in a Lewis movie."|1
There seems to be a spectrum of cinema . On the left , there are movies made mostly for entertainment. On the right , there's some movies where there's not so much as a movie. I think it's a good example of how cinema should be used as a way to get people to understand and embrace the movie. The problem is that it is an entertainment system. It does not have to be like that. In any entertainment, people can watch the film, they can read, they can enjoy watching it.|0
Larry Clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully, and to a lesser extent Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. Kids exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched upon similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui.|1
So well done. The photography, sound, music and the performances were the best. It's also an amusing story line that brings a smile to your face with each scene--I loved it and I'm a 60 year old heterosexual guy. Each character seemed to fit their part to a tee. It's the best performance that I've seen from Ms. Capshaw--she's been in more movies than I thought, but this was a wonderful achievement. I suppose it's a plus to have Spielberg money behind you allowing for a fat budget and all the best that money can buy technically.|1
"This movie was pointless. I can't even call it sci-fi, since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space. ""Max Q"" isn't even set in space for the entire movie. The story/plot is unoriginal, the cast isn't anything to write home about, although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film... Furthermore, it's not particularly exciting or well-told. At least it's evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way, in that nothing or no one stands out. Everything is equally bland."|1
I've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him. So even though I had never heard of this film before, when it appeared in my cable TV listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I am so happy that I did! I've read from other reviewers that they don't generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do. I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12, I'm 52 now, and I will probably continue until I'm 92.|1
Okay , sure , this movie is a bit on the hokey side . It 's difficult to take characters apart at once, it's a bit off-putting when you're watching a trailer , but it's one of those movies I would watch for hours , and I 'm not saying there was something wrong with me , but the acting is excellent , and I think it 's that good . I 'm really looking forward to getting to the next part of the story if I 'm not waiting for it to end . If I didn't know what it was, it would 've been pretty cool .|0
Spoof films have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers ' ( 1968 ) said `` Do n't let you go.'' He was asked if he was a good actor. ``Do not let go of your heart.'' He said he hadn't had the chance to do any movie since he was born. The only thing that has happened since is that he had made his first film, a film which never saw him in theater. It had been released to the press, and now the only thing that was ever released was a box of shorts from Mel Brooks which he made.|0
`` Driving Lessons '' sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on , when Grint 's character comes into play. It turns out Grint had a really great family life, with two great older British children. Grint was a good addition to the English-speaking community as an actor, as well as an actor on the British sitcom , and a model. The first couple of decades of Grint's time as British actor were in the early to mid 1960s. It was in these early decades, however, that Grint took over as the voice actor on television, and he became one of the world's best actors.|0
"The 1998 version of ""Psycho"" needed to be set back in the 60's, rather than present day. The headliners would have done a good job with the setting. There were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. The first one was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. Her boss took his client into his office because ""it was air conditioning."" I imagine that the majority of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen)."|1
WOW!! Talk about a film that divides the audience! This is a real love it or loath it kinda movie. Personally I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other reviews are comparing it to Pitch Black - this is kinda dumb as the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be real stupid. No, this film is far more in common with The Thing (how people fail to notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music) Lots of Carpenter touches are there, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless rolling landscapes full of death and things not understood.|1
First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen. I have watched it almost 10 times just because I've wished to spread the deliciously tasteless innards of this film to other unsuspecting victims. It has the captivating essence of a hand-held camera recording of a distant nephew's seventh birthday. It has all the writing of a WWE match. And most of all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece.The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three, drunken teens in the desert.|1
This turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. Yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.Ruter Hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I'm making out, but it sure isn't anything I'd watch again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.|1
This movie is great. 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill makes practically no sense, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I am talking about. That kid's vicous! Although the movie doesn't have much gore, it is entertaining, and for some reason you kind of care about the characters. It also has some nice nudity.|1
I was looking through TV Guide last night and saw a movie starring Heather Grahm on , who I liked. She was on her phone and it looked like a TV show but I didn't get a name for it. And I had never seen a TV show that had someone on its face. It was a TV show called , and I just looked at it, and I can't find it in the library. And I don't like it. I didn't try to find it in the library.|0
Why is it that every time I mention this movie to somebody , I have to hear 10 minutes of my life. If I was to say it is because I am a boy , I say it is because I know I have a right to live. I am a guy , I have a right to live. What do you think that movie would mean in terms of a person’s life? In fact, at first glance I don’t understand what that word means. If I want to have a career, what would you think?|0
Norm(an)ally I don't mind remakes. There are some pretty good ones out there, BUT this one is a stinker! Considering it was practically scene for scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (I'm not one of those who think it has to be B&W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! I don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly.|1
I've tried watching it twice, though I haven't been able to make through either episode. For me, it's basically just not funny. I can tell where I'm suppose to laugh, but I can't. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies like Married...With Children and Family Guy, but this show just doesn't' do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. The commercials made it look interesting, but it isn't.|1
It kicks you in the stomach . There are other films with more convincing characters , a more realistic story, a more interesting character model and more realistic characters . If you get stuck in this one . I am not sure why you have been stuck . You may be thinking that you have read this book because I wrote an article for a company . I don’t really understand what you want to see in your book . I think it is a book . I have read your book , I also know how many people think it is , and I have not read the whole thing .|0
Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. It's not a hallmark of cinema history. What it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another paycheck, and continue to support themselves and their families. As such I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not a lot of big budget films getting made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame American monster flick needs affordable SFX.|1
The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. In fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.At least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. Black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp Lugosi style.The narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch' directed by Russ Meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque.|1
"I was rather disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. It was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. I rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those ""make you squirm"" buttons. Tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can.For those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, Testuo II will likely be a disspointment."|1
Swoon focuses on Leopold and Loeb 's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (mostly) dismissed by critics, not least by a number of her accusers. However, in what is perhaps the most obvious and shocking instance, Loeb is accused of having sexual relations with four women who she believes to be his victims, including two of his co-wives. In fact, Leopold Loeb is a suspect, as one can see by her description. This is the first time that Leopold Loeb was charged, along with the women who she is trying to contact.|0
Yep. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80's Joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. Well written stories, well developed characters. Granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. The movie felt more like a Small Soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force.|1
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which has n't been given the credit it deserves . . . I made a couple of good ones, and the one that made my money, it was good. I'm in a good place. I don't have a lot money. I've already got enough for four hundred pounds. . . So you know, you're gonna have to find out what it is. I've got to find out. . . I can't make it happen . . . I have no money, no clothes .|0
Its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines.... But ill give it a try (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did - to watch this (awful and boring) movie.I like Patrick swayze - he did a excellent performance in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North & South (TV series), but in this movie..... ARGH....This movie is so booooooring, the acting is awful - the script sucks - well.. i cant even find ONE good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING.|1
This is a horrific re-make of the French movie Ma Vie en Rose ( http : //imdb.com/title/tt0119590/ ) . The film was supposed to be based on the book of the same name, by the name of Michel Foucault , and would not have the same title. The book has been shown on DVD by French television stations. On a side note, I am glad to have this film, and that the film was not originally intended as a sequel. The movie is basically based on the book of a new French movie.|0
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid . I loved it . Whilst I watched it a lot I was always very interested to see how much I enjoyed watching it for a variety of reasons . The movie was actually quite interesting in the sense that there was so much to like about it. The plot was fascinating, the dialogue, the cinematography, the cinematography (and even the sound of the music playing on the screen) were fantastic. The music was fantastic. There was also an interesting character that played a huge role in this movie.|0
This movie is great . 80 's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse , so they need to figure out what happened so we can figure out where the kids lives. I loved the film but did not understand how they could have been born under this kind of scenario. It is great to have the children that we know as adults, they are a lot smarter than they were when we were little. We have grown so many, and even though they are so smart we still have to make a decision that they should be more intelligent so we have to look into that.|0
"Look , do n't get me wrong I love independent films but COME ON ! I could barely sit through my last night without falling asleep, I would have to go back to sleep, not to worry about you being awake when I want to talk about it. ;D

You should get into a different hobby, learn something new, work with other people or something like that - I don't work in this kind of way - I have some really great ideas you may want to check out as I am trying to help you out with a problem you may have."|0
"Yet another in the long line of ""Don't"" films of the late 70's and early 80's yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be."|1
Very good film . Very good documentary.Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted scum who is just trying to kill them .Very good .

This film is a very beautiful and slow film. There is nothing Hollywood about it. It is very danish and the characters are very real. It is the first danish film to take up this transsexual theme. It is really about love that has no gender. I would not say it is about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story about love and life.The story pretty much takes place in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense.|1
Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the original film. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a database for movies, not TV shows. But since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which, strangely, is the name this film is listed under on IMDb, I'll leave this comment here.Maybe I missed something, but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series -- which must have been loosely based on this film.|1
This one's as cheesy as they come  the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words, but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen! I tell you I laughed so hard through this thing that I missed out on some of the expository dialogue  then again, the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of Physics and such (at which I've never been any good, in spite of my love of sci-fi movies) that it didn't really matter anyway!|1
This story starts at the end ! So the film's opening credits advise us. Unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical B science fiction movie of the 1950's. The story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.The story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.The scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke.|1
I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was.|1
"How offensive! Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible. I can imagine those at NBC saying, ""OK. Let's make a movie to appease those pesky Christians, but they'll never know the difference if we don't have anything factual or in the correct chronological order."" Well, they were wrong. Anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldn't give it a 0."|1
"MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a ""light, sports comedy"" it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of Capra's finest. At the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game, as it is played in Japan - turned around, with American values cast off and Japanese values imprinted upon the game. (Some of the superficial ""sports comedy"" results from Jack's uncomprehending disbelief at how ""basa-boru"" is played in Japan.)"|1
I've read plenty of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several cinema/TV adaptations but this one we just don't need.Rating is a 2 as I wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. Dull script matched by even duller acting. I've heard Billie Piper is OK in Dr Who (not a fan so can't confirm) but in this she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. This is Austen, it's supposed to be a romance!Please don't let this put you off Austen or historical dramas.|1
"This is on my TV right now ... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this post

Yesterday I was listening to a BBC documentary ... and I decided to check it out... but I'm still going to read the story for myself first and then see what it was like to be in it ... but I'll leave it in a post for you ... and if I can't get it right here I will try to read it... but it'll be a lot more exciting to see it in my new home!"|0
Aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too. It is also true that it was a long-term project to produce some of the film's most talented women as the main women who are in the action. For the sake of simplicity, we'll be describing the film as one of women's film. To illustrate that point, we'll make a few remarks. 1. The women who were in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the prisoners are too. We'll talk a little about each.|0
I 'm a big horror film buff , particularly of the 1980 's subgenres . Name one  I 've made over five years  but I have done a good job of making it, especially in the first six years . . . When I 've made 'em, I was a very good producer . . . You can see in the beginning where the story is going to have to do with one or two movies , but you can't go back and say you made them until you 've had time for the first five . . .|0
I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this film. If she was supposed to be a depressive, I think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because Ricci's character was more a depiction of a self-centered, worthless sh!tbag than a victim and survivor of depression.The forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her. Sorry but I couldn't buy it. This is straight to video schlock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.|1
This film works on a lot of different levels . It 's a profile of one very cool couple , from a film that I have seen at the film festival in France . I was there watching this show . It had a little bit of an all-encompassing premise, that in itself was amazing . It was one of the first things that I thought would make sense for a documentary . But after watching a few hours, I started thinking about what they had planned for me to do . I started thinking, ' I would love that.' How did you get started?|0
"This is a pretty simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an Oscar nom. Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI. She is the ""daughter of the regiment"", loved as a little sister. Into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, Gary Cooper."|1
There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar. Its so nice to see this wonderful film again and I actually got hold of a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.I got a very good copy by a company called Flashbacks and its quite good. In the old days I watched it on black and white on TV and its magic to see it in colour. Very much better than some would have you believe. The songs are delightful and the colour is great.|1
"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species."|1
I love this show . I watched every episode last year . I bought the DVDs . And I tune in every episode . I love how they have a character who has to make a movie . All the characters that were made and are made by the people in the world are wonderful. As a kid, I can’t believe that every character that I got is on their own. If I wanted to see a character like this, I could go for it, but I need to do it because I like the characters so much and I also love that their character is so great .|0
This movie was beyond awful , it was a pimple on the a * s of the movie industry . It was the last thing that they did . The movie had nothing to show the audience . It had a bad attitude and a bad voice . It's not the only thing that was awful , the worst of these movies is the worst , it was so awful that people could only watch it once . There were some people who thought it was awful . This is probably a reflection of what people said to the audience . This movie had no personality .|0
The most obvious flaw...horrible, horrible script. This movie had a potentially good story, but it was ruined with bad dialogue, continuity problems, things that were never explained, gaping plotholes, sub-plots that went nowhere, and just plain stupidity. Not to mention the awful, cliched directing of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could've saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give horrific performances. The thing is, they're better actors than this movie would have you believe.|1
Dreadful . I hope I can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this . I don’t need to be reminded every time. . Oh, thank you Lord. I don't need to be reminded. . Now I want to thank you for every day you've had this month, and I have to say it's great, very great. Yes, thank you for every time you've felt like I'm back, so glad I could do more. And I can say that I am grateful for you, my dear, my family, and the world.|0
"There 's only 2 reasons I watch this show ... I invested the time already in previous episodes and Columbo has an incredible cast. The first is for Columbo, who has been around since the very first episode but the second for him, who has to make the second appearance. If you haven’t already made your first appearance before, I’ll take a look at it before I tell you about that.”



If you’re not sure what Columbo’s name was, I’m sure he can answer that, if not, then what do I know about it?"|0
One of the worst films I have ever seen! After watching it i walk out like, what happened? I am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. First,I can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.Because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! This movie isn't scary at all! There is even no Typical horror clichés,too. The plot and acting of This movie was terrible.|1
This is a wonderful comedy short -- one of Keaton 's absolute best . Through a long series of silly and humorous scenes, we hope to create a bit of something for everyone, whether you are a geek or a person of colour. In it you have a little fun with making a joke. If you would like to play a joke, there's lots of things to do. You may also like to see what people have to say, or what other funny things are in the show. If you do not, then please don't read these comments.|0
I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs, that a charlatan and fraud of Gurdjieff's caliber (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; there is no denying he had a special gift. It's a pity he misused it, though, for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity.|1
I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi , but this movie is just not good . The main reason is that Koyaanisqatsi has the bad ass attitude to Powaqqatsi. He will never make the move to the bad side, but Powaqqatsi also has the same problem because Koyaanisqatsi is more mature than him, which is why Powaqqatsi is the best move. It's also because Powaqqatsi can't handle more than 10 movies per day, and if you want a better movie you can try this movie on the other side of the fence. It would be much better if Powaqqatsi makes the moves.|0
"Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as ""The Fox"" in ""Whistling in the Dark,"" also starring Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Grey and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, aka ""The Fox"" finds his plans to marry his fiancé Carol (Rutherford) thwarted when he's kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew, who is going to be living off of the interest."|1
The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel `` Nanny '' Crosby , who runs a boardinghouse and provides food and support for those with a need. In the early 20th century, she became one of America's foremost leaders and was recognized by many as a woman who had a great deal of charm and potential. She became known as the wife of Major League Baseball's all-time player of all-time. In the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, North American Indians' success in the Negro League meant that they were a powerful force on the national stage.|0
Fans of Euro-horror flicks - Portland 's video/DVD store Movie Madness has a whole section devoted to this genre - where it's easy to see how the games themselves are made in Portland - and I think you get what you are getting. They are the best games in the UK. I was going to show you just how easy this is to use. I've got the video here and you can play it as well but you can also go to the website for free. This is a very nice video. I'm going to show you this section but I'm not sure why.|0
This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror, so far this season Masters of Horror has produced one really good episode...The Damned Thing...it is still early, I have faith that the episodes will get better. I admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline. The episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring, but the last fifteen minutes was really good. Though, I am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first season's episodes possessed. Please, save this season John Carpenter!|1
It 's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon-like epic that for some reason has become a huge hit. It's an art piece, and it needs to remain so, for what? To make it good, to do it well, and to do it well. The reason is that it shows a cartoon-like way of working. (And that's just the beginning.) It does, but it does so well. It does a lot, and at the same time that you need to learn the fundamentals of animation, you need to master it well.|0
Are you kidding me? This is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Drew around was nothing more than comical. When I herd about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. But this movie just destroyed that.|1
MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson's finest and most personal films. It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one 'misunderstood,' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's snappy screenplay and Paul Williams's knockout songs. Now while these things are admittedly great, as is the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay, film break, etc. ), what distinguishes 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious, wistful thread that runs through the picture.|1
"This movie had an excellent premise , and could have been a fascinating look at racism , attitudes to women and how they get in the way. But it’s not the only movie in my top 10, and it’s worth watching in its own right if you want to read more about the subject, but it’s also worth seeing in some detail as well if you’re not interested in how these movies are constructed. 1. The Dark Side of Comedy

I actually love the “Dark Side Of Comedy” comic book of the time."|0
As the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.From the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest I didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a Shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.I have never, and I mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and I watch tons of crap films.Turd.|1
"I agree with all the comments posted so far: This movie was a waste of time and energy, for viewers as well as those who made it. Terrible CGI, awful script, stupid plot and hey, the setting is Alabama but it looks like California. But the worst thing has got to be the Native American angle on this, which pulls in every stereotype you can think of, from the chief surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, people speaking without using contractions (""Do not do this thing! ""), Native American pipes playing in thin air, etc."|1
I absolutely adore this film about a lady columnist ( Barbara Stanwyck ) for a major homemaking magazine who delivers her recipes. If you have any idea what I’ve done in this last year, I would probably be surprised by the comments from people who aren’t quite the same as Barbara Stanwyck. In this film, Barbara Stanwyck uses her husband’s skills to develop new recipes. And here’s what she said about the recipes. “I make a few of the recipes online and I like the process very well. I try to make sure that they are up to date.|0
Okay, that was just brilliant. I wish that the rest of Season 1 had been this strong. It really needed more episodes like this. The cast worked perfectly, even though they were all nobodies back in the day. Writing was fantastic and so was the editing. Great job in all accounts. The episode was thrilling, suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end. Which is what most MOTW episodes had tried, but failed until now. The first FIVE star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember it being this good.|1
I first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995, I dismissed it offhand, saying that Julie was no Daniel, never really giving it a chance and saying it was horrid.But here it is, 5 years later, its on Disney and im watching it again. And I'm finding that it isnt as bad as I made it out to be. Miyagi is still Miyagi, just as kool as ever, the musical score is still there pleasant as ever. And Swank's character isnt that bad, her acting is pretty good considering the script.|1
Set in Hungary in November 1956 , this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to enter the country from Austria, Germany and England in the late 1980's. There they were forced to live in Austria, where most of their belongings would be taken care of for the next two years. They arrived in Prague in September of 1956 to find they had made it and they had to share the food with their friends, family and friends. On September 16, 1956, the following year, there was a revolution of the Hungarian Communist Party.|0
The first episode of 'Man to Man with Dean Learner ' that just aired was at least up to scratch. I was in a bad mood from the beginning and wanted to take a bit of a break before I did that. I was not expecting the show to take off right after it had finished and I felt a bit bored. I'm not sure why but it did at least give me some hope. I got the opportunity to watch the first episode but I think I was a bit tired of the previous episode. I don't know what was going to happen at that point.|0
This movie actually almost made me cry.For starters the fake teeth. Then you spot a nice plastic or drawn set. To make it even more boring all the action is followed by a bright light flash. Then the talking: sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never exactly good like in good movies. Also, it echoes so much that i think they had one microphone on the entire set. And to make matters worse, EVER heard of stereo? If the camera switches, the sound always stays centered.|1
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best. She's all wrapped in horror & suspense here, a type of role that suits her very well.This mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from Paul Verhoeven's 'Basic Instinct' (1992), by the way. However, there are differences between the main female characters of Traci Lords ('99) and that of Sharon Stone ('92). For instance, in Extramarital Traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. We also shouldn't forget mentioning Extramarital's three main actors.|1
The TV show was slow moving and the 'offbeat' characters were sometimes irritating. Only through the miracle of fast forward was I able to make it through the first 2 hours. The write-up indicates that it's some kind of comedy/mystery but I didn't see much of either. If it really picks up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I doubt that I will watch the rest without a recommendation.This review is supposed to be without spoilers so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic.|1
Strange , often effective hippie zombie flick , starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby , this is a one night stand that should be watched at least once a week , unless of course you’ve had a bad week! This weekend’s flick is the best of the bunch. It should be an all day long show of the shows by the group. It’s not just a great show, it’s the best. They really have the talent to really do the show together, even if it has been for years.|0
Move over Manos. Back off Boogens. It doesn't take a Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampires (MBV for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to Zarkorr The Invader) the worst film ever. The only horror in this thing is watching it. I wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. If this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. It's dreck. No wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck.|1
no really, im not kidding around here folks, and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews! oh wait, its the IMDB comments section, silly me. its interesting to note that at this date, there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten, yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film. what does this mean i wonder? anyway, the script IS terrible. character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene, in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely resembled a pace.|1
It is terrible ! It is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $ 30 and told her to use it ! She cried so loud she just had to take it back and she got fired ! She was in no mood to give her child the camera ! I am in love with my daughter ! ! In the video, you can see how it is that a young lady used a faulty video camera because of a lack of use. But you can see that for a girl that needs a camera, the video is faulty and it is very bad.|0
"I was expecting this movie to be a stinker but I wanted to see for myself, but I was surprised how good of a movie this was. I know longer movies often don't do well at the box office but why this was pulled and not allowed to be viewed by the public is beyond me. It maintained my interest throughout and the scenery and photography is breathtaking at times. The plot was good and the morality play was a good one. I liked the realism which was along the lines of ""Unforgiven"". I had to rent this movie to see it but it was definitely worth it."|1
I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings , but that is n't saying much.The plot is good, but the story isn't at all good either. There are some great new characters in the game. I know most of them are new to this forum, but I am curious as to the reasons for their popularity. I'd love to have a discussion on why some of these are not good. I know some of them are interesting and should have a chance to comment before I go down this rabbit hole.|0
Watched this film at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film. A simple, uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions. It neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language. A real family film and the best British comedy film I've seen since Billy Elliot.The film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.|1
to make this short and sweet : i hope this movie will not be considered the seminal work for the cinema in the next few years : i am going to look into this movie but i would really like to see the release date before it is available on the internet but i am not sure if this will make it worth the wait : let me know if you guys have any suggestions for a new film :). I would love to get this movie for you : I would love to see the new trailer. That's an idea of mine.|0
"When a movie called Hell Ride comes out you expect a certain amount of biker cliché. With character names like ""Pistolero"", ""Comanche"" and ""The Gent"" I braced myself for the worse and was punch in the face by just that. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. Dusty desert blurred from the heat as bikes coming tearing down the road while ""CC Rider"" plays and they talk about sex and violence. Yawn! The three leads were just ridiculous and unbelievable."|1
Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. If your thinking about watching this because your a Sandra Bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious.|1
"You know, this is one of those ""Emperor's New Clothes"" films. It's like, so off the wall and strange that you're SUPPOSED to like it if you're really into film. Well, I think that's a bunch of bologna. Films like this which hide under the cloak of Dada or surrealism make me nuts. Some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius."|1
"this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a ""is this for real??"" sort of way. it was so cheesy and low budget...they should not have even bothered. there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence, and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it (think ketchup as blood, and cabbages for severed heads). do not rent this! !"|1
I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought, despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I got home I raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed. While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters are changed (ie Finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas Gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or altogether changed (ie.|1
At the beginning of the movie , Ramgopal Verma says that `` Sarkar '' is his tribute to The Godfather '' and says, ``I didn't really have a problem when I met him,'' and then he says, ``and then he says, 'You've got to get a job at this, Ramgopal Verma.''''' After this, after a while, Ramgopal says, ''he didn't think about it.'' ''After that,' he asks, ''what did he think about it?' '''' ... ''Ramgopal Verma says ''nothing.''''|0
"I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager . I grew up with the Sesame Street theme. It's funny and fun , I love it . I've also read it and I can't find the name of it . Now I'm reading a lot of great movies. The one I want to learn is ""Star Trek"". I love the story, but I think it would be better if we read that one. Maybe I can get a better description. A lot of the information on TV and movie books comes from my own experience with them."|0
"Hearkening back to those ""Good Old Days"" of 1971, we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole Season of Charles Chaplin at the Cinema. That's what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody's old talk show. (We can't recall just whose it was; either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest talked about Sir Charles' career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the 1952 exclusion of the former ""Little Tramp' from Los Estados Unidos on the grounds of his being an ""undesirable Alien""."|1
"I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film . . . . but I thought it wasn't quite as exciting as I suspected. It was, after all, more exciting than most films. I watched it the next day. I got to see it more than once—the screen was about four feet in size—but it was not the kind of movie that made me want to look for it. ""Well, I guess there is nothing more exciting for me to be looking at than a movie,"" he said."|0
I saw this movie on a show that was showing bad B-movies and trying to get you to buy them, I asked for help with this because I had no money at the time, but I didn't know any of the guys I worked with and had a lot of money in the bank to get started. The guy that had been there earlier said he would make the first buy for me and give me 50 bucks if they could get it for free, and I thought that would give me a chance to get my money back, and I didn't get that.|0
"... and I Bought A Vampire Motorcycle staggers all over that line like a drunk with his shoelaces tied together, and then it's not the only way. He's a vampire who is on the brink of becoming an adulteress. That's the real reason I bought him."" He lowered the gun on his right shoulder. ""I know how it works. I'm the only one here who can tell you how to handle this."" He glanced down his spine. ""I've been working my whole life to get out of this, to get back out there in this condition."|0
The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat a haunted house party. They’ve got a creepy spirit who wants to haunt the ghost. They invite the people of the city to take part in a ghost hunt to try their hand. They even take a look inside the ghostly house. After the hunt, they have a group that gathers the people to go outside. They’ll head for the haunted house when the lights are on so they’ll come back, but the spirits of the ghosts would rather spend the day visiting the ghost.|0
This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world . The social criticism of our shallow , bourgeois-looking world and its social and economic failures is, of course, an illusion . And this is the way we have to navigate this problem. But it is still the way. I will use the analogy of the English language to explain my point. The real world is always much less than the virtual world we have become accustomed to. But it is still very much, far, beyond the virtual world. We are always in that virtual reality, and we are living in it.|0
OK , when I say `` wow , '' I mean , `` Jesus , please help me .

However, when you look at the page, it looks a very similar to those you've seen before because of the small font.

Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar . One of Hollywood 's handsome leading men . Married with children, he worked as a photographer for The New Yorker magazine and won three Oscar awards, including a Best Picture prize. He died at the age of 95 on February 17, 2010 in New York City. During that time he wrote for the New Yorker magazine and appeared at numerous awards shows, including the 2008 Best Picture, and was also nominated for an Oscar in 2005. In the process of retiring from television, he became involved in a variety of activities.|0
"This film has recently been televised by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered racy in its time, and may have made money, but even the most die-hard Jane Russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck.There are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time, even though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot. ""The French Line"", however, fails at all of these aspects.It doesn't matter that Russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material."|1
Pure schlock from beginning to end. The average 12 year old might find that it has an interesting take on discrimination. Otherwise, it's a pure camp-fest endurance test. Like one of those so-so episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation that thinks it has Something Important To Say.You'll see every plot twist a mile off in this by-the-numbers romp. However, it's worth seeing for its portrayal of drag-king prostitutes, a brothel where young women pay old men to have sex with them (how's that for role reversal), and lesbian soap operas. The ghost of Valerie Solanis lives!|1
It is n't TOO bad , but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.The jokes are few and far between. There are few that can match the variety of characters. If you are on a tight budget, it's a good idea to get your money's worth and find a way to put them right. I like the way the story's structure has been written in Australia. It has a nice premise, there are strong elements that go beyond just the story, and the characters in the story are strong enough in themselves to take on a significant amount of their own role.|0
"the actors can not act . all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character . Channing Tatum, one of her favorite actors , was a brilliant actor , one who acted on the stage like a pro. The actor who was most famous for his voice and voice acting was John Singleton (1911–1983) who was known as one of the most popular voice actors in the United Kingdom . He had also appeared in many films and TV commercials. Among his other famous works were ""The Sound of Music"" [1942], and ""The Sound of the Piano"" [1955]."|0
This movie was cheesy and it was more than that. It was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla: she is now the wife of the gorilla. She should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense. There are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave.|1
"Wayne Wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than ""Slums of Beverly Hills"", which covers remarkably similar ground. The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry there. This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent. She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic."|1
"I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two. It's not that I don't ""get it"" -- I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is, the movie is infantile in construction, long-winded, and painfully disjointed.I suppose that if you are of Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought ""Don't tell them, show them,"" then you could try to appreciate this movie, but you would still be hard pressed.First of all, The Terrorizers tries stream-of-consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in this."|1
There could be some SPOILERS AHEAD but I doubt it . I have no idea how the screenplay for this is supposed to look at the time, just a couple of lines. The character is just a kid from a small town who wants to go to war, but has no clue how the war will actually work. It's not even a great movie. The plot is so awful and I've been to many movies in my lifetime that I just couldn't get my head around it. There are so many great movies to come.|0
I have always loved The Muppets . Though most children 's entertainment then was n't that likable , The Muppet World , was an excellent show at the end of the day, it was entertaining at night , the characters are real , well presented and there are some memorable moments . The cast is excellent , there are some memorable moments , all the time a great audience would like to know about the story , I would greatly recommend The Muppets . I can't wait until the next installment . I hope that the movie goes down in flames , the movie will never be a success , even if its next week .|0
"My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belphégor in the French 60 's ... and I hope I won't ever forget the time when I couldn't even remember all those words from the time when I was a child."" ""I suppose it's a very sad story. There was one person, not all of us, who was in danger from a group of children who had lost their mother because they had heard about their mother's murder."" ""How did the children die? I have never heard anyone describe the deaths of people who had been in danger."|0
"This film, for what it was set out to be, succeeded. It's a short tragic film. Although my choice of film are ones that really develop characters and their relationships, this film is meant to just give a taste, leaving you with the ""what happens next"" factor. After watching it, I really was wanting more, more of the characters back story, what influences they had to make them into the people they were. I think thats what the makers intended the viewing audience to think. The acting is amazing."|1
"As a word of explanation, Disney's ""The Kid"" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, though unbelievable, feel good family comedy as only the folks at Disney can provide. Bruce Willis, in a change of pace, plays a self-centered stuffed shirt of an ""Image Consultant"". He degrades, not only his clients, but those close to him as well. You know that he is going to have to change before the final credits."|1
Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; her uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), miffed that he wasn't left the business to run, orders a hit on his niece. When jug-eared chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her.|1
"If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: ME: ""Four boys at a private high school are good friends, AND they are witches. ""Hollywood: ""That sounds like ""The Craft."" ME: ""No, no, I said four boys, not four girls."" Hollywood: ""That still sounds like ""The Craft"", just with boys instead of girls."" ME: ""OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power."|1
"`` Lets swap Murders- your wife , my father '' - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony, an ex-girlfriend, and my husband. Murders are an emotional and personal issue. You must understand that the words ""Murders"", ""Murderers,"" and ""Murderers' and ""Murdered"" mean you are not the only one, and this is particularly true of you. I would love to hear what your friends have to say about them. Let me tell you a little something you should know about me and my friends."|0
"The only reason I checked this film out was to see the `` early '' Kim Bassinger . That , which is a really long film and it has to be called `` '' '' The '' first film from the early years was '' '' ''

You will see, I am sure that the director of the film was not aware of all the events of that film in any way. As far as I can tell, it had nothing to do with the character, it was just that there were no scenes in that film, and there were no characters there as a result."|0
Shtrafbat is the story only Russians could tell about the Second World War. The largest front of the whole conflict has been, ironically, the least appearing subject on the silver screen after the war. While the Western Allies war-effort has been pictured in almost every possible detail and manner, the East has been left out or the job has been left to only some old propaganda movies of little else than historical footage value.There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with Band of Brothers in every detail but neither you want to look at the screen with examining petty visual effects in mind.|1
There are a whole lot of movies , primarily from the 80s , that are so terrible that you caress them in your mouth. Some of them seem to work but the rest of them aren't. I can see why you would want to be the one to do it. As a kid, we all knew movies that were terrible, but most of these were very good. In some cases, you might not even know the film, but it was something that needed to be shown. The most famous example in that movie, in fact, is the movie The Devil Makes Love with Me.|0
From 2002 on Dutch cinema finally got better again. This movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of Dutch cinema.The story is needlessly told in flashback style. All of the 'present' sequences set in France are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. For some reason European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. I never understood why, or what the appeal of it is.The story self also isn't exactly the greatest. It isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell.|1
When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie. I was wrong. All though I am not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. This was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. The humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.I feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc.|1
Well it is a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's movies haven't been so great lately. On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for Isaac Florentine the director of Undisputed 2, i don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day Van Dame's movies hit the cinemas before the DVD.|1
Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces.|1
It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe.|1
"Of all the movies in the history of movies I can't imagine someone sitting down and saying, I want to spend X amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called ""Breeders."" Lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to Earth with something sinister lurking inside. Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of ""It Came from Outer Space"" instead? Why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds?"|1
"Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, was his first attempt ever bad!Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood film. It has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of ""Reefer Madness"" going insane for no reason.Sure, you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there."|1
A truly excellent look at the world and the realities of being a heroin addict . The movie is one that is going to change the way he looks at life. But it’s not about heroin, it’s only about heroin and not heroin. This is what happens when you take a deep breath and feel that you’re in the world you were in at the end of your first year in New York City and you start to feel a sense of peace and clarity. That’s when you realize that heroin can’t just be a habit.|0
If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.From the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen.Whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent Judi Dench) who have obviously never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read her, should be punished!|1
"...means ""take up and read"", which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article of the same name. The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle, clever, and make the film cinematically more dynamic. It's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.Watch out for this young director...he's going places."|1
"As Jennifer Denuccio used to say on Square Pegs, ""Gag me out the door."" I would definitely vote this movie on IMDB's Worst movie list.Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a guy from Chicago who goes to California peddling his brother's jazz records. He is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. But he acts more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). There are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure."|1
Ok , if you like yer monster moovies sullen , stiff , starchy , and thunderously dull , but with all the things you know how to play , you really won’t want to do that because it’s no fun to play for two days , but to do it you need to know everything about them . And if you can’t find all the things that you know to play well for you , it’s just not worth the effort and you can’t do it in your head.|0
"""Flashdance"" meets ""Meatballs III"" or maybe it should just be called ""Meatballs IV"". This is my friend Wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has a thing about J.V. cheerleaders. As someone once said: ""This is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out. Whether you want to or not, society demands it"". ""Gimme An F"" has cinema's greatest J.V. cheerleader Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a sweet-faced Alicia Silverstone from before her ""Clueless"" days."|1
It 's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but `` Caligula '' surely must hold this film and any other film that has it, so to speak, at all. When the director and the producer had their first shot together they had the best of both worlds, and both the director and the producer didn't know how to do it. So the director made their own movie and the producer did. The film is about a group of people who share a belief in evolution and religion and who have a lot of different beliefs.|0
I 'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie . Even my 4 and 6 year old ones were happy to see me! And that's a huge difference for me, I'm just a little bit embarrassed to admit it! I really hope it comes out in the next 5 or 6 years! Thank you! There's no point in saying that you should be happy about this. I'm glad that you're here! If you don't wish to be happy about it, just give yourself the benefit of the doubt.|0
The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and her henchmen. The Nun was originally created in the 1980s as part of a re-design of a nun's character, but has been created to replace her original image as a nun (with some minor modifications). It was not intended to depict a nun, but rather to show a woman who, if the nun's character is really a woman, could be more than a nun. The Nun is essentially the first nun created in film history.|0
Being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club ( this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans ) and I'm really happy with it. It's a fantastic movie which I will definitely go back to if I am ever in another area. The soundtrack is pretty well made and the visuals are nice but they are too small and do not capture the feeling. Anywho. I know that this is a pretty big project, but I was hoping I would get the chance to say it and that was not the case at all.|0
I was so excited to finally watch `` Pulse '' after receiving it from Amazon , and I have to say thank you for that! It really does make me smile and appreciate what I have been up to! It also gave me a lot of ideas and motivation to do it again, and to help others who want to learn how to do what I have been doing! I have to thank you a lot for what you have done!! It has made me so excited to finally get started again, and I am very thankful for that too.|0
hello , looking for a movie for the family to watch on a Friday night ? Ca n't find what you mean ? If anyone has any suggestions of what I could use in my application I would be happy to assist.I just have some questions for you, please contact me on any of my related topics below, I'll try to provide the answer for you.Thank you so very much!

"As a kid, this movie scared me green. As an adult, I couldn't stop laughing.I have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I caught it, instead, on a late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves. I figured, this HAD to be better. I was wrong.The movie has some very good elements; a water-divining mystic, a beatnik painter, couple of idiot ranch hands, an elderly history buff, and an ""evil wind."""|1
As a child I was never in a situation where I could be introduced to Dr Who and though I had heard of the series in passing, I never really realized exactly what it was. It was, then, with some hesitation that i sat down to watch the ninth Doctor and his antics having be told that he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) but cooler. I can't believe what I've been missing out on, seriously, why had no one told me about this before?|1
I would like to submit the following goof.During the bridge scene, soldiers are seen wading out in the river, asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags, packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally, if you look closely, you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water.|1
The makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief , you grant them it in the hope that given a small chance you'll get the hang of it. That's right, the suspension of disbelief is the only way out in the long term. It's up to you, you, the company, to make it happen. We know that's a long-winded story, however, but I'll be honest, I'd rather you tell it like you'd told me before. No one knows the full story, but we all know that there are ways to make your dream a reality.|0
I watched this because a friend told me it was damn good, and I watched a video on it, so I was really into watching it. I watched it, and, damn, the fighting scenes are REALLY good. If the guys can't fight like that in real life, they sure fooled me. There isn't as much fighting as I would like, I have to say, but the fights that are in the movie are pretty spectacular. They don't show much, but you can tell it's violent and cool.|1
At first I didn't think that the performance by Lauren Ambrose was anything but flaky, but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense. Amy Madigan seemed too terse for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together, even though it was apparent that her character was disengaged with the character played by Lauren Ambrose.Christopher Lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line. His character development left the audience wondering why he was chastised by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague story line was play by Taylor Roberts.|1
This is one of the best films I've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.Words won't do this masterpiece justice,suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain,humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it, although it's dressed as a film noir. Forget that feeble remake with Jolie and Banderas, see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.|1
Burt Kennedy both wrote & directed this western taken from a novel. Kennedy was a well known good writer & director, mostly westerns.Robert Mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this. This role was like many he had made already,One can see why he was a big star for so many years.He filled this role easily like a well used glove.The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father a fine actor Robert Walker--died tragically at age 32---his mother is noted actress Jennifer Jones).Robert was of slight build & even though he had talent only made a few films.|1
First off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular . The cast is like the saved by the director . There is no way to make the film as beautiful as they wanted. I am not saying they are talented or terrible but in this movie they are simply a good actor . They give so much and they work hard . Just as they would have worked with their actors . When it comes to the plot, I really don't think much about what they do and why they do it and what the characters do.|0
This is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. These people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. Anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. Toward the end, there's lots of action and a rape thrown in. Somebody must pay, and they do.|1
There were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but I still want to see them again. But I'm so going to get it now. I want to go see the ones I haven't seen in years. There were a lot of dumb teen getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but I still want to see them again. I want the ones I don't have seen back then. I just don't want to be scared of anything else.|0
This film is really really bad , it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at making this a good film. This was based upon a book I was given which was actually published about 25 years ago with my brother in law at that time , we were very close to one another . The first thing was to take a picture and look at the film, I did the first part but it would look like it was looking at the picture. Now I have another part where I think the problem was not with the lens but with the camera.|0
This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I would think you could get that from the title. Also, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film. I can't even remember why I saw this film or when. Only that is an absolutely horrible movie-viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then by all means rent it. Good luck finding it at your local store though. I doubt this movie is in a very wide-distribution.|1
"Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he made ""Bamako,"" but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been.The nominal ""plot"" involves a young African singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city. But far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as ""a mock trial against key financial institutions"" dealing ""with the overwhelming economic hardships of Africa."""|1
I 'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video ' and I was happy to put a review on the top of my blog. However, I do have the opinion that this is a good video, and that it is not being used in any way. I have been watching and I am happy to say this review. I will post it if I can make it. I am a bit of a perfectionist myself, being an avid gamer, but it is very good.|0
Susan Sarandon . She made this movie for me . I 've never appreciated her acting more than as I did . I love her character . And in my review . . . I liked her performance . I liked her voice . I had to see her character in the movie because I 'm a huge fan of her . When she's not acting in the movies, I think she 've always wanted her to be something she 'll never want . But I 'm not sure if she wants a part. The movie was pretty bad .|0
"FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team, in this early 'X-Files' episode that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first ""rockin'"" episodes. It pays loving homage to the much lauded John Carpenter 1982 theatrical feature ""The Thing"", and one can see the similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. Production design / art direction are especially impressive; the shots of the exterior of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers."|1
The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of Christ or something, I mean Halloween isn't that important is it? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows?|1
A comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies , The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach , Lambeau , who is hired in the first place by the team. He meets with a coach he’s not so sure of. In this episode we talk about the first day of the NBA draft, which was supposed to be held in the summer, but then ended up with a bad decision. We are told that Lambeau will not be a star in a few years, but rather in the first round.|0
I 've waited 9 years to watch this film , simply because i never saw it advertised on TV . . . . and it was great . . . . but i still think its time to go back. . . . i 've never seen any of that film or seen anything so i can't give you a full rundown . . . I never had time to see this, and its very entertaining to watch. And I 'll go back again if i'm in need of it, because the movies that have been reviewed are also great.|0
"Two actors play rival gangsters in three films , the final of which is a sci-fi film , that nods well to the work of the writer-director and director James Cameron . . . . The final film is the follow up to Cameron's earlier work and it's one that will not disappoint. But it's also something that Cameron could do if he was to make a sequel to Cameron's previous films. James Cameron

It's also something that Cameron may do for his next project , this one is a sci-fi film , the film is set in India . . ."|0
1. I've seen Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, speaks frequently with a high pitched voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor ! (see also much ado about nothing from Branagh - the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I've seen Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - but such lousy actors - all of them 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best!|1
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series , and had just watched parts 1-3 , which I thought was really pretty cool. So I went and watched parts 1 , 2 , and 2-4 which has one of the best puppeteers of all time! I really liked the first three of the series, I actually enjoyed both. I am so happy to have seen the other three puppet master series! It was a bit difficult to get all the episodes on DVD, so I ended up going to the Live TV and getting all of the episodes online.|0
This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going . The first scene shows a bunch of kids, a middle school and their family in a trailer park. As the kids run back to school, their parents and their friends are there for them to show to. As soon as they arrive, they have no idea how they are doing. They have no idea that what they’ve seen is a normal family life, and that they will be safe and well-fed for the next two years. It’s all there, but it gets real to me.|0
I haven't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent B Western. Or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie is one HUGE non-sequitur! It is an affront to the noble B Western films of the '30's. I have seen many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst.The bad guy is known as The Shadow - for crying out loud! Initially, The Shadow's scheme is holding up open-sided stage coaches.|1
"There is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. How ""Mostly Martha"" was remade is awful. The title of the movie is awful. The actors are awful. And the idea of combining good cooking and USA is awful. If you have seen ""Bella Martha"", well that is the original title and it means ""Beautiful Martha"", this one is a punch in the stomach. The acting of Ms.Jones is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better."|1
Let's get one thing straight: I like much of Snipes' work. Unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. This film, however, does little to enhance his reputation; it's not exactly unwatchable - but I am not in any hurry to watch it again either. In fact, if I never saw it again it wouldn't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on! It's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film.|1
"The Quick and the Undead is , finally , the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It’s one of the main reasons why the first movie was so awesome in the first place, but since then, many people have wondered if its the first. A quick recap:

1. It was really, really fun

The first movie has been a pretty disappointing one in a lot of ways, but there are a lot of great things to see and do, and there are definitely other great movies that can make this movie a better experience for everyone."|0
Personally, I have no problem with the acting, nor the script. I do have a problem with the giant bird. It was simply AWFUL. Plain and simple.One's first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it. What were they thinking!? Budget be damned. The monster bird was a monstrous joke.Of course, in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast. Oh well. What is done is done.|1
"Did people expect ""Jurassic Park 3"" to be full of surprises? Not one moment of it is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos! Tea Leoni...I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line. I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....Laura Dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with Sam Neil."|1
I was waiting for this movie for a time . In the first day of the air in Turkey , I got a surprise when one of my friends showed me this film . Today, I decided to share the film with my friend. And it's so amazing that we've seen many of the other movies of that name . In other words, this is the last film that I shared with our friends in Turkey . I want to say that the film is the best one I have seen in Turkey , because it's quite amazing .|0
I got this for my birthday in a box set under the name Broke Skull . Well , after watching the game I thought it was good to get this , because it wasn't that good and I thought it would get it in the way. I also think it might have been better to just cut the first one out of the box set and add it to the set after the other one . Oh, and also that I still have it for my birthday right now , since I had no idea it was going to have it in the way.|0
I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit.|1
First of all , the entire script is mostly improv , adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are looking at is an object and not a real part of the object. This is an idea that I’ve seen many many times with people and I don’t care at all about that. It’s not something you can find on the web and I think most people would like that. This video shows the concept. A lot of great stuff in there but at the same time I have an idea that I think would be cool, it would really make a lot of movies.|0
"A great performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider. I was high entertained and had much compassion for the character ""Alice"" played by Emily Grace. The story had me guessing in what would happen to Alice and was not predicable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters. The ending of the story ended on a rather fair way. I will purchase this DVD to add to my library."|1
`` Opposing Force [ 1986 ] '' was n't as good as `` Dr. Strangelove '' and it was n't as hard to imagine. To me it is hard for the reader to know what it is and how to identify it. So it may help to understand what it is like for you in the same way that the book can help you understand the meaning and impact of the author's story. The book should be read with care in mind and it should provide an explanation and reference for what you are seeing in the book in a way that would make you know what you are looking for.|0
The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it 's a load of hogwash ( the CPUSA was the most racist film). It is, and it will be, a load of hogwash because the film was completely shot, and not because of a bad movie in a bad movie, but because of the film, and even the movie, was shot with CGI. I'm not going to try to explain everything but it's a load of hogwash. And if you haven't watched it yet, here's the thing: The movie was shot with a CGI-like screen in the background.|0
As I said, sometimes low budget is good. You get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra BS that can hide an otherwise piece of crap. Well...this was that piece of crap. If anything, I thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. The only half-witted acting came from Bill Smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). There was never a Bill Smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. Even Gerald Okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies.|1
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I 've seen in a long time.It 's marketed as as Sci-Fi: Themed Science, but it was the first time I 've seen a real movie. There are many scenes in that movie, but the only one I knew I 'd like to see is one of the last scenes that I was supposed to film. This one's a great movie, and a good movie to watch in the middle of it all. I think I just got too tired to look any more ahead. You're watching this movie because it's a great movie about the paranormal.|0
There's a good story well hidden and never really used! The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, character and story development have been forgotten. What is left is muddled and superficial.Turn off your brain and watchyou will probably find that the time goes quickly enough, but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful, you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film.Watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.|1
As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch . Too unreal to be true . But, after I watched it I decided to get more than I need to get to know poker . So I bought this video to watch . You can see that I had been playing poker . I am not as good as some of you may think . I am a poker person . I have had to get used to playing poker for over a year . When I found myself playing poker with someone who is in a good place .|0
"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of ""Pre-Code"" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner IS!!"|1
I was shocked there were 18 pages of good reviews . This has to be one of the worst movies ever made by an Australian. There is absolutely no one out there that doesn’t want it, no one at all, that wants it. It can’t compete with a lot of great movie’s. So if you want to get into it, you need to read it, take a look and see what it is. I would think you will have a lot of fun in getting into this.|0
Not too many people seem to know about this movie. Which is too bad because I think it's pretty good. Sure it is a bit cheesy at times and may have a predictable storyline. But the presentation of the movie is pretty well done. I think the casting is good with likeable actors/characters. Tom Selleck does a good job at playing a baseball player (go figure... not too much of a stretch I suppose) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the chief (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There isn't too much to complain about.|1
The movie starts with a Spiderman spoof which is your introduction to Rick Riker ( played by Drake Bell of The Walking Dead) who has to deal with the effects of his father's spider, Bob. The comic features a series of flashbacks of the father and his son. The flashback takes place in an alternate reality for Rick and the film takes place over the same time. Riker was born as Rick Riker in 1980. He is shown to have been born and raised on a farm with his own father and a spider in his arms as he was raised.|0
My first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $ 5.00 . But since it featured a lot of stuff I didn't think the dvd was going for $ 5.00 . But he was able to pull it off and it went for a very little more than that. I hope I wasn't too stupid and that I didn't miss the fact that he'd already made the purchase and had no idea what he was going to have to pay out of my bank account if he was able to pay it back with it.|0
"""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.It's directed with a slick sense of style and avoids most action cliches. Geena Davis is great as an action chick and gets past her usual ""good wife"" role. Samuel L. Jackson is good as usual as the supporting player."|1
Ah! When good actors take on bland material! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed. While the situations are very true to life, the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. Much of the dialog is just plain silly.But! If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, then you will LOVE this movie!|1
This movie was alright . Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters ( sorry for stating the obvious ) who against each other . The movie was alright . Anna and Kate play twins ( also the twins who play her ) but as they have a sister, they do not . I have watched the movie but it is not even good . They play the two sisters while Kate is playing her and Anna plays her and it was alright . When they get married, Kate plays her twin sister Anna but she doesn't get her. Then they play her but it was alright .|0
"David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing. ""eXistenZ"" is classic Cronenberg. Briefly, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. The game plugs directly into a 'bio port' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell reality from game."|1
I love these awful 80 's summer camp movies . The best part about `` Party Camp '' is the line-up, where people get to sing and party, and then have to be there. It takes a couple of tries, but finally they get the job done, they don't have to make a huge crowd, and when they don't you get the crowd out of it, they'll have a party to go out on. They can have a long party to go out on, and if you think that's boring, or boring enough, you can do it.|0
This film has it 's heart in the right place , but unfortunately , it is n't much of a movie , its a great film that will get the attention of people who have never watched a television movie before ! . , but the fact is , the film is n't as good a movie as it would be , i would say, , but it is not what i would call an action/drama movie ! . . . ! , that just shows that there are many ways for a film to get people's interest, so there must be some way to get them interested !|0
Story of a strange love and a fall desire . Poem about beauty and his perfection , fear and touch.A portrait of an old friend, and a portrait of a love of the old.A story about how, when he grew up , he met his old friend . A portrait of a love of his grandmother , and of a love of the grandmother. What does this poem tell us of? This book is about a couple of lovers, and their love story . Poem about love , fear . Love , fear and touch , loss and acceptance . I am glad I have this book .|0
Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again . From the first image, he’s really happy that he did it. Now he’s happy with it. But I’ll admit he was a little bit surprised at the release of his latest book. That’s not a good thing. Not really. There are a lot of flaws in this story, but they’re the ones I would put off the most. I’ve not read it for some time, but it’ll take a lot longer to work through.|0
This movie, which I just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends living in New York searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at Coney Island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel, rather than on their homeless friend Richie. Cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of Coney Island.|1
"This self-important , confusing b+w `` film '' watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip . You would be surprised at what you could see if you look at it again :-/  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw1-cw3_Dm#t=10s

Now, you might wonder what this means to a movie and what you want the viewer to see if they like the sound. It seems like there are plenty of such things in this video that show how the music can affect your mind and you want to make sure to give it a listen."|0
Although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. I was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. These actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. The story involves an Italian Australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat. Supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs.|1
The plot - in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Y-chromosome-targeting virus, a (hot) female genetic engineer 'creates' a man in a chem lab - is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising premise, the movie falls flat in nearly every regard. The dialogue is laughable. The characters are paper thin. The exploration of a single-gender world is shallow. The worst part of the entire movie is the Asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that you'll want to vomit.I can't imagine how on earth this trash got produced.|1
I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. She played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. The movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of Jerry O' Connell's friends gets married. The other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. Anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. I'm glad I only paid .50 for this movie.|1
Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. This is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. Torture in and of itself is gruesome. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. But obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough.|1
Naturally Sadie sucks big time , I have no idea what the people were thinking about when they wrote this , it looks like there are 2 of you , I can understand that you have other plans for him but the reason is he has never been in the movies and never done one with you again. I have never seen another girl with him in my life . Saddie looks a little different than your picture of her on your screen. She had a great movie. I like the fact that she was in the movies. She was in the movie when she was a little girl.|0
This movie is a very enjoyable homage to the Bogart and other detective films of old . Robert Sacchi nails the film in every way. He’s got a great storyline, and one of the reasons that it is great is that he does so much good work in it. You can find his films here in the U.K., on DVD. You can see some of him in the U.S.A. This movie is a great introduction to the action-comic of the genre, and it is also quite good, especially for the younger audience.|0
Anyone that is looking for an episode of `` Law and Order '' or `` CSI '' would have to be one of the first to go. I don't know if that is necessary in the future but it is a great place to have an interview. Just one thing to look for when looking for episode of the show is if there are new episodes that have already been done in the show that can be used to find out more information about the shows that have appeared. One thing that is also helpful is to look at the show to see what is being said about it.|0
"There was no need for this movie, plain and simple. The original, although hated by some, was something I found to be actually really entertaining, mainly because it was before Jim Carrey started to really lose his touch, and Cameron Diaz was, well, ""Smoooooookin!"" 'Nuff said. So why make a sequel/prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. But then they just make mistake after mistake. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this man still allowed to breathe?"|1
"I just finished up this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Lurking Fear"" that was shot in Louisiana. Outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own ""twist"" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. Either way, it is a much better adaptation than Full Moon's THE LURKING FEAR. Too bad it is a terrible film. Director David McCormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short."|1
I have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now, but having just sat through the film I felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children. Please don't! This is no Disney film. This film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. The video box describes the film as a 'delight for all ages' and the IMDb plot outline describes it as a 'family film'.|1
The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre : setting it in the Old West and trying to capture the idea that the genre has become a part of the culture. This film has since been turned into a reality TV series and will probably have a bigger deal of its own. The first episode was released in the United States on July 1, and it's a pretty good one, too. The trailer shows the film being built on a concept set in the Western world of zombies.|0
Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America , and a reputation for making movies both popular and profitable, so his movie-making efforts have been going very well. In fact, he's been one of the biggest stars of the early 80s, as well as being considered one of America's best actors at the time. In the end, Nolan didn't think that his career was even in the early days, when he had nothing to do when making movies — which is what it really is. But that wasn't his fault.|0
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980 , starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor , Avery Schreiber as Captain Arthur Rolston , and Robert Denton in the role of Corporal Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . The movie received a strong response, and it is a very well received movie , and is well received by fans. But the movie does a bad job, and in some cases is not well received by anyone. If this picture is indeed good, then you might think that if the movie was bad, then you wouldn't have the right to complain at all.|0
The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch.|1
"Like the above poster, I got burned on the title thinking I was getting the other Piranha... This movie is everything the above poster said and worse... Poor camera, lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline...There was very little here that was even worth watching... How this movie even got released is beyond me. Make sure the movie you buy is the one you want... and not this one.The movie I bought was labeled ""Piranha"" and not ""Piranha, Piranha!"" which is what it actually is... This is the only way they sold this movie at all.Peace Out."|1
"One of the reviewers here wrote: ""Good acting, good special effects, greatlocation. Even better ending. "" All I can say is, ""Ugh."" This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian- considered extremely conservative by many people I know. So, what I am about to say is not biased by the""Christian content"" of the film. I'm not gonna bash it because it's Christian. I am gonna give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie."|1
So one day I was in the video store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a film I hadn't seen or even heard of.Now I like slasher movies in general, but this is just abysmal, not even good for laughs. Besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever come across. Now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had, but not here. Painful example of home-made horror.|1
"OK....so, by minute 15 in the film, there's still no dialogue.This film arrived to me in a padded sack from Down Under, with Sharpie encrypted info on the front. I am a programmer from a North American fest, and MOD LOVE was sent thru to me by our chief as a potential starter having preem'd at the far-away Moscow/Karlovy Vary interface.Straight away I thought ""this film is not for us"" (no dialogue by minute 15??) but kept watching anyway. Well, well, well."|1
"In terms of historical accuracy, this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea...Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats, taking the side of ""the people"" against ""the nobles."" This is patently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war."|1
"Perhaps I missed something, but I found GOYA'S GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama. As to the story it was trying to tell, I found that a confusing mish-mash that went off in all directions. And perhaps it should have been made by a Spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented English. I can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar ""artist's model's tragic fate"" plot line as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING."|1
I was just lucky I found this movie . I 've been taking advantage of Walmart 's $ 5.50 DVDs . I was just lucky that I found it . I am going to buy one . It has been released to the world . I am currently working on a film for a movie house. The only thing to do . Oh, and I've been watching a documentary about a young girl . I know . I saw a clip here . I thought . . . . but . . then I realized it is not really a film . I've seen it once before .|0
"After some quite OK Dutch action flicks , like Lek and Van God Los , Gerrard Verhage wants to make it seem as though the rest of his team were in the end-game. In reality the Dutch will not be winning any more than they would have at the start of 2010-11, as they still had a couple of games in the top six and an eighth. ""We can see that at the end of the last week,"" he added. ""We will look for some improvement and see where we are."|0
"This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn't a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. The focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome.Any movie that preaches about the ""one true god"" gives a short shift to freedom of religion. The movies ignore the fact that ancient Judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism."|1
Even if you do not typically enjoy documentaries , odds are you will find this one fascinating . Not only that you are not going to have to deal with these things, you do not have to be a bad person to enjoy these films . . . If you watch these videos , it will be really interesting to see where they are going. Not only did they give you some great content to watch , but they also provided some awesome ideas to help you understand some of the details of these great documentaries . . .|0
I hate to admit it , but they were right to sack Schrader . The opportunity is here to build a massive, massive, massive network to provide the resources needed to do what they said they were doing, and in this sense, “the good” is also the great one, in the sense that I believe it is the great one, and is the only one of whom I can count. We need the resources that we got. There is another way. The second way is to make it very hard for them to succeed in their role.|0
I remember this bomb coming out in the early 80 's . At first it sounded like a great idea . It went off right away because there was no one there to listen to it , but eventually they realized it wasn't that much of a bomb . It was actually going to have to be removed . In that moment they figured that they could come back, and they did. They got a phone call that night and were told they'd heard the bomb coming . At that point, they knew they could just get home and return the bomb. They did.|0
"the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic, as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects, such as paedophilia. the newsdesk set, the suits, the smug presenters, the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them, the pointless cgi graphs and stats, the whole thing was a satire, a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career (""there is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact"")."|1
"As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors who, well... are not really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music to compliment the rap and of course, a hot looking crazy chick in leather with no hips, and we prevent ourselves from being half past budget. Why, oh why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films?FBI capture two buddies and send them to ""New Alcatraz,"" where the prison's first inmate to be executed has unexpected guests.First rate acting all around, particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys."|1
This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen . When I watched the manga review in 2004 I thought it was the same, with the characters still wearing the same costumes, but the characters are a bit different . . . not like the anime. They all look the same . . . and they all have a lot of commonalities! . . . they all have the same sex. I didn't have to read it, but I think it is very interesting. The first chapter of the anime is really interesting but it doesn't have many of the characters that I knew.|0
"My friends and I have watched this so many time I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. ""Greg, stop clowning! "", scolds Dr. Brandon."|1
"This movie is so bad, they wouldn't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece ""Deadfall"". The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld, and those other two movies redefined rank, so what does that say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store, that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't buy back Underworld either."|1
I have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it , despite the lack of interest. I do not regret this film because it is not based on the film. I was surprised at how little money I have lost in the last 5 years or so. I will always want to be in the art. I’ve spent a great deal of time working on the original film which was shot on location in the mountains of Arizona. The only problem is that I have never really seen it myself.|0
I like The Wind and the Lion very much. It was a good movie. I thought that since I'm young and it was made so long ago I wouldn't like it all that good, but after I saw it, i was amazed of how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it to liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco was treated during the Early 1900's, by the Germans, French, and even the Americans.|1
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worthwhile. This is the second Bruce Willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity, off-color humor, profanity, or gratuitous violence. (I refer of course to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies are engaging on more than one level. This one is appropriate for children as well, although as others have pointed out, it isn't a flick FOR kids.|1
While many pass this off as a B movie it is , indeed , a first class comedy that is the real story of this man. He is quite a man, and the story he is going to tell will be very good. If you look closely at the script, you will see that it is a comedy movie and it has some funny moments and moments that will bring out in your mind the funny parts of it, and you will wonder how he gets all the laughs in this movie. For this reason I recommend you take a few minutes to check the review of this comedy.|0
So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.From the very beginning of this film, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets 'Rita Repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field!|1
Not the best of the WIP 's , but not the worst either . I honestly feel guilty laughing at that . I feel the whole world was made for it , and I do believe it , as it is not that bad . We can only hope we're not made for it again , and we don't have time to look back at all of it . We've got time for this . So I'm just going to make sure we do this , because if we do it again , I think that will mean a lot of change .|0
I rented this film out of the local video store one day , you know , the kind of movie that I know that I like but I really wanted to see it. I really love it. The first thing that we did was look at the trailer of the trailer of the film and see what was happening there. I love it so much that I love it also because I think that the film is also one of the best films of them all. It has been my favorite movie so far, so far, for so many years.|0
"After being off the air for a while, Columbo returned with some new made-for-TV mysteries that, while not being as good as the original series, are better than the shows that were done in the later '90s. ""Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health"" used the then (and I guess now, if you think about it) true crime shows as the situation for a murder. The murder is committed by a very successful, egomaniacal true crime show host, George Hamilton (in a nice bit of casting)."|1
The film deals with universal themes , mentioning no specific country as its context : it could happen anywhere -- even the United States -- but not in a way where people have a sense of identity that is shared by others. This is the story of one individual who is an American. This individual was identified by the film as a foreigner (or some other non-American) but was not named or shown as the person he was looking for, either on the plane or in a hotel room. But, while he was there, he had no way of knowing why he was there.|0
"There are no saving graces in this dreadful , stagey , boring snooze-fest , which brings to mind `` The Darkest Hour "". This is what I'm going to say when I look up in the dictionary today. In fact, it was a little more than a few weeks ago I found a great article called `` ""What's Up with the Night?"". When I got home, I told my wife and me what was going on. She had been to the party, and she said something, and she said that we were on our way to bed."|0
"The Bone Snatcher is about a group miners who go on a search for a missing crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When the find them, they are nothing more than bones stripped clean and they could not have been dead for more than six hours. The story keeps you interested as to what exactly caused this. The characters are well enough, and the acting is pretty good.About an hour and ten minutes in when you find out what is causing the bones to be stripped clean, you sigh ""oh, that is really stupid."""|1
You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before ALICE FAYE's popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed. It fared modestly OK at the box-office.Faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in New York City--and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start. Instead, it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete song number by Faye) was never filmed.|1
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old . I remember loving it for months before seeing it. When I was six, I was so scared for the next two years and I couldn’t believe what I saw. Then I got scared again and it became a little scary. I don’t understand why this movie didn’t make the cut. Maybe because I was just afraid of getting scared again . I don’t know. Maybe I’ll never make it to the end of my life .|0
I was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the Far Cry game had been created . It looks to me like this is a bit of a misnomer so I don't know. It's really not. I'd be surprised if it was. I'd say this is probably one of the most beautiful games you'll ever see or hear about. The story is actually pretty good and the voice cast is pretty good. I don't know that I'll be playing this in the movies. But I expect it's gonna be pretty much the same in the movies.|0
"The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) titled ""Our Family Trouble."" To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line."|1
"I am partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say ""partly"" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. Sadly this film falls into the later category.This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki's recent film ""Howl's Moving Castle"". An intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.The first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold."|1
"I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going. But when I saw the beginning credits, I said ""oh my god, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek). Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers, and he's almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan who used to star on my favorite Soap, All My Childen. Put on a few pounds but he can still act. Then there was Veronica Hamill. too bad I didn't sick around to see her in the film. I bailed out 20 minutes into he film."|1
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London, I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This movie has great shots, an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known' London.The movie is held completely in 'dark' colours, which I personally don't like too much. Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat. Other than that, there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots.|1
"While not as bad as some movies (like the horrible ""Atomic Twister""), ""Meltdown"" still relies upon common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in the pursuit of a Masters Degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry.Riding the false fear that a Chernobyl style meltdown could happen in an American plant, the movie states that any meltdown (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the movie) would mean disaster for the area."|1
I loved it . In fact , I watched it over and over and over , and I could watch it again. There are times when I need to go to an airport and see if it will be on my radar. The fact is that for the next 6 months , I’m only going to watch the movies I’ve watched for a month and a half ! But I know that there is much more to watch. And I want to watch more movies. And I know that you know this, too . I want to watch a movie and go to it again!|0
Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through!|1
Are you kidding me? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the dialog. And the music was nothing great. Anyone know what Jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. Anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. I felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. And what does a Kansas teen know about shopping in Soho....couldn't we have had a better line here?|1
If you thought NBC 's 10.5 was stupid , you 'll be happy to hear that FX reached into the airwaves for all you're worth by taking out the money, and that the deal was broke . The deal was supposed to be good for NBC and CBS, so they did their best . But now NBC 's 10.5 won the game . And it's all about Fox TV . And they 're on the right side of things . You 'll be surprised by the fact that Fox has made so many of its big money .|0
Great 1980s Comic Strip comedy set in the South West of England . It is a tale of sex , violence , murder , friendship, relationships and a sense of mystery . The comic strip is one of a number of successful comedy projects that feature characters from other genres. The show follows the adventures of a couple in the South West of England . They have lived for a decade and are engaged to one another in their own world . The main plot revolves around the couple who live in London and are determined to become their lovers.|0
Some critics have compared Chop Shop with the theatrical releases of City of God and Pixote. I've seen both of those as well as Chop Shop and like in many instances, I don't feel the comparison is warranted. City of God and Pixote surely had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is a low budget independent film about survival and hope, disappointment, and continuing with life. One of the scenes is allegedly filmed during the US Open and either the filmmakers had incredible connections or the scene was filmed at another time and the US open footage was added.|1
I feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film . It is apparent that there are many of these things that are out of print or out of order and that is because of these people not understanding these things. If it were up and running in the last month , this could well become a problem. This is my second review for this movie and I have not done it before - I think this is something to do with the fact that I was reading the previous review for the movie.|0
"Childish storyline ripped off of a lame Hollywood movie, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and not quite ""up-to-par"" sex scenes. That's right another great softcore parody! I enjoyed this film greatly! Sure the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! The storyline is ludicrous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl-on-girl sex scenes. And because it's only softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a little bland. But it's like the great god of softcore smut Russ Meyers said ""who really cares what goes down beneath the waist."""|1
I rented this type of `` soft core '' before , but I can honestly say , I was n't able to get to them after. I'm really looking forward for some more experiences as I feel I could have some fun with it as it's not what I thought I would be able to get, so I'm more looking forward to learning more and more of this kind of thing, which I will be sure to have in my next release. And now that you're all getting to know what that looks like, you can try to make it work for you!|0
This movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story.Oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.Does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock.|1
Okay ... for the most part , and all its cheesiness , this movie was actually pretty good for an episode. But it also was interesting for the most part. The characters were pretty interesting , and the ending was also interesting for me as well. As always, if you don't know all the characters or just want to watch the story you should watch this one, and if you want more than that you don't think you should watch it , but if you just want to give it a shot , this is one of my favorites and I hope it has some good stuff to share .|0
"The plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only ""star power"" if we can call it that consists of Joe Estevez. I don't know what is more shocking. The fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you ever see the cover of the video you'll be able to read them. Someone even went as far as saying that the actress/writer could be the leading lady of the 90's. Yeah! And Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin."|1
Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's, others don't quite make it. Examples like His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind, and I would also The Floorwalker in this category.Charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). This manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and Charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects, stolen by other costumers.There aren't many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator.|1
"This film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. After a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip.We are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates, including one tart who is always half dressed. During this stage the film heightens tension with strange ""plinky plinky"" background noises that had me on the edge of my seat.I stopped paying attention for a while but when I looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing."|1
"This was such a great film. It was done with such beautiful design, such symmetry. I love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth, space and beyond. It was such a fluent, and thought provoking masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of ""Do you need me/us now""? The movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a mere movie?"|1
Although this was the first Hunter S. Thompson documentary I have seen it was average at best despite the involvement of its cast members. I will not be repeating the story of Thompson from the 1980s, though in that story, he made no mention of the character of a Hunter. I will be checking this again after watching the release of the first Hunter S. Thompson. There was much dialogue between the actors and the director about the character and how it fits with the plot. There were very good scenes with both Thompson and Thompson as the protagonists.|0
This is , arguably , the worst of the major Ava Gardner films . Yes , she is gorgeous . But , what if she was more than a teenager . . . The best thing about her is that she has the best of the two films she was most famous for so far but even she wasn’t able to fit in with many of her fans . . . It was hard to choose which one she would be . . . I would argue that she is probably a bit over-produced . But that’s because her first appearance as an actress was a long time ago .|0
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff ( splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne ) was at the centre of an all out attack in the 1980’s. That was a moment he had never forgotten. Radzoff, a young British singer/songwriter who has been on tour in the UK for more than twenty years, was an obvious choice to represent a new era in American cinema, where the world could have easily had a much different sound. Radzoff was the most influential artist and performer to have won two Grammy Awards in 1989 and 1994 for his sound.|0
For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to `` Rosemarys Baby '' is one big winner, in the way that a lot of kids have won. In this case, the cast and crew had a very good time getting to grips with the concept of this movie. But it wasn't much of a hit with fans and audiences, either, but it's good to know that Rosemarys Baby is the most anticipated of all films. Of course, I couldn't say that I thought it was a great movie, even though I wasn't a big fan of it myself.|0
I saw this movie last night on HBO & did n't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep on the couch reading a bunch of movies in a single night - I don't remember the ending - but that was a movie I have watched in the past 5 years - I haven't slept much for the last couple days. What I find most interesting is the fact that the movie I watched was pretty entertaining. I liked the movie. I enjoyed it! I will admit that the movie was less enjoyable than the movie, but I think it was the movie's ending.|0
This was a excellent movie . I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching the film and it made me feel very proud. I am a very sensitive child in a difficult situation. But I am so afraid about it. I have just read this article about a woman that had been killed and I think I need to find out why. She was killed with the intention of ending her life and it is very sad but I think that's the reason. I am a young mother of two grown children.|0
An on screen caption informs us that it is 'the Caribbean Sea, May 1891'. A small lifeboat drifts aimlessly at sea containing six convicts from a shipwrecked prison ship, and the ship's Doctor a Lt. Claude De Ross (Claudio Cassinelli). It's night, a strange current takes the boat towards a strange, unnamed and uncharted island. The boat hits some rocks and is torn apart. One of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish-man creature. The next morning morning Claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach.|1
`` Chupacabra Terror '' is saved from a ' 1 '' by the presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as a character on the main game''. Chupacabra Terror '' was originally played as a 2-person action-villain, in which a young girl is abducted to kill her parents as they were trying to get to her. She then dies after being lured into a high-rise apartment with four men to try to kill her. After the kidnapping of the girls, she was found and kidnapped. She is the only real character to be played '' on the Main Series '' with a '1''.|0
I attended a screening of this movie. It was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups. I think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast. I'm amazed this movie cost $3-$4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? It obviously didn't go to writers for re-writes. Nice thought to bank on the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but a major miss. There was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best.|1
"The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman . She gave her rather thankless performance, as well as a very good performance as well. Though it was a slow performance, I was very impressed with the performances performed. If you’re lucky, you would have liked to hear Natalie. No comments yet:

But during his investigation Robicheaux is led into a series of surreal encounters with a troop of Confederate soldiers? ?, What a awful plot and it was worser than i had expected. it was real slow and had minimal skill in the acting i could not watch through it it was waste of my time. Another FLOP, i would give it under 1 if i could please people don't waste your time its 1:42m of wast-full time. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend driving under the influence.|1
I have watched every version of this play that I can think of, including several on the stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I have ever seen! He has the most wonderful voice for stage acting, and his expressive face will take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this play. The way in which he delivers his lines takes you on a journey through madness. He (as Hamlet)can in an instant be loving, soft and gentle and in another instant be raging against the hell that is his life.|1
Jeff Leroy wanted to makes fun of Scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it . And, I’m pretty sure there were plenty of people on the left who hated Scientology as a cult. (Well, they’ve got the right one, so I’ll keep it under wraps.) For the rest of this weekend, I want to talk about a couple things that have changed on Scientology. First, I’ll tell you what you’ll find on the website.|0
Sweet, rich valley girl develops crush on a punk from the alley and when her snobby friends disapprove of him, she's forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very funny romantic comedy blends in elements of black comedy and '80's cheese that make this all the more fun to watch. The movie not only follows the life of the valley girl and her punk; but her friends too as they shop, party, hang out, and go to the mall. If the dialogue doesn't have you laughing non-stop for a week, the music will.|1
A chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room Italian castle while still grieving the loss of her parents. They’ve been divorced for years, but their only child is finally born. As they’ve moved back to the Netherlands, she’s moved back to the country to raise her second child. “This is my first time getting out of the big house together. My family is really close to the ground. I’ve never met a single person in the world who has been in the house with me for so much time.|0
I viewed my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances just as gripping as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course,was the master of the role of Sweeney; there is never a touch of softness in his determination to wreak vengeance on those he believes caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex portrayal, as Mrs. Lovett.|1
Amazing , amazing , amazing . What more can be said ? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the screen. He was so good, that is if he was ever going to get over the hump. I am a fan, of course. If he had the chance, he would have been at the highest end of the table. He had to come back, but he came back, but he got out of his own way and he didn’t have a lot of control in the beginning. He is the best Hamlet ever; he can do everything, he can make everything right.|0
`` Black Vengeance '' is an alternate title for `` Ying hung ho hon '' AKA `` Tragic Hero '' and the other characters were released for a limited time. If the game is to have been made up of more playable characters, it means the original game was released for an extended period of time, with the game becoming very old and out of date. There are also a ton of other characters as well. There are a few extra items included in `` Black Vengeance '' that can be purchased by the player as a supplement to the original story.|0
The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I've yet run across. You would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie. Acting  Bad. Editing  Bad. Direction  Bad. Special Effects  Bad and Laughable. Plot  Bad. Lighting  Bad. Cinematography  Bad. Costume Design  Bad and Silly. Everything Else  Bad. Watching The Adventures of Hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real endurance test.|1
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, Billie, who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy.|1
"We are in a small town, a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.Beware, My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli's {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called ""The Man"". Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness."|1
The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate. The main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters?|1
This movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on TV for free, and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Other than that, Hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in Mississippi. To go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. It wasn't. I remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing.|1
"The plot for Black Mama White Mama , revolves around two female inmates , at a women 's prison in New Jersey, and their daughter , which has a lot of problems. It has two very different lives, one in the real world, but it is also in a real life place. One of the problems is that everyone who lives in prison is a black man and a black woman. But, there are also other problems, like:

  1. When the inmate goes missing, he should be held at gunpoint."|0
Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey (producing and starring) and Brian Grazer have worked on together, but bits of it are definitely worth a look for laughs. Basically Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. That's until the company of Dynocorpe sinks and closes down. Now Dick and his wife Jane (Téa Leoni), and their son of course, are in trouble with money. No matter what they try, they can't raise the kind of money they really want.|1
The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He's a young gun who with partner David Carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a Mexican general. In eluding their pursuers Carradine and Walker become separated. Walker comes upon the camp of lawman Robert Mitchum who takes a liking to Walker and makes him a protégé and reclamation project of sorts.This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum did with writer/director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. Not that Young Billy Young does not have its moments of hilarity.|1
Another movie that makes the story of The Beach Boys worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he's to quit touring and the other Boys calls him traitor. I didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. A movie about The Beach Boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group.|1
"For a series that was inspired by Kolchak , it 's ironic that The X Files first attempt at a parody of the classic YA parody from the 1960s, where one of the many characters is called a ""Yank"". For the most part, The X Files has done quite well in this regard. But it has also fallen far short of being an ideal parody of Yank, and so far as we know nothing has been able to tell us whether The X Files or one of the Yanks were created by one of them. However, there is no doubt about it."|0
This movie is funny if you 're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me ( repeating every five minutes ) and was on the phone with someone who I'd know if we had anything interesting. It was interesting because I was sitting on my own couch, and I'm not doing anything. It's funny to watch it in person. And it was interesting in the best way. When I first got this, the movie had been filmed in Florida and I had never been in the same place twice.|0
"Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match ( Mahler 's 5th is gorgeous , but listen to 's ""Dunkin'"" or Mahler's 2nd ""Amen"") - you have to be the only man alive who can find a place in an afterlife. You have the freedom to choose your fate, but you have to have the ability to be the man in which you choose to die. Amen is Mahler's title - you have to know how to choose that fate. Mahler's 5th sentence is the title of the movie you are watching."|0
This movie was probably one of the worst movies I 've seen in a very long time . A friend of mine who worked for a company was asked if he could make it better. When I got it done he said he loved the idea so I gave him $10 and he 'll be able to sell the rights. And that's it for this one... I had no idea that it would be such a fun movie but I'll say it because it's about two young guys at the moment, who are struggling to get back into their work and have problems with it.|0
"Mr. ""Uwe Fail"" strikes again, transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap. Poor acting; Poor Directing; Awful adaptation; I mean, Far-Cry game was awesome, its like a true FPS game, cool weapons and lots lots lots of ""point and shoot"". In the movie we had nothing compared to the game.. Well we had some of the ""point and shoot"" thing but... i don't know how to explain, but if you ever watched another ""Uwe Fail"" movie you will understand."|1
"Visconti 's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made . While watching , we noticed something strange on the screen . It's a guy wearing glasses. If you don't get it, then look around for something to wear. He has no idea what you are talking about. ""I am not talking about you,"" you say. ""You are a stranger."" He looks puzzled. ""No. No, no, no, no."" ""Oh,"" you say, ""I mean you."""|0
"After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to watch his ""Masterpiece"" (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI.Now i am a little bit disappointed about the story.So I have at least these five questions in my mind:1. In the final Countdown Louis Grutter shot from the inside a house the main Character Tony le Stéphanois. He couldn't know if he is still alive or not, but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house (with the money) to reach his car."|1
I generally LIKE Sion Sono 's work , but this movie was completely retarded . But sadly , not retarded , but is retarded and has some problems in the ending , i.e. in the film , but is retarded and the ending . The ending was bad for me and it was hard to see in it . This was because the story was made for the audience , not the characters . There were some other problems , but they weren’t big enough , the ending was good , and not retarded and has some problems in it . The movie has some problems .|0
I agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull . I found myself disliking the film . It made me mad because of the way it was directed . . I have never been disappointed with the cinematography . I liked it a lot better in the first half of the movie. It was just too dull and repetitive . I agree with some of the other commenters that films are boring and dull. I have never been disappointed with the film , but I really like the cinematography. I like that one . Yes, there were a lot of good lines and I think they were beautiful.|0
Seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies. Joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody. He takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death, who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from Tango & Cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb galloot who questions Led Zeppelin.|1
"Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this ""gem."" This one is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80's porn you could have purchased on VHS from an arcade on 42nd st. before Disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down. But, wait - all the sex scenes have been cut. I challenge anyone to find a worse film. This film could replace water-boarding as a humane method of interrogation. No, I take that back - I would prefer water-boarding."|1
I saw this version of Hamlet on television many years ago, and have seen every other version since, whether television or movie. However, this is the one that remains the truest depiction of the story for me. Most excellent Derek Jacobi made Hamlet *real* for me. Before I saw this version, Shakespeare was simply gibberish to me and I never tried to understand the Elizabethan English. Having seen Jacobi's Hamlet several times not only increased my knowledge of literature, but also that of my family. I promptly checked the play out of Library and read it, and poured over the accompanying recording.|1
"""Hood Rat"" is absolutely terrible. This is a urban version of ""Willard"". I just can't believe this movie got made, let alone distributed. Someone in Universal Studios thought that people would watch and like this ""movie"". The only good thing in this is Ice-T as the landlord. He was funny. The one thing I hate in movies is sped up action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the WHOLE movie is like that. Every scene transition is some fast motion special effect. The director should be banned from making movies forever."|1
Admittedly , the only reason I watched this film -- since it 's been about a decade since it was made -- that was that I'm not sure it was the best film I've seen in years (or that I didn't want to see it again) and I really didn't like it at all. (For me, this was the one I loved most). It was an incredible performance and one I still enjoy watching. In terms of how it looks, I'm really glad it's doing the right things for the right reasons.|0
i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this article are causing us to react, and what to do to make it safer. On the first day of school and all the ways you can play, you will have no problems playing. The girls play and it will feel good to them. The adults will not play, so what do you have to do to make it more safe, so it doesn’t feel too far from where you are. “There is a lot of stress here.|0
Got the chance to see this at a friend 's house today , and was impressed with what it achieved, and what we could do to make it possible for our son to learn the English language. He was a big fan of English , and he had always been in love with the sound of words and their rhythm . It took two days to learn the Spanish language , before he got the chance to meet the man he loved. In the meantime, with his English skills and enthusiasm he started a business with his son .|0
I 'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie : # 1 Angelina Jolie sex tape: 'I 'm sure you haven 't seen 'this movie! # 2 When Angelina Jolie gets to the end of the movie (and we'll get to a movie later in this book) she starts to masturbate, but then starts to run away from her lover. It seems like this movie will never end, and we don't think this is the way things are to end. We just hope that Angelina Jolie doesn 't end her scenes when it comes to the end of the show.|0
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown . I ca n't say it is good or bad . it is a pretty easy to read book . but it's not what you read. I read the first two pages of the paperback and the last book in the first book (the first to the right was the last) . It's nice to read what I like about the second book (the one to the left is interesting as well , but there are still some issues that I do not like so I don't have much to tell) .|0
As I write this in November 2005 I've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the British government not giving film makers tax breaks I think the cause is much simpler - A lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . Let's have a look at what the Brits were producing 1995-2005:Funky gangster thrillers . LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape Guy Ritchie's style with usually disappointing results Romantic comedies .|1
I just found out before writing this review that `` Komodo vs. Cobra '' and another movie called `` Curse of the Lost Souls '' are actually pretty good. I have seen both the classic and the spin-off films in the past year, but this movie made me like the spin-off. I was thinking that the classic would have been too hard on me to keep it in my head. It also seems that the spin-off film would be a little less interesting than the classic movie. This was not because the movie was good, but because the movie could have been better and more fun.|0
"Hey what do you expect form a very low budget movie!?!? Although I haven't seen ""Dahmer"" (2002) I can say that following what the media put out about Jeff this is a pretty accurate depiction. I have studied the Jeffrey Dahmer case and learned all I can about this man. This is a low budget movie but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can get past gore and see what the underlying story of a sick mind. I loved this movie! Just brace yourself for low budget and no blood."|1
This movie was fabulous . It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film . The directing and camera shots are really fantastic , the music and music score is also fantastic , the film was filmed at the location , the shoot was done at an airport and everything is done at a very early stage . I wanted to share with you what a top 5 hitchcock movie looks like and how it all worked out. I’ve been following this guy all these years, and now I want to share with you what this film looked like in the first half. 1.|0
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [ # 4/10 ] , with atmospheric almost noirish black and white cinematography in its first four episodes, this is an episode you may enjoy as well as any of the others and you may enjoy it a lot more. The first scene of the first season is very atmospheric, so this episode comes in handy for those with a keen eye on this series. There are only a few seconds between episodes and it’s still very much an episode that will get you going.|0
"Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller (as Tim) throws his sister's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) howls and smokes a cigarette, after killing Danyi Deats (as Jamie). The doll washes away, but the naked young woman stays by the ""River's Edge"", for any passerby to see. Viewing the dead body are a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked corpse. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (as Layne) are found most camera-worthy."|1
"After an astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to a military base. Inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on ""Columbo"". Executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one... particularly in the 1960s.This movie is cheesy and poorly constructed."|1
I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is awful viewing. On the contrary, I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We're introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse.|1
"A look at three geishas who are way past their prime . Now they look back on their pasts with interest . This is what I found in the book:

“The Geishas from the Middle East” The Geishas from the Middle East. A book about the geographies of Middle Eastern influence in this area. ”The Geishas of the Mediterranean Sea . This is what I found in the book:

”This book is about Geishas from The Middle East. ”This book describes what geishas looked like during the last three millennia. In fact, this book is more than just descriptions."|0
The storyline of this movie is cliché and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. It seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. It's funny though, because it's so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. No one seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand).|1
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre. Vulnerable, naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered, despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her. The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style, as well as a cast of wacky characters. The pleasures of this film don't come from the film's shocks, which are fairly tame, but from the weird atmosphere.|1
"Imagine you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a kid. Now think what would happen if you had the chance to speak with your younger self, or even change him/you. Would you try to influence or try to change your younger self's beliefs in light of your future experience? Or perhaps the encounter would change your older self's perception of life and reality? Walt Disney's The Kid tries to engage this complex thought by putting ""older self"" Bruce Willis in a collision course with ""younger self"" Spenser Breslin (from The Santa Clause 2 and The Cat in the Hat ""fame"")."|1
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four, odd story about love or career. I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended. Also the unique pause in the middle is something I've never seen before.Can't wait for the series (if they're doing one) or the extended DVD.|1
Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck. Just from the title, it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously... it's as tongue in cheek as a nympho's french kiss, and just as titillating. The female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Check this out, Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks, this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses.|1
The first few minutes of this movie do n't do it justice ! For me , its not funny until its over. It just goes with the flow ! But I think I will watch it again in a few months. My boyfriends and I just went to see this movie and its not funny. I'm looking at all the pictures. I never saw it before and I didn't think to look it up. But its not funny to look at , and it looks nice to see. I think its a good movie and I wish it was so. 1.|0
This story starts at the end ! So the film 's opening credits advise us . Unfortunately that 's not the time , so let's get to the real deal. When we've finished the film we should probably get into it and get into some of the other films that have just been released , which will probably be the first thing to come out soon. In the movie 's opening credits we should probably find out which films were released and why and we should get into more and more detail about each of them.|0
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made. Huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated Spanish middle class. There must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider. This can be pretty annoying.Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound, the movie alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the Surrealists in general, a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to Duchamp's ready mades. What's more, the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of Julio Iglesias.|1
I have always liked the Carry On films, with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy, but I can see why the critics give this one two stars. Basically, many British people are gathering on a coach to go on a Spanish holiday to an island called Elsbels to the Palace Hotel. What they didn't know is that it is not completely built, plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours, they have crap draws, and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, putting on quite an amusing accent, e.g.|1
The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960 's Broadway musical that became famous because of the cast. This was followed with the 1985 film adaptation, which was written by Jerry Haines and starring John Hurt. It also starred Tony Kushner, and is based on the film. The movie is set in the 1980s but the characters are drawn from a larger-scale film based on the novel of the same name. The film's cast are led by a man with a different background, as well as by actors Anthony Rapp, Robert Redgrave, and Ben Mendelsohn.|0
A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a 'hairy ' adventure through an uncharted cave.' That is, do they exist, and if so, what they do? In a world without a dark past, does anyone know where a man or woman is, or even where the soul is? If there's a man and a woman alive, what will happen to the soul if they are dead? What will happen to them if they are dead, or if those who are alive do not die, or if anyone survives and is able to walk again.|0
Visconti's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endlessly opulent Death in Venice surely is; but in other important ways, it's an unsatisfying film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and output; of his imperious manner, his layer-upon-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and obsession arises, it's evident that Aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his Gilded-Age trappings and carefully lived life.|1
I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible . I knew some of he facts about Caravagggio , but here it is . It sounds as if . I really do wish I had gotten the idea to watch him in the movie but I also found it totally incomprehensible. I am not going to waste any more time reading this because it has all of the following facts . . The film doesn’t just make sense . I really wish there were more people watching . I want to see Caravaggio better . . I also wish there was more to watch .|0
"In 1895 , in a small village in Japan , the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo ( Takahiro Tamura ), who became a kagomai in his own words, took a bath and put her hands in the water and let the water drip down her body. She cried out in pain and felt herself drowning. The husband also drowned in a lake while in his bath. She said, ""I found that I was so sad that I wanted to help my husband who was in such pain."" Later, she gave the wife a bath."|0
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge. Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now (how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery). He hooks up with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, around 25 and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. Also in the cast are an embarrassed-looking Anjelica Huston in some hilarious sci-fi get-ups and a pudgy, short-ish Ron Perlman (whom I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles!).|1
28 years before 9/11, there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history.|1
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise), and the best soundtrack I've probably ever heard...if that all make sense.The first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride. (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there, the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy.They're lonely, mess-up, and boy do they talk about sex.|1
many people said this was a great movie with Hoffman delivering a great performance. i went from suspended disbelief, to fidgety boredom, to almost walking out. there is no there there.Hoffman does go all out. he is committed to the performance. but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery.no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, the sheriff are all one-dimensional.yes the film shows the manipulative, preening, dishonest sides of capote.|1
"Screen treatment of the comedic Broadway success ""The Gay Divorce"" (a title which was considered too scandalous for American moviegoers, though it was used in the U.K.) concerns a man and woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. Betty Grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number ""Let's K-nock K-nees"" with overtly sissified Edward Everett Horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout."|1
I do n't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie , i mean really . You got to understand a little about the story, if you read it youll see how it was put together. That is all for now. If you are curious, you will want to read up more on the other characters in this video. Also i wanted to share some photos i made of a scene from the movie. This was taken with a Canon EF-1E, Nikon D6D and the camera is equipped with a 17-mm f/1.8-1.2 (2.2) lens.|0
"I just called my brother Paulie on the phone and he said he was watching Hoods and it was funny. So, like I said, never go against the family! The demand for more lines is OK since I like to express my own opinions quite frequently. If something is misspelled it's most likely my eyesight and not my brain. This gives me yet another chance to take my shots at ""The Departed"". When one knows exactly what is going to happen in the last scene with no prior knowledge, that usually means it wasn't all that suspenseful."|1
Because Mr. Bean almost never speaks , I heartily recommend using a DVD player with the teacher holding his finger in his thumb and thumb. It is one of the most effective means of teaching a subject without the need for any kind of computer skills. I use a Mac for teaching a subject without a computer and I don't like to run into any difficulties when using these methods with computers. The DVD player is worth a look, though, and I highly recommend it as it gives me the opportunity to train and master more than just a computer.|0
"I just recently stumbled upon this show when ABC family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered. I remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007, and thought it would be short lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family.Never doubt an ABC family show! This show surprised me in the best way possible. Not only is the show well written, story lines are realistic, funny, and enjoyable. I was expecting a lot of talk about relationships, something like ""this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid..."|1
Thank God I didn't buy this movie myself! I borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! This has got to be one of THE worse movies I've EVER seen! I do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but I swear I could make a better movie than this staring my pets! The acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, EVERYTHING! It was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as I watched it!|1
The reason why this movie sucks, have these people even read a bible? Everything in the movie was about moses, God was staying out of it. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Also the people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived at Canan and betrayed God again! They didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it, It was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a Bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again.|1
While this is horribly dated , I MUST insist ... PLEASE , NO REMAKE ! Frankly , it just woouldn”t have any idea what we’re talking about. A couple of people that’s all i’m say”t know a whole lot about what’s being said and what’s being proposed but if you’d rather know what they want you can try to find out on their site. Just because a bunch of these guys are trying to get attention , you can’t just keep talking about the whole thing.|0
We all know that the world is full of dodgy , rip-off horror films . Some of these can be as frightening as the rest, and we can be certain that no one else in the world can be as gruesome . So now we have these horror movies that will make us cry . There are plenty of others that can be as shocking as they look . The most disturbing ones will be those that will be the most horrifying in terms of their content . There are too many, but there will always be one or two that will be interesting to watch in a horror movie .|0
I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director's new movie After Sundown. The first time that I saw this movie the director was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy looking hand popped out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not take it any more I busted out laughing right in front of the guy. The movie has no direction whatsoever and the one thing that could make this movie decent (Female Nudity) was nowhere to be found.|1
I have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the Disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve, and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie for all young girls. This movie is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values that any mother would love to encourage on there little girls. With the great songs and dance moves, it gets my daughter up and trying to mimic the moves. The extras are also good, one even works on how good your memory is.|1
Well, it took them 4 tries, but they finally got it right! In this 4th sequel to the Karate Kid franchise, the producers really hit a home run! Well first of all I applaud them for finally getting rid of Ralph Macchio. I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. I would have rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl!|1
"In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their ""Silly Symphonies"" series, ""The Skeleton Dance"". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney's ""Laugh-O-Gram"" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog)."|1
This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning.|1
"I saw this movie with my mother, and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (Not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) They never make movies like this...ever! My favorite part is when Grace(Minnie Driver) finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death, and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams, ""WHAT WAS GOD THINKING?"" I do believe everyone(No matter who you believe in) has thoughts like that once in awhile."|1
There 's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon 's `` Robe d'Ete '' . It 's surprising how much time was spent reading and commenting on some of the things that made the book one of the best science fiction of all time. The story of a scientist being rescued from a comet by his partner, an American scientist, a man who turns out to be a monster who turns out to be a monster, and what do you find when you read this book? What is it about this guy in the book and what can you learn from it?|0
"""Carlito's Angels"" is a spoof of ""Charlie's Angels"" that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times, however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well - it is amateurish and juvenile (I think ""fast-motion"" stopped being funny around 1914). The assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! The girls themselves are hot & adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even though they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination."|1
This weird movie from Texas is about Fallon , a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s ( although he's not likeable now) and his love interest, his wife, Martha. This is one of the best films you've ever seen , and it's hard for you to see how it works. I have been watching it for about a month. But it's like I've never seen it before, even after all these years. It's great. It's just so much fun and entertaining. I don't really get it.|0
Peter Strauss , by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films , often gets an unfairly high proportion of press coverage. The truth is that he's not a big-time writer either. But his writing is getting attention. At the end of last year, as the New York Times article reported, in a post about his upcoming novel, which is currently being completed, Strauss wrote an article in an online magazine entitled “The New York Post” asking what might be the most interesting piece of art that he's been working on.|0
"8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, shortly after first seeing this film, I took a critical view, feeling that Lemmon and Matthau had basically ""phoned-in"" their performances, which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously.But upon seeing it again, it seemed different, especially in view that neither of the two main mega-stars lived a great deal longer after its release.With the exception of Spiner, all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience, and likewise unavoidably a lot ""longer in tooth"" than we've seen in many of their other film and t.v."|1
This is an account of events that have been covered in print several times, and I had read two books - 'A Voyage for Madmen' and 'The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst' before seeing the film in Sheffield just before Christmas. I must say, it exceeded all expectations in its telling of the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe yacht race. These men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support vessels, wooden boats, no satellite phones, no GPS, and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece.|1
This movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals . One of the worst movie that I have seen on this show . . . The other 2 stories were the main story and 4 stories that were about the movie I was in. I would highly recommend that if you were to make a movie with an older story, or if you were to make a sequel, this film is definitely worth the investment . I have seen this film a lot, but I am just going to give it a try . . .|0
A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It isn't relevant whether its a remake or an adaptation.A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor movie, regardless.Sarkar, I am afraid, was a very poor movie. First of all, just by making characters look dangerous, or macho, they don't bring in an aura about them.What was so brilliant about Nagre(Amitabh Bacchan's character) that we should have been in aura of his 'power' and what showed the 'benevolence' of the character?|1
Oh boy . Films like this really bother me . If this movie is supposed to close to truth , it will . . . it’s . . . a movie . . . maybe not . but . . . an act . . . and if it’s . . . an act . . . and if . . . is what I think . . . then it’s not . . . just a . . . like a . . . maybe . . . just a movie . . . or . . . or if . . .|0
It 's been a long time since I have been in the art-house theater and I went to see Douches. I don't do that much theater, but when I saw the new show on HBO, I wanted to get to know it. I knew I wanted to talk to a bunch of great people and I felt like it was my first chance. I went to the show, and I was really excited for this one. It was the first time that I would see another show on HBO, and I found myself sitting there in my chair and thinking to myself, _What's the good news?|0
While I hold its predecessor , `` Fast Times At Ridgemont High , '' as a standard to which other countries are now adhered , I am not satisfied with this decision.'' After that I have to say, it's very interesting that this one is coming back. Why am I not the right person to tell this? It's not that there is nothing wrong with it. What we know is that, for the first time in the history of technology, it is the most powerful of all technologies. There are so many things there, you get to see them.|0
"I rented this movie, because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40's time setting, and thought ""hmm, can't be too bad."" Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was ""not too good"".Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess. And Melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance."|1
This is the worst movie I have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from Asperger's syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. One comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear?|1
Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in Creation , which recounts the period of Charles Darwin’s life in which he wrote, published, published in the United States, “The Origin of Species” and other books, in the late 20th century and early 30s. In the wake of the book The Origin of Species, it would be difficult to know the precise extent to which the evolution of the world had taken place, or to define the evolution of the human race before it was done.|0
"I recently viewed a copy of this ( under the title 'Eaten Alive ' ) Talk about dreadful ! Anybody have the same reaction as me and what did you get ! First off I want to say that this is what I would have liked to see in an animated episode :/

Now we have a cartoon. What was it exactly? Oh yes, a cartoon that looks like this ( I hope it'll be a cartoon, it's not just a cartoon ). And here we have the cartoon. I think its very simple, a cartoon with an orange and pink background on the side."|0
"I 'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere , given enough time maybe the film could be re-done in several years time . If not , please tell me where I can find this film to watch and if you have a video I would like to hear it if someone can help me get it on the web or send it . Also, please let me know of any other videos you would have a chance of seeing. I would be glad if you would like me to help you if you ever get interested . Thanks a lot 

EDIT
It's not a film ."|0
Oh what the heck , I 'll reveal the secret : this movie stinks ! Yeah there are some nifty things going on in the movies, so be warned : there's a whole load of strange things ! I mean a lot of these are the kind of scenes where you can't make sense of the characters but I'll take you through some of those and see some interesting things to see ! Also if you are curious about what's going on in the movie I think I'd be really interested in what is being portrayed in the movie.|0
"Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer campers but I can't tell you how excited I've been to see the film. The movie has been in the news around the world, but it has so far received the attention of both Hollywood and Fox. There were only two negative comments on Friday. First: ""It’s an absolutely awful movie. How could they ever put it in their theaters?"" Second: ""I wish it had been in theaters."" So I’ll be honest."|0
This film gives new meaning to the term `` uneven '' , giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by its lack of action. In the film we see a woman wearing a black and white outfit, the man holding up a knife to break his broken heart. The woman looks up and gives us a sympathetic eye to the man holding up his gun. The first act is an ordinary scene where the woman pulls up the curtains in her closet and the man is waiting for her. She looks like her husband.|0
I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic , sexual , crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this. However, when I was done, it was still a novella . It wasn't just sex. It was a bit of everything , it wasn't anything in the first place, it was a little bit more than what I had originally expected, and it might have had something to do with that. It's one of the first graphic novels that I've been able to go through, and it's a solid one .|0
Produced by Nott Entertainment , this movie is `` nott '' very good at all . I sat through the entire thing and realized the movie was pretty good, but it wasn't very entertaining, and I was still kind of lost in this film and I was just looking at it with interest . So I did a little research, and decided that this movie was an excellent experience for me because of the way it was filmed . So I decided to get a taste of what this movie was really like in the last few years.|0
I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors.The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that cliché? Marry in haste, repent at leisure...|1
Although i watched this film by myself ( thankfully ) , i still felt embarrassed while watching it . I think its because i didn’t realize its age , but this film is my life. I saw the film at the end of last season, I was scared by it. I saw the film for the first time before I started to watch it at that time. I felt bad that i never watched it again and it didn’t help . I saw the movie again on Saturday night , it was fantastic .|0
"Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda . It came no wonder . . ."" ""This isn't what this shit was made for!"" the voice cried out. # **Chapter 17**

Since I'd bought the DVD, I watched as much of this as I did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. Complications ensue.Douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. He's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.The plot rambles on.|1
this movie gets a 10 because there is a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an Italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot.everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one.since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn't matter to me.the Italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie.this is one of the goriest Italian movies you will ever see.no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection.buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true.|1
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date , this year , it is one of my favorites . The actors are very talented, the dialogue , the movie is well directed, the story is pretty funny . This year , it is one of the best and I love the film as well as the director. It is a very funny movie , it is a little bit hard to tell with words and actors , but the main storyline is good , and I believe it is very funny movie . The film is well written and composed , it looks like it is written by one of the very talented actors.|0
"Obviously, someone was looking at catching onto the ""Blair Witch"" wave.This movie was set up like all the ""reality"" haunted shows that are popping up on TV lately (and I must admit, I get a kick out of these), but this movie is MUCH cheesier! Probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the ""participants"" going through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time. Any paranormal happenings are blatant setups."|1
Goldrush : A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages . The movie focuses around a mysterious village with a lot to do . There is no real way of knowing the exact location, but the main characters are just going to have fun with it. We have no idea how the story is going to work , but one thing is sure , it will be interesting . And we have to learn how to manage the story as well. The main story takes place during a time of conflict between the residents in a small village , whose main characters are just going to have fun doing it .|0
"Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! It takes a long-winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film, one supposes. Some have merely called the film ""contemplative"", meaning slow and devoid of plot, however, one Dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head: this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene. Here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a Realtor who, predictably, talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on."|1
I would give this a zero if they had that rating. Fun was no fun at all. I grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. The others I watched this movie with also agreed. The acting was annoying. I am tired of Jim Carey's over the top ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way.|1
I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick . Instead they go around and recreate it on their own, I think. They did a great job. What is it about film that’s fun to work on and how can you get to know it, and also what are your favorite aspects of it? It’s really fun to work on and I think I love the concept of making it so many times in the past. Is it that time of year that makes it enjoyable to be in a film?|0
This is primarily about love in WWII, yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.The movie's timing is just great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. While it may prove boring to some, the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.At one point, my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors.|1
Cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew it, we knew it...Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted..but they lived on.A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really to catch the final exploit biker film after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it.|1
How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me . I made an account on IMDb just now to share it with others . Thanks in advance. I am now sharing it on IMDB as I want to add more to it. I have had quite a few of people share my account, and many others have added my account. Now I want to take this account away. So I thought I would post my account. Here are the screenshots of mine . You can see how I created my account on IMDB. So now I want to create a new account.|0
After seeing this film I felt sick to my stomach and if I had seen one more minute I would have laughed and said I have no intention of doing it any further. There are people who go on the Internet, who make it a big part of their lives. They don’t know what they are looking for but they are the people that go on the Internet. They want to know what the movie is about but they are not really sure what they are looking for but they are the people that go on the Internet but are not who they say they are.|0
John Knowles modern masterpiece , A Separate Peace , are one of many subtle , and subtly is the watch , that has to be carefully and meticulously examined. In this piece of art, you can see what it is, what to look for; and you can find many ideas for what one can find in the art of war. On the side you can find what you think is true, but not necessarily the truth, and how to look for what you believe in, but also what is possible and not only possible.|0
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime. Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, wish they could land husbands, but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other).|1
"OK, Number one-this ""film"" is a ""90's"" version of a crappy show from the 70's that no one remembers! Number two-As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was like I walked in halfway through the movie! There was no plot! it was very annoying! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but It's just not believable to me that little skinny Omar Epps can chase down a big grown man, without a gun, and scare him into talking! It's a ridiculous ""plot""."|1
It 's out of question that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia . Apart from very distinctive differences, it's not clear that her real daughter is Princess Anastasia, she is Princess Anna . Anna's real name is Catherine Anderson. In fact, her real name is Anna Anderson . It's difficult to determine what Anna Anderson is, but we can make it clear, that she was Anna Anderson. The actual fact that she was Anna Anderson has been revealed by Anna Anderson, and this will be her real name . We will know more about it later.|0
I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director 's new role, and in the finale, I felt like I was in danger of being infected with something I did not already know. But that is not the reason I watched it. If you don't know the main reason for watching it, it is because that's what people are saying (and I don't think you're doing that here, but if you can figure it out, it might be worth it!)|0
"This movie was terrible. The acting was awful. The script was awful. What was even worse were the camera shots and sound. Half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to have been 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had ""recreated"" the top of the building."|1
"Have you ever wondered why these guys -- Seagal , Stallone , Willis , et al -- manage to survive in such a small universe? We asked the authors for their opinions on this matter. They have all responded in this way:

""Why does it matter where you go, when you're walking in your car and the sun shines like a star?"" ""Why are you walking in my car and looking at the street?"" You know how it is, sometimes you have a lot to think about, even if you never really get into the issue."|0
Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments , but I have to disagree on a couple of things . I think what I have said is a very well known fact and is well known to everybody . I know a lot of people know a lot more that I do . In the old days . It took me a while to get used to that, and now I can go in there and make them understand me . It is pretty hard to do so . The best way to do it now is to put them all into a couple of different situations .|0
When a movie 's claim to fame is that Martin Sheen 's younger , less known brother stars in it, is a good example of a good thing. I have been watching the movie for the past couple years, and I have never been in love with Sheen. In fact, I am a huge sucker for the movie. I have been obsessed with his character, and while I may not have had a crush on him, I've never read anything by him that I've not had an encounter with before. Sheen is not a bad person, though I think I have met some interesting characters.|0
This is a movie that should be viewed and treated as a piece of art . This is an oblivious person with a heart of gold which is like nothing I ever imagined. But it is clear that it is a movie which has nothing to do to it. What does that mean for the viewer? If we were to compare a film to what you would see on a television or film store and you would see it at the top, then what would it be like? It would be more than just a TV, a film theater. It would be a movie theatre.|0
There 's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima ( Meiko Kaji ) , Female Scorpion , and a pair of other male and female miniguns (Meiko Yoshida and Hironori Yamamura ) at the Nami's home located in Noma, Japan, and the two male miniguns are known to each other by name. The miniguns are a sort of double-faced sword and their heads are long. Each minigun is about five feet in diameter and is covered with a bright greenish brown. In their heads are a pair of eyes and ears, with the eyes in the front of each pair.|0
Carole Lombard and James Stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors, each with a different goal. Some are Capra-cute, some screwball, some melodramatic, and some surprisingly noir. There's even an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard. It's hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone, and the storyline not exactly believable.|1
this is horrible film . it is past dumb . first , the only thing the twins care about is that the boys don't see the world in the way the girls do . it is a little overkill . I mean it's an absolutely great film . it just looks good . that is why we thought it was funny . and also it is so funny to me . I have a theory that the boys are the reason why this film isn't funny . that is because the girls have no interest in comedy . there is a reason why these boys do comedy .|0
Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chan's Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx, and what do you get? You receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of Magoo-like madness.The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. Of course he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he had the gem.Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. There are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken.|1
A good story about Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would like to go to her mother's house. She does not want to see her parents and father, so she goes to the park and goes to a park that is right off the beaten path. As she is walking up the steps she sees her mother coming down the steps and she thinks that her father, who is wearing a black cap, is in the park. She goes back down the steps and looks back at her father, and sees him.|0
The film deals with universal themes, mentioning no specific country as its context: it could happen anywhere--and has, in substance if not form. Those concerned about 1st amendment issues, censorship, et al--but don't want to be bored with lectures--need art such as this to illustrate, dramatize, teach, inspire.Rickman is certainly an under appreciated character actor; he shines in this film, showing off multiple acting talents that you must see (I have yet to see him give a bad performance, though, even in not-so-great films).|1
"You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. Take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next, the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly, the jokes are either cliché or boring. If they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us ""laugh"", they are throwing various props around the room."|1
This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie . Remake a classic film shot-by-shot . I hope nobody will have a bad experience shooting such an epic and beautiful picture . I hope that the public will enjoy this great movie . If so I hope that you will be happy to see such a great picture . If so, please enjoy and have a wonderful time shooting such a great one . Thanks to everyone who supported this great picture . I also wish you a wonderful Christmas season to the world . I hope that you will celebrate Christmas by watching a great movie .|0
Oh boy . Where do I begin on this piece of slime ? This is one of the few real gems I’m seeing in a new line-up. If you look closely, you can notice that I have to use a little bit of a different shade to give the texture to the floor so you can see where that floor is going. I’ve had this happen to me over a month ago and this one I had for a couple of years now. But not only is it easy to notice the change to the overall look of this piece, but I can do it, too.|0
This movie is certainly well-constructed, beginning and ending in the dark, with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt, Julie Andrews,initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy.It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. While it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown, 'cinema vulgaris', and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong. Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates.|1
Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I get involved. The works. I want to get involved. I'm spending time watching the thing. I watched the emmys last night on TV. How in the infinite world was the Empire Falls (excellent name)TV movie up for any awards? It truly had wonderful talent. Of course. And they tried admirably. But how can ANYONE pretend that was an OK (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? OK direction?|1
This is truly , without exaggerating , one of the worst Slasher movies ever made . I know , it has nothing to do with science fiction, but this was certainly the first film in it’s canon . And I’m sorry for anyone who might not have seen the movie before but I will try and not spoil it , because I’ve not seen anything so good. I mean, even if it made it look like it was a science fiction movie, it is a masterpiece . . . Okay. I was watching the film yesterday and noticed that it was not a science fiction movie.|0
This short subject gathered kudos from all kinds of places for its plea for religious toleration . After a session with the Archbishop of Rome, I spoke with him at his own request . At the end of the afternoon, he gave me the impression that if there is one thing I really believe in, it is for the Church . I told him that in the Bible we have the word “sacramentalism” in Latin . So I can only say that the Bible is the very essence and the most essential part of religion .|0
What a silly movie . While it looks nice , it does n't make a lot of sense . On one level, it's a bad film that does nothing but make a mockery of itself . The movie is a lot better than this, except that it is more about how the story works than how it is about how it is about real life . In fact, this would be a shame if it wasn't as bad as the movie's premise . But in the end, the movie is not a real movie . If you want to read more about this film , you should go into it .|0
Steven Segal 's movie career is a tribute to horrible cinema . I have been tragically bored with every one of the films I have read. I have a lot of good reviews . But in spite of it's great, there is a lot of mediocre films I haven't read . . . It's not just me, I know. And it's not because of me or the movie, it is because of all the movies that have been put out . . . So many movies. I can't help it.|0
"Where do we start with an offering like this? I nearly said film but that would be going a step too far. The only thing hellish about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and nonsense, baloney and balderdash. These films should carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the dunderheads who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like it's sister in arms ""League of Extraordinary Twaddle""."|1
Less Than Zero could have been the 80s movie that reveals teenage apathy in its most extreme form had they actually stuck to the damn book. But, where they hadn't, this movie presents does the job, and leaves you with the creepiest feeling when its all over in ways not done until the late nineties with Larry Clark's movies 'Kids' and 'Bully.' Societal outcast teens are faced with a rather curious dilemma (they don't treat it much like one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) boasts to them that he killed a teenage girl near the river's edge in their suburban town.|1
It was 1983 and I was 13. I watched Valley Girl on HBO one night when my parents were working. After it ended I wanted to talk with someone about it immediately. Turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that we watched it until we could recite it. We woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically. We began to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I am not saying this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally.|1
I have seen both the MST3K version and the uncut version. I rather enjoyed it. Either way, it wasn't that bad of a movie. Sure it moved a bit slow at times. I liked it.As far as MST3K goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights for. Not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies, it was just so easy to make fun of them. Take SoulTaker for example.Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly I couldn't help but laugh. I couldn't take them seriously.|1
Your ability to enjoy The Ashes of Time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater . Even when your expectations are met by a more demanding performance, your performances are still something to admire. And you're going to love them. But when you're in the performance, there are a whole lot of things to think about. Let's take a look at these six key elements for the most enjoyable performances at the play. First, I want to take a moment to thank everyone involved in getting us out there.|0
I watched this movie and all I can say is this...I am not a film student, nor am I some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that I don't understand. However, IF I were to do that with this film, my thoughts would be...Yep! He's on drugs and I can picture it now...he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like, hey...wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly?|1
I have been a huge Errol Morris fan ever since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a whole lot of his life. I love the music and the writing so I have been looking for the best pieces of music I could get from this guy. I just love his work so I have no hesitation in asking for it. He’s very talented, and has done well. He’s got lots of fans, and I love him for that! I also like his writing, and he’s able to write a long piece that we both enjoy and enjoy.|0
I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they'd like. Most little girls would like this story, even though there is the thought of death in it. Although no one dies, the king almost does, but little girls would not understand it, so it adds up to make a perfect story. All the events add up, creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough.|1
"So well done . The photography , sound , music and the performances were the best . It 's also very well done . I 'm very excited to do the project and get to work with this guy . About

This is the place for all of your professional music projects. The place for all your electronic music projects. If you are interested in doing music projects as well you are in for a surprise! We are a very talented company! We are an extremely professional music studio team and have many of the most talented musicians to collaborate with!"|0
This was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX some 14 years later, the WWE crammed so many matches on it, some of the matches were useless. I'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do.However major highlights included the HUGE pop for Demolition winning the tag team belts from Haku and Andre the Giant, The first ever mixed tag match featuring Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri vs Dusty Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first ever clash between The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan.Some matches were a complete waste of time.|1
This new movie by Jeskid is awesome! Check it out and you'll be amazed. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken home, whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her sketchbook. Until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her, and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil. Both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away. The music is incredible as well, it really intesifies the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict.|1
Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That style of movie-making was out of favour in the late seventies). Rather, it more closely resembles a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a video nasty. At least, the shortened 150 minute version does. I have never seen the full 210 minute version, but to judge from the descriptions of it on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a video nasty.|1
Not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.While the film is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. The over the top performance by William Baldwin doesn't help the situation either. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better.|1
"Fred Carpenter screened Eddie Monroe at Boston College , and judging from the enthusiastic response , he has much to gain from studying the finer points of the field. That's why, while you might try to dig up some links, here are some videos that you could check out. This is an excellent video of some of his early work that shows some things that have been shown in this video:

If you're like most college students, you're probably tired of hearing about people that are trying their hardest to beat you in the world of football."|0
I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right. Luther starts out well enough... his origin at the circus, a creepy run at a supermarket, an attack of an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely. A hot sex/ shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house.|1
"I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone . He 's one of my favorite actors , who is just as famous as Albert Finney in every way that I have seen him."" He is also one of the best and most recognized actors in London. He has performed for many of the top actors in the industry including:

Robert Redford
Robert Pattinson
Henry Kissinger
Dennis Hall
George Cahan
Brent Nichols

As of this writing: Albert Finney is no longer a professional actor. But he has found another actor who will serve him well."|0
After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY ( which is still my favorite Dassin ) I was more than a bit disappointed to see Night and the City , and I couldn't even find the time to do much about it , so I looked it up and found out what it is but couldn't be bothered. So I did a search and found that I really need to know more about this city. My question was, does this have any real meaning to the people in the area and what its meaning can be?|0
It is sad that some find this film worth watching . I am Russian , and I am disgusted . I know there are a lot of different versions of it, I just really want to see it , but for me it is really good . I am not an expert in this movie , I know there are more than 1 dozen different versions of the movie . This is not the first time I have been in love with it . This movie, I always thought, made me so much more of a lover in love.|0
You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it.|1
"**SPOILERS** I rented ""Tesis"" (or ""Thesis"" in English) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar's later effort ""The Others"". Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, I assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead I wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie I've seen since the German film ""Anatomie"" (which this one kinda reminded me of).The plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes."|1
"Michael Bassett 's film 'Solomon Kane ' ( based on the character of the same name created by Robert E. Howard )

A New York Times editorial said the movie had been shot in the UK, and was seen only in Germany, France and Switzerland. The film, which was screened at the Venice Film Festival in 2007, is a follow up to the 2005 American production, starring the British film and TV star Robert E. Howard, who had been made to film the UK premiere on September 17, 2007, in Berlin."|0
"Not a box office success; no-one really knows why. It may have failed simply because of its title. It looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Hard Weapon"", ""Die Lethal"", etc. - talking about ""the long kiss goodnight"" will get you nowhere. But for once Renny Harlin has made a GOOD action movie. A large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, earns our affection and interest early on."|1
This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches . Sadly it was obvious throughout up until now, that there are a lot of films that go by this definition. This is not a debate about whether a certain aspect of a plot should be taken for granted or not, just a simple question of whether there are good and bad actors. When it comes to the main story, there are many, many different things that should be looked at for the reasons that you are reading this book and why they are relevant.|0
The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie and I didn't think about the movie or the Kim Possible show. But that wasn't what I was saying at the time. So, when I saw it and noticed it, it was because it was the first time I'd ever seen the Kim Possible show and it was in one of those spots on the screen. I never knew it was there until the day I watched the movie. Because I knew I didn't even know who it was at that time.|0
Always enjoy the Classic Horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if they had made it, they'd have gotten it. It's a great movie, but it's still a great film. The acting is fantastic, they did a brilliant performance, it's great, the acting was impressive, but the visuals were horrible. We were very disappointed, we thought the visuals were horrible as well, but they did an amazing job of portraying the horror scenes, the acting is great, and the cinematography was awesome.|0
I watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was shaping up to be a great thriller. A very talented cast and good dialogue.Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes.A great thriller was flushed down the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.I gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. I think that's a little generous, but I was entertained for a while.|1
David Cronenberg 's ` eXistenZ ' is a well designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism . It addresses the question of how to make it clear how to understand the relationship between existentialism and existentialism in a more abstract way. And, finally, it attempts to answer that question by asking the existentialist: what does existentialism really mean? I’ve had the pleasure of working with you on this fascinating project, ‘The Metaphysical Conception of Existence,’ which has developed a lot of interest in existentialist theory for the last decade.|0
I 'm a huge Zack Allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie . It was so fun, and it was well received by fans. I think the only way you get a few scenes for every one that you do is to just have a few more. This is the way a lot of movies can be a little bit boring. So I was trying to find out if this was the right way to get a few scenes that I'm proud to have got. And I was disappointed.|0
"When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home, Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid. Despite the title ""Acrobatty Bunny"", it's only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even leading up to that, it's quite funny what Bugs does to escape getting eaten; somehow, he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him, and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in ""Big Top Bunny""."|1
"One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with ""Only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic Romance/Adventure Holywood movies...,"" as if those weren't reason enough to love it! Anyone who, after seeing this movie, complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical verisimilitude, or the realism of the political motivations, or any other extra-movie concerns, simply doesn't love movies. See it and be awed by the star-power of the two leads, the exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film."|1
So many of us who are devoted to the `` art '' of the motion picture will disregard or forget the fact that a motion picture camera has no motion picture mode and only one mode of image. For those who want to avoid camera lag and the camera's shutter speed, the most important factor that you must consider is that you may not want to use the same camera during the whole shot of your film which you shot. Therefore, you must not try and change the motion picture. It is important to keep the camera stationary.|0
Yep, it's me again! Mr 'I sit through crap so you don't have to'.What do you think this is about? Could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area? Then her cross-dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor, before they make off together with his cash? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant DA to nail these suckers, what conclusion will you come to?|1
This Is one of those classic American made for TV movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon. Although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery / horror film best enjoyed with a bid bag of popcorn or box of chocolates. A big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round Lake Tommahawk I for one would not mind living there!All in all a great film to watch over and over again.|1
"I 've been a fan of Larry King 's show for awhile , I think he does a terrific job. I do think he does a terrific job, but there are so many other things I'd like to mention about him that make the show more of a ""wow"" experience. I can't imagine how I would describe it. I agree that there are many people around here who are great performers. And there are great performers around the world who are great people, even if they don't perform for a lot of people."|0
For Native Mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis . Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha . A native Mongolian speaker , Jamukha, is shown to be more intelligent than his native Russian language. Native Mongolians can easily be compared to Chinese speakers, but not much more. The Mongolian language can be more easily identified by the presence of English. Jamukha can be familiar to both Chinese and English speakers, but there is no similarity in his ability to understand Mongolian. Jamukha’s ability to communicate is more limited than his native Russian language.|0
Having lived in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this film. It begins promisingly enough, with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of U.P. life. But Jeff Daniels apparently was not content with a low-key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people. Instead, he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical/supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the U.S., this is NOT it.|1
I have heard that Novo was compared to Memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, that's like comparing The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people. They couldn't be further apart in ideas.Novo deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss. He is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes a temp who also gets involved with him and may/may not use him for sex.|1
This is the Australian TV series. It is a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet being ambushed? This is cult TV. The Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure. The music and song just fantastic. The closing credits starting with the close up of the wheel, then Keir sleeping n being jostled around and then the long shot just cannot get much better than that.|1
"and there are not many in cinema history. ""Rouge"" seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope in mankind and in life. But to say only that may be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. Perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. But what to say about this master of the camera? You can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces."|1
"I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect, but under the title ""The Americanization of Lily"" this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more, and still loved by those who recognized its special Blake Edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness, clever humor and solid narrative. The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith, a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too, for Germany but neither cruel nor political, merely opportunistic."|1
"Being a bit of a connoisseur of garbage , I have stumbled across this little treasure . Action , romance , a bit of both, I can't wait to dive deep into it. If you like to read this , you may also be interested in the following books . I'm really trying to find my way into writing these and I'd love to have you guys help out. Thank you . . . Action

I think this is the first of many things I've written to give back in the form of food."|0
This must be the most boring film I ever saw. The only positive I can say about it is that thankfully I didn't pay to see it. We were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start. This piece of junk is a badly filmed, way too long film. The actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present. The only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why. They might find some of the interviews interesting.|1
"Oh dear ! What can I say about Half Past Dead ? I was really disappointed in it . I thought I was the only one who enjoyed this movie , and I suppose it was an amazing experience ! :D

I loved the whole movie , and even thought of how I was enjoying the rest of the movie , but I didn't enjoy this one . I was pleasantly surprised with it . I wasn't a fan of movies like it , but i really enjoy it , it had so much more character and it really gave me more time for it ."|0
This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today . Horribly predictable , obscene usage of time and resources . All of the show is utterly awful and is not worth watching. You would think that the show would be an improvement over it, but this is not so. The show really does deserve its share of blame for being so damn bad , and if it was that bad, the show would be a failure and the show could easily be forgotten. All of the main characters are in very good spirits , so why would the main cast make a difference ?|0
when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing (especially when they were getting chased by the water, and when the guy drove through peoples gardens, i mean would it hurt to drive around the washing line?) the special effects! this movie clearly didn't have a big budget. either that or the guy left his toddler in charge of the controls. the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had fizzed up. what were the actors thinking? did they actually believe that it was a good movie?|1
A woman in love with her husband ( he 's suicidal ) decides to have a baby to save his life . In fact, his wife decides to kill him before she knows how he will survive the next couple of months after the baby is born . The baby will be born in the next two to three hours . She decides to go to the hospital to take care of the baby before she takes the baby away . When he comes back she says she will have a baby, and she decides to have another one as a reward for a chance to save her husband's life .|0
I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Luckily, my hopes have came true. You got a whole bunch of action, comedy...silly comedy, and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison, is really a hit in the movie, but I really find Sam's 'Alien' stupidly annoying with English. Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese.|1
I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it . It's very sexy and sexy. I'm not going to lie. If you're looking for this kind of movie that I'd recommend it's a must-have but you're going to need a lot of patience. You might just have to get used to it. I think we all do, but it will do you good if you get to see some of the elements of this movie in detail. For the most part, this movie is a little over-the-top .|0
"`` The next Karate Kid '' is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises . It has a variety of styles, so you will have to be aware of how to make sure you are setting up a Karate Kid movie at home. 1. Choose the genre

2. Choose which movies will be shown

3. On the top of the box you will have to choose a genre which will be shown in the box. Choose the type of movie that will be shown so that it will fit the type of genre to which you want."|0
In this follow up to The Naked Civil Servant we see the final years of Quentin Crisp 's life in a similar fashion. I am a big fan of Crisp as a journalist and editor and have always been keen on his writing. I am also an avid collector, so there are many interesting books to read and read about Crisp and I hope to contribute to the new book in the next post. Please feel free to comment if you find any interesting as this is a huge time saver, and the book will be a great gift for you.|0
While not as bad as some movies ( like the horrible `` Atomic Twister '' ) , `` Meltdown '' and so on are known, which makes the story seem more realistic than it really is. But the real problem lies in the characters. And they do not have any clue about how they are doing their jobs. In fact they do not even realise what is going on in their world. One of my favorite movies ever made was a movie where one of the main characters was an evil doctor who did not want anything to do with women.|0
Bad, bad, movie, so bad it is worth watching. As long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. The special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny. If your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her?|1
This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA, who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop. Actually, it's really just about the girl (Nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The movie gets going extremely fast, and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length. It isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere.The story is not only paper-thin, but unstructured, stupid, and incoherent.|1
"This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA , who end up getting caught and thrown in prison. The scene in question was shot on the day of their arrival in Los Angeles and was shot with the help of a cameraman. It is a very brief movie but I’m sure the movie would make you laugh : )

It is a great movie but there is a huge difference from the real life in LA. In the first scene we get to know the guy’s parents, while we’re at home watching TV."|0
"I was forced to watch this film for my World Reigonal Geography class . This film is what is wrong with the story . I want to read the story and know if I should change my mind . I have no idea how to change my mind . Monday, September 30, 2015

I know, it’s not that hard! As I watched the film, I have to confess that, despite how much I like to keep up with the movies, they have their moments. This was my second time reading the film, and it was such a joy to sit down and watch the film."|0
I didn't even watch this whole movie. Now, I like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. For one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. He sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. Out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at Earth and this boob says 'Can you see Brooklyn?' and another guy says 'Sure'. And the boob says 'Gee, I wonder who's pitching?'|1
Don't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience I've ever had... It is plain and right AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. It can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you.|1
This is the worst movie I have ever seen . If I was n't watching it for free , I would go back and read it . It will make my life a living hell . It will also make me cry with all of my rage. I am sorry I'm not here , because it will be my fault that I was so quiet . I will not be the only one to kill myself , I am sorry if this is my fault. I will take all of my strength and all of my money .|0
It 's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead , this has solid sex scenes. However, I think in the time since I started watching this I 've found that the only thing that I want to see most is love. One of my favourite scenes of the series. I loved this one as well. (I watched the second one on my computer so I knew exactly where to look for this one - the very first time I 'd watched it myself. I hope that you like it too.)|0
I have watched two episodes so far , I really like it . Even though I am no longer in it , I think the two are very close , I'm looking forward to watching it and looking for it again . Thanks for the suggestion . Thanks for the comments , I don't want to watch any of the other 2 episodes but I'd love to. I just need a little bit more insight into your experience and what you have learned and what you need to get the most out of it. Thanks . You need to watch it first because it is pretty much what you're after .|0
"Maybe we Aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here . . ."" ""You are just like them!"" she said. She was as much a joke as he was a fool.

After their star cross-country runner dies after a race , the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a bullet in the back of their head . The team leader’s identity is revealed in photos taken by the event’s organizers , which were shown live on YouTube and on social media on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2018. The clip shows the three men riding a bike, as well as the three other cyclists who are running a race. “I’ve never seen a driver in a race that was shot on fire before,” one man was quoted as saying.|0
There needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this . It was painful to watch , but strangely, it’s not too painful to watch . The reason for the “don’t let this go” message is pretty simple : there are two things I do not want you to notice : I am not very clear about what I want you to watch or I’m not pretty sure that you’re doing that. I’m not really making it easy to find an answer to it but, I would not want to get bogged down by a “not pretty” list.|0
I could not believe what i saw...(once) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made. The plots are dreadful and the dialogue appauling (at first i thought it was a spoof), and the acting abysmal. Everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops, a bunch of paintings enlarged. Respectable filmakers struggle to get their vision realised, yet this blasphemous, pathetic attempt at a mini-series makes it to our television's, with 3 oscar winners making appearances.|1
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language, and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, sweeping storyline), the director attempts more than just to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point, though it is a simplistic one.|1
"Imagine what it must have been like for John Agar. One of Hollywood's handsome leading men. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He finds himself doing movies like this. I remember him in ""Tarantula"" where he wasn't half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. The monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. The teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There's dancing that goes on and on, and then there is no attack."|1
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash raj film so at first when you see the promos you think yes thats definitely another yash raj hit But when you see the film your eyes will water with disappoint the storyline is stupid and dumb we've seen it many times boy is soon to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah. if you do see this pathetic film don't go with you family there is too much exposure and kiss scene. i don even see why you would go to see it on your own.|1
I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it . It was one of those movies where you would find a movie you didn't really like. And it's very, very, very funny, but also very, very entertaining, and if you do not like the movie, you might even like it. So yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot and maybe I've got a few of the best ones. But the first one is very, very funny. I was wondering what would happen to it if I rented this?|0
Frank Sinatra has one of his best roles as a reformed heroin addict coming back to his Chicago neighborhood after an extensive stay in a clinic. He plans to stay off the drug and find work as a drummer, but he can't avoid running into his old friends. He had been arrested originally not for any drug-related charge, but because he was caught dealing in an illegal poker game. His skill at poker has earned him the nickname of The Man with the Golden Arm, and the men who run the game, one of them being his former heroin connection, want him to deal again.|1
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV . I only wish I had done it sooner, not because it was more popular than anything, and it may be more than I can say for a movie of the sort I have seen in years. I have watched it a dozen times in my lifetime and never really looked back. It’s my first time to see the movies, and it was the best I have been able to do since that day in 2007. The first time I got to see the movies, I had the same feeling as the first time.|0
This film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry ' because this was 'like watching food' and that it also was an essential part of our culture. These are some of the books I recommend to you, and you'll also find them on the Amazon site. I think the best way to tell the story and how our society is functioning is to take a time-lapse sequence in the film that follows it, and to make sure we have it right next to where the story ends.|0
To even say that this film is Sebastien 's work at his best just tell you everything you have to say, because it's an incredible film. He has his work cut in black and white so he can't give away spoilers so he doesn't get any spoilers when you're listening to him tell his story and he's just trying to cover everything he doesn't want it to cover. It's an amazing film so I can't say it's his masterpiece so if he doesn't take anything you're gonna think I don't know what I'm talking about or not at all.|0
I have just started watching this show. Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30pm in the Afternoon (as of 26th July 2006).This program literally makes me laugh out aloud and I cannot boast that on most sitcom's (apart from UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it).Todays episode of TKoQ (26 July 2006)was the one where Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no 'outside' friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his 'belly hair!'|1
"I saw this superb documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely absorbing and very well crafted, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most overlooked musical talents of the 1960's and 70's. While I was familiar with his better known compositions (""One is the Loneliest Number"", ""Without You""), I learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful singing. If you love music, you'll find plenty to draw you in to his world, which unfortunately spiraled out of control as his success increased and his past haunted him."|1
OK , if you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and love to mock movies , then you know that this is the movie you have most loved this season. It will be a great one to see and enjoy, but this will be just a couple of things to watch. This one will have a lot of great action to it. If you enjoy a movie, this is probably your best chance of coming up with a movie like this one. You will enjoy it, and you’ll love it. So go ahead and enjoy it.|0
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on . It brings back happy times for me . I grow so tired thinking about it, but I've really been a fan and really enjoy it. . It is my favorite band. I can't put it down because it is heavy, and it's not my favorite band. But I'll be back next month. I'll be with the band again! I can't be happier about it. I've been working hard. I'm excited to get back with the group again.|0
Well , I 'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento , Fulci , and Giusti . But in this case I have come up with a really cool idea (for now I'll be using a different movie format) . This is not one of those movies I really enjoy . The idea of the movie is that it will tell me what I am really about but it doesn't show me anything. So I just do it on the DVD and do the movie there . It will not show me anything in my head.|0
"The third entry in the `` Stepford '' franchise , but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure. In this post I'll show you the other four main reasons to be interested:

For the first and foremost it's a TV show. If you're new to the show, take a look at this site and get a taste. For the second and foremost it's an adventure. If you're new to the show, make sure to get a visual of the first episode. For the third and foremost it's a mystery."|0
This movie was made by Daiei Studios , known for its Gamera movies . It is about a samurai lord who comes to the world to fight with a beautiful woman, who is the mother of his daughter. In the world, there is always someone to protect his people. The world has to fight in order to get to the people in need. Here in Tokyo, a guy who is trying to get the girl to marry him also tries to take revenge on her by killing her. But the man has not succeeded in doing so and does not take responsibility for what he does.|0
I found this movie to be a big disappointment , especially considering the cast . The characters are not believable , they are very dark . The dialogue is a bit shaky , the acting is weak . It’s hard to find a great actress to work with , the cast and actors are all great. I have to say, I highly recommended this one to everyone I ever went to. The first thing I did was to rewatch the original . There were a few differences. First of all, she had to play the main character, but she does it all for free .|0
"Such pain ! Pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea , but it never fully satisfied , it never had the substance of an actual pain. Pain was the very essence of every man and was not to be given up. He had to work harder, he had to work more hard, to be patient. When we were young , he used to go to school to study with a doctor who told him, "" you can't take the class."" And then we would take classes , there would be no pain!"|0
This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray . That 's one of the very first things you learn about me, in this episode. It is something that comes naturally to you, which can be frustrating, and also makes you look at what you know, or you know more about the story and what it is going to be for the story. And for me, learning the art of playing games is a lot more important now than ever before, because in that time I have been working hard and trying to try to teach you to be a better player.|0
Based on what little i have seen of this show I don't think I will ever watch it again. Its not even remotely believable and frankly the Derek character just makes me angry.Sorry but seeing such a spoiled brat get his way time and again? Why would i want to watch that?!? No thanks, there are plenty of other shows that involve devious characters (Phil of the Future's Pim for example) where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they though.Not to mention that I think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step-siblings.|1
This is an adaptation of an Edith Wharton work , whose writing is amazing . Sadly , this movie never appeared on YouTube , despite the fact it was available on . A new film will be coming out in the UK this year , and this week it will be seen in Japan , but we are not really sure. It’s due to be released soon, and is scheduled to run for about 6 months. Accordingly, this is a new movie, and a new set, with some of the elements that you will see this time around in other countries.|0
Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts . What WAS he thinking ? This is a movie that I have been having some trouble with and I know it is not for me . I am a professional movie writer but I have been able to get a little of my work published, and this is my first post. I am hoping you all will let me know if this was the correct format for my previous post. The problem is that this post was based off a post I read recently about a new movie I wrote that I did not like and I did not pay attention to.|0
I must say I thought the show Greek would be really ridiculous and stupid . Since I am part of the cast of the series, I don’t know if I’d have been impressed by this series if they had not come out earlier. I have only been to Greece since the beginning. So I hope you like it. When I first saw the film, my friend, I was really excited by it. A lot of the time, I’m thinking I was in Athens, which I’m sorry I didn’t come to.|0
Director Kinji Fukasaku is perhaps best known, in his homeland at least, for his Japanese gangster films, a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics. Violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both Shogun's Samurai and Battles Without Honor and Humanity, and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals. Both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die, and since so little is done to develop them, their deaths have little impact when they do come. This film has other flaws as well.|1
[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!] Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle were in a rut. They basically had no life at all. All they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. Jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. He needed a life. So he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. A singles' bar was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music started and Jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: Jon killed it.|1

On Thursday, May 4, 2011, a jury heard in New York City's Suffolk County District Court that two men had broken into a house belonging to their former husband, and were sentenced to 30 years' probation and a $100 fine in connection to the incident that left nine people dead and 13 people injured."|0
This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen , and I have seen well over 300 movies in the last 15 years! It’s a horror film, no less! It’s a story of a young woman, who is forced to choose her own life. In this movie, she is trapped inside an apartment, forced to make a choice of the future she wishes for and her own life in this new world that no one has been able to predict for themselves. This is not a comedy, though. This movie is not good enough!|0
I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous. What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.|1
I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min , luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my life! I had been looking forward to my 10 min walk with friends on Sunday but now I have no time to watch the first 20 min . I have never had so much fun with my friends , I just have no time for them and i have lost everything I had ever wanted to. I have so many regrets and I will never forget them! I am sorry that this happened to me and I don’t even know where to look anymore .|0
What to say about this movie ? A married couple has more then just each other . After playing around with it, I thought I would give the movie a look and see how it looked, but nothing has happened. I think I'm going to try and give it a try . I think it is probably the most amazing and the most entertaining movie I've been given. I have seen enough movies, and I like to watch them on my TV so I'm going to take a few and watch it right now in order to give my kids the best possible viewing.|0
Sci-Fi channel thinks this IS Sci-Fi ; it 's a shame . Big Bugs , Snakes , Mythical Beasties , and many others are trying to 'suck this shit , but that's still the way of the world ; it 's still a shit . You may just think that we should 've been as stupid or as stupid, but no one on this planet would 've got any clue who or what it is. If it wasn 't, we wouldn 've been as stupid, right? . . . Well, I think it's great news, that we can 't 'lieve it.|0
In Fassbinder 's earlier films , his ideas sometimes surpased his ability to execute them . He was always a man of his word. For the first few years after the premiere of Fassbinder in New York, the film had been released in Germany, Sweden, and Austria. In Austria he was working on a German film. The film became an official feature in the Bavarian cinema. He had been involved in a lot of film production in Germany, including a successful film at the Einsatzkommando in Ingolstadt (1922). At the Munich film festival a short-lived, unsuccessful German feature film was made in Finland and in Sweden.|0
"Are you kidding me ? This is quite possibly the worst , amateur movie I 've ever seen . The movie is so very bad that it's very hard to get my picture. So much of it is a parody , and no one wants to read anything that isn't ""real"" or ""expert."" I love the film , and have loved the acting, the acting, and the cinematography . It's hard to get your picture the right way, and just get the movie the right way for the best possible outcome ."|0
"I 'm having as much fun reading the user comments as I did watching the movie ! It seems that I've seen a lot of this type of thing before, but not much. I'm a little lazy, but this is really fun. Anyways, if someone can shed some light on this, I'd greatly appreciate it! :)
I hope this helps. If not, then I could probably do it in a different way, but there should be more information about that. Thanks. Hello! I am very glad that you enjoyed your time as an artist."|0
Two years after leaving the small town of Grover 's Bend due to encountering the Krites , Brad Brown returns from a year-long stint in the Middle East after he had been in Egypt for many years. In July, he was appointed to the East Africa Regional Commission (ERGAD) and the Middle East Executive Commission (MEEC), but was never appointed to any commission in the first place. As a result of being appointed in January, Brown had to complete a series of administrative tasks in the field of education, as well as the training of young people in the fields of Arabic literature.|0
I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. Based on a true story, this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film. Seriously, I couldn't find anything wrong with it. One definite plus is how it was filmed. Set in Morrocco in 1904, the Wind and the Lion is filled with stirring images like the Great Raisuli on horseback especially. The cinematography was faultless, the editing was crisp, the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking. And I have to mention the music from Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal.|1
I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.We were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long, it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy.|1
I picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a teenage girl, who, as I explained in the film’s review, is “sick enough” and “lame enough” in a way that it could have been written. It’s a great film but it is not the sort of film that would be appropriate for someone who finds it difficult to see, and who wants to tell it to others. A few weeks back I did some research to see what I thought I knew.|0
"One of the most successful shows in television history is back. Now I admit I never got into the original show.... Okay, so I never watched it at all. But the new show is impressive.Sci-Fi has premiered the first two episodes, ""Rose"" and ""The End of the World,"" this weekend. We meet Rose, a twenty-something clerk who is chased by remote controlled mannequins. She is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the Doctor. Using the Internet, she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the Doctor goes, death follows."|1
"There are movies that are leaders , and movies that are followers . `` Meatballs '' was a leader . There is a version of the script that says, "" the guy in front of you will be in charge of the movie."" "" is the one that really says, "" a guy who knows all the things in the script will do everything he has to do. "" You say that, and the movie looks a bit off the line and doesn't work as hard. It is a very strange script, but I would like to give a few suggestions."|0
Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu . I've had the privilege to be in some of these fights myself. I've seen a lot of this in the last few weeks or so but it's just that I really wanted to go back and watch Kung Fu and see what's new and what's gone on. I'd like to say a lot of people have the pleasure of watching it but there's one thing that I think is totally out there that has to be watched out.|0
"Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked! Now, her book ""Breaking Dawn"" will not be first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans.Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is medical student, Eve, who is assigned to interview psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist, and when she found out they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of it.She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared delusion going on. At times, she even acted like she had PTSD."|1
This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel ever to be devised. As a Pimpernel fan, I was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters--but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you aren't familiar with the story.Percy Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get down a hallway. Chauvelin would never have a string of women in his bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever the heck she is. Chauvelin would not randomly shoot Tony in the head.|1
"It isn't TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim... it's stupid.It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no ""Look at me Kimmy!"""|1
"This feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. The whole plot is extremely forced - especially the ""gallant"" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.But there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha! )The shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. And I liked Peter Hayes impressions of Charles Laughton and Ronald Coleman as well."|1
That 's a weird , weird movie and does n't deserve a better mark than David Lynch 's one ! I would say the movie is the most ridiculous and I don't really mind having to pay the price of it. Well, that's exactly what he's doing here. He's also the second director of that movie, and one of the three directors of the film that he's been making with his name and his name's a lot of names, so it doesn't make for a better film than Lynch.|0
This horror movie starts out promisingly enough and there is a moment where I thought to myself `` this is the way it should end. But the ending is very abrupt. There's not much more you can see that we're not supposed to see.'' If this is all true then it is time to see the other horror films. For the second time in the last year or so there have been a number of new horror films on the horizon. I have written about three of these films over the years. We have seen the first of these films here in the UK.|0
I find this film meretricious, tentative, lethargic, and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script, turn the camera on, and act a fool. I find the inauspiciously performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and whatever film school laws D' Urville Martin broke funny. Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This film looks like fun. When other aspiring film directors ask me advice I just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore.|1
"The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie I 've yet run across. Hercules is an adaptation of a book written by Robert C. Meyer, who went on to become the most prolific writer in the world, and whose works are now regarded as the finest works of fiction, history, and horror in the history of the 21st century. “The adventures of Hercules is a great way to go for a character and a director.”

Meyer was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Jewish family of Jewish immigrants who immigrated from Europe."|0
"I actually liked this movie even though this movie seems to be so hated and i think it 's even worse

I just saw this and it turned me on, when i watched it and read the article, i really liked this movie even if it's worse because it looks like something stupid is going on and that is why it looks like one of the most awful movies on the internet

One thing that i have noticed is that the movies in this video are all terrible and this is definitely one of the biggest reasons of why it's so bad."|0
Never , ever , have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of kids. It seems to have all sorts of potential and is a great idea. I'm sure the film should be made a lot better as a series but the concept is very strong and the music is good. A good example of why it's important to make a film, and why I love making the stuff you've made, is the music, which is used as an example to illustrate what it is to have such a strong sense of sound.|0
"Based on the comments made so far , everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . I hope this movie will be a little bit different for everyone but I cannot find it in my local theater . I am going to say this movie was not great. But yes, you can see the movie and see it for yourself , I hope it was different than others ,
I am sorry but I have never seen the movie . If you had been in the theater watching it, I think that you'd find it very amusing , even though the movie has the same visual style as it was."|0
The first time I saw this film I was a kid . I was ten years old when it was released and it was released and then I had no clue why it was released, but I was so excited to see it. In fact, I had seen it before and I liked it so I had to go and see it. That was the most important thing in my life. That was my greatest moment as an artist in those first few weeks. It was an emotional moment. I think it’s something that was just a part of that experience.|0
This is , for different reasons , a very very bad action movie . First of all , Seagal is very interesting as a hero , who is so in love with him , he will get the best results . Second of all , Seagal is an example , who is so extremely nice to his viewers . . . , he has just been a star and he is very funny , which is a huge advantage . . . He is very popular . He has been known to perform the most popular songs , and this is important for the fans .|0
"My mom and I went to the Ft Worth Premiere mainly to see George Strait , but ended up getting a few hours after he left. It was a couple of miles in, which was fine, because we were just out to get dinner from our dad's table. So I called my mom to make sure I got home, and it was pretty much a week later. So, she got me back home and took me to George Strait again. She was in the middle of a talk at the time. I asked her, ""How old are you?"|0
When this show began it was fairly interesting : we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through : after all it had been an experience for the longest time in the history of a small country and I had been told by a woman that what crab boat fisherman wanted was a good one : I really didn't care if I got to live and be able to catch fish. The crab boat fisherman was not only a true gentleman, but an experienced, skilled person in his own right, with an excellent sense of right and wrong, so it's very hard to complain about crab boat fisherman.|0
"Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's beyond funny. The ""plot"" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he's called a ""military adviser"" but it's not really clear if he's in the American military or not), helping the army of a Latin-American country fight guerrillas who winds up joining the guerrillas when the government turns on him, imprisons and tortures him. Shannon Tweed is a ""sports equipment saleswoman"" he picks up in a bar who gets caught up in all the intrigue."|1
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last night. The film was not quite as bad as most of its critics put it. So I think you're right to expect something a little stronger. If it were up to me, I'd be pissed. I hope you get the sense that we are going to have a strong debate with the audience, even if it seems to be overblown. It's a good movie, it has plenty to say.|0
"Imagine every stereotypical, overacted cliche from every movie and TV show set on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Populate it with a cast of interchangeable caricatures instead of actual characters. Throw in a mix of ""period"" music and wailing electric guitars during the ""rumble"" scenes. Then pass the time trying to figure out (or care) which of the Deuces is going to be killed in the (anti)climactic final rumble.I'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, kiddie musical, or Oscar-nomination vehicle."|1
"What I got was something better.Just like many movies I've commented on as of recently, I'd been looking forward to this one for a while. Especially after I saw one of Toshiaki Toyoda's other films, ""Blue Spring"" which is easily in my top 20 favorite films. I loved the trailer for ""9 Souls"", and I thought it sounded very good. I didn't hear anything bad about it. Now I know why.This movie starts up as sort of a comedy, then during the last half of the film, it quickly becomes something else."|1
the mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big, and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience.|1
This is my first Deepa Mehta film . I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its English translation . My first film in the Hindi remake was released in 2008 and is now being re-released on Blu-Ray in India. On October 26, 2014 I started working as a screenwriter/director on a film that I worked on during the past 15 years which I have been doing for over 10 years . During my tenure in the film industry I was a freelance writer . I worked on the screenwriter of the original Hindi film which I produced .|0
I saw this on the Accent Underground release with the short films. I found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired.I went to bed, and no kidding I had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, switched the TV back on, loaded the DVD and saw the rest of the movie.Well done Alex Frayne sir, you've managed to implant your film into this old, cynical movie goers head, and that takes doing.|1
First off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. The cast is like the saved by the bell reunion, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always; the military is useless. It would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie. Apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals, the marines and ninjas, who get it the worst.|1
"I can just picture how this movie came to be:""So how else can we screw up our careers?"" ""I know! Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!""Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place!"|1
Just what is the point of this film? It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it.|1
Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state of the art Russian sub with a nurse. This is to answer a call for help set off by a dying member of the original crew. The sub has been overtaken by terrorists who are bent on destruction. So we see the duo try and gain control back. And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleashing everything it has got on the terrorist sub to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful of the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the movie.|1
Robert Aldrich 's brutal , quasi-black comedy `` The Grissom Gang '' , a reworking of the 1948 British film version of the same name in the form of the film version, was published in 1971, and the film's name has remained on many of its websites since then. Although Aldrich 's work has also appeared as a title in the UK television series ''The Last Star,'' and in the television series ''The Great Gatsby,'' both ''The Great Gatsby'' (1971) and ''The Great Gatsby'' (1972) are both produced in the United Kingdom.|0
Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel , combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés. You're the real star of this movie. It's so sexy, so sexy, that it’s actually a perfect film, a movie that you want to see as a whole. And it will be. The only real movie to come out this year, as it is the only thing that should come out. This is just the kind of movie that should be a part of your heart.|0
"Before I saw this movie I believed there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) Your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e. ""Constantine""), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it's good (a la ""Manos The Hands of Fate""). Now that I've seen ""Dr. Gore"" I know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich. That will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A work that is mind-bendingly execrable."|1
This is a piece of cinematic beauty , and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other piece of film. In this chapter, I will describe the films from which they originated. The film's main characters and plot are all Quebec. This is not one to be skipped, however, so it is possible that there is a parallel between some of the films in this series of films. There are of course countless other films produced outside Quebec, though, and it would be wise to avoid these.|0
Dictated by thin experience ( of both life and industry ) and no cash Sofia Coppola 's early short is to be read as 'soul-centric'. 'Life' has to be seen in an emotional context, to be read as 'life-oriented.' 'Industry' should be seen in an emotional sense. In short, you have to take your chances, take chances, take chances and take chances. Life does not mean you 'do' it. Life has to be viewed as 'human-centric' (i.e., you do not need to be human) but that will change and you have to accept that 'life-centric' is true.|0
I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new, fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more...).The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier.|1
This movie is so bad , they would n't buy it back at my local used CD/DVD store . I've only heard of it online and have only ever played it myself. I don't know if there's much of anything there ,but you should read this link ,it should help you understand why it was such a disappointment to me. It sounds very bad ,it would have been great if it had come back. I do like how it was played as well but you don't know what I mean. You can see how the song sounds and how the lyrics sounds.|0
Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots , yes Camp Blood ( or if you want to call a Camp Blood) is one of the most fun things i can do and that was it was a little bit fun but i don’t think you have to have a gun but you do need one and if you are planning to kill a friend then you need to use your own gun for that purpose. This is just an example, if you want to use your gun and if you have a gun, you need to have your gun.|0
This was my late wife 's favorite film . I 'm sorry she did not live long enough to have time to talk about this , but i really enjoyed reading it ,and i 'm also so glad the movie came out and we were so much better than what she had. It is a shame the film was released and i want to make a new one to read. It was an incredible film, and the story is true and well written, but it was a long-shot, so to make the film we need to make a sequel to the movie .|0
"This film is a nightmare! The sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same I got when I finished watching this movie: ""UffOK, it ended, what a relief!"" I felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! It's a B-series low cost movie, that's for sure, but I think it not an excuse to be so bad! I've watched brilliant low cost movies, with nice plots, nice production, nice acting, and most of all, some substance! This one got nothing of it!"|1
This film proves a theory I have had for quite some time - in Australia , as long as a lot of people are getting the idea that there are limits to the ability of many people to make sense of what a movie is about. So in order to get an understanding of what's driving this idea, one has to know how much money it takes and how much time it takes to build it into reality. So I've spent about 10 years doing that research and now I'm trying to put that research out there and create some reality for people to understand.|0
This is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s . Otto Preminger directed only four or five really awesome films for this year. The first time I saw him I thought he was just one of those old movies. He’s pretty good in all respects – I’ll say it about time. I’ll never look back. The second time I got to watch a film that was made after the film and was not released for many years, I was hooked when I got the picture and it was great and I was able to do a lot of things with it.|0
This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. And of course us Americans just have to remake everything successful into English, because man reading subtitles is SOOOOO Hard isn't it! From what I've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant Jessica Alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) It looks EXACTLY the same but probably w/double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks I have seen in any language in quite a long while.|1
Distributor: GOODTIMES home video Plot: A pretty high school student is marked for unrelenting terror in this suspense filled made for TV movie. Gail Osborne is new in town. She makes friends, has a boyfriend and everything seems to be going her way. That is until she gets an ominous and frightening phone call while babysitting. After more and more phone calls, she is raped. throughout most of the movie, she tries to find proof that the person did rape her.Audio/Video: This 1987 VHS edition from Goodtimes stinks.|1
This is no walk in the park. I saw this when it came out, and haven't had the guts to watch it again. You will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie. I felt like I'd been severely beaten. What kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-ME-WE are not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, to shake us to our very core, and he succeeded.|1
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there's no real pacing or tension in the story.|1
"I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.WHAT ? ? ? ""I'm just watching this today and I have no idea what you have written about me...I just wanted to know if I did or did not. That is, how did you think I knew your story? How did I get to know you...how do you think I did...what happened?"" I have never met a person I don't want to look at, or know someone who doesn't. This is the type of story I'm reading now."|0
'Helen of Troy ' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan War . This is more a story about the lives of two young women who had been caught in the action of the Trojan War and were sent as mercenaries to Troy for avenge for the loss of their lives. She is the author of the book 'Helen of Troy ', the first novel in the series of anthologies from the German Library, The German Anthology and The German Anthology series. This story is about two young men who fought for avenge for a friend who was killed in the action of a Trojan War.|0
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I could have stopped there and gone on with my life. She does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.I also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. If a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, I would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig.|1
Well , I fear that my review of this special wo n't heed much different observation than the others before me. 1. If I understand your point above, I'm not surprised if I find you in this review. But for some reason I think I may have an opinion that this review is no better than I. But I'm also wondering if you had any questions in that review. Or if you have any of the other reviews on this site? Or if you have had any feedback from others on this site? Or are you just a little more confused than the others?|0
What a shocker . For starters , I could n't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time as if it was the only thing that brought me to my office . For my job , I was not a good employee. And I wouldn't let anything else come my way. But I do have the ability to get out of this one and into the office. And I do need to talk to one another for a few minutes every day as the day goes on . To be honest , I think it took a couple of months for me to get over it .|0
I 've read the positive comments on this movie . I assume people who were in this movie must 've read this movie and agree with it. If you don't have a subscription please click here . Dangerous, I've read the negative comments here and have read and agree the movie. I know it may sound a little strange to you if you don't like the plot, but this movie is so very well written and so beautifully written. I would really like to see the film in a more positive tone, even if it turns out the author was a bad person.|0
Any fan of Russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by Mashkov and Bodrov Jr., and will perhaps be utterly perplexed by Bodrov Sr.'s hackneyed and confusing script, which is coupled with uncharacteristically weak direction. Most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced one iota since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her screen exposure is mercifully limited.|1
Okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an MST3K flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *SPOILER ALERT* The film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named Danny meets a bum named Bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (who is so very.) Now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough.|1
Watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there.Let me say , most of the other reviews I’ve found have been pretty similar. That is because I don’t think the story gets any more interesting as I get older. If you want to get older you need to write the story better. The older story is better as I write the story a bit better. I guess I just want the older story to be the old story so I could write the story better. But I don’t.|0
As I write this in November 2005 I 've become aware that the great British boom of cinema has come to a halt, and as such we have not yet seen cinema for the entire British Isles – not even at the very best of times (at least in Britain), and I hope that will be the case as I take a few days to write this piece, but in the next several months, I will be writing about the cinema as a whole, and I hope that some of you will get the chance to meet me.|0
Actually I'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was too bad in my opinion. Not very likely that Antonie Kamerling will get a Rutger Hauer status. Some folks will expect it anyway. First let him work on his English pronunciation. If you watch the 'trip' to Paris of these actors (DVD-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there... To the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please.|1
I went to this film having no idea what to expect . I actually took a date to it in about 3 days. I am really not too thrilled about it either. It's one of the reasons that I want this film to be as good as possible so that people can have fun making it. But I'm not too enthusiastic about it any more. It's kind of like trying to get the best shot at the most realistic movie I can find. What I want to know is what exactly did you expect when you started watching this movie?|0
This telecast of the classic musical `` Sweeney Todd '' does not do the production justice , but is still a little bit more fun and accessible than it was last season. I found it to be one of my most favorite shows this season. `` Sweeney Todd '' is a modern musical about the power struggle between two powerful individuals. It also has a modern cast, with characters that have never existed before. It is a comedy-dance show with lots of action and lots of scares, a little bit of mystery, and it has a very interesting style.|0
This is precious . Everything Is Illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue . To read the whole thing here , please click here . This is absolutely delicious . It's not just that it's delicious , the whole thing is delicious, but the real fun is in the line where the dialogue starts . The whole thing is beautiful . I know the dialogue is very well paced . But it's not too bad, just a bit dull. The dialogue itself is quite funny and I'll be surprised by the quality of the dialogues .|0
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect. Unlike virtually any other film I can name, I never watch this film and think it would have been better if they'd changed this or that or whatever. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every brushstroke in Mishima is perfect and it all flows from the Schrader's script. I've always sort of liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film), but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic, his directing style is usually non-existent.|1
Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton, his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes), a good script and perfect casting really puts this across.|1
I go this game and it is alright I guess. I just expected a bit more. The main problem with this is that the hacking is extremely hard, even if you read the instructions you can't get it. Also the graphics aren't as good as Pandora Tomorrow and Double Agent. This game could do with some improvements, it says that if guards are waling in water and you shoot a sticky shocker in the water the guard will fry up but nothing happens. In my opinion this is the worst out of the three.|1
Are sea side resorts the sad , dreary places they 're always depicted as in movies and novels ? Certainly there are those who would go to the top of the cliff, and get lost in the depths of the sea. No, they may go somewhere else for a drink or two. It is not that there are none. It is because they are the most likely places to be found in the very same place where we live. But you have to be very careful and make sure there are no other possibilities.|0
"I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.Shame on India for not sending this movie as a result. I don’t know why people would give it away.I was very sad to hear that the movie was cancelled because of its content.I really hope that we will all have a good time and that it is better than the other movie I saw in India. I hope I can have a good time in India.Thank you

If we want to improve the movie, I am going to ask that it will come back to the screen. Thank you for visiting the website."|0
I hope this is n't a portent of things to come . High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time, and many cameras don't offer a decent-looking flash for high-resolution photos, so you can't use them without buying a pair of good quality camcorders , and the price of the camcorders are usually around 50-55 dollars per camera, which isn't a great deal of money, nor do they save you a lot of money. Here's a look at a couple of things that are great for high-density cameras, though they aren't perfect for high-format or high-quality images.|0
I loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed John Cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. But the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. They really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! Derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..Rogers also looks very strange. I also don't understand where Rothbart came from.|1
I think `` Rosemary 's Baby '' is the most overrated horror film out there . Not scary , interesting , funny , or anything at all , and I believe that if you put a picture of a newborn girl in it you can make it scary and you get a lot of 'em. It is very, very real, but you will also need to make sure you are realistic. It is possible to take the time to make this kind of film and then write down what happened. The first thing to do is make a good film and have the characters in the picture in the first frame.|0
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing . All the acting was very well done and the story and writing was good and I couldn't help but go into more of the other things, I had a great time with the characters but I had some trouble with the writing and it was tough . I would recommend this movie to friends and family . I want to spend my time watching it again now . I loved the story and characters and it made me want to watch more . I would recommend this movie . I highly recommend to all fans and people .|0
"I honestly do n't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review , as a result of all I've tried , when I was trying to use them , but its not my case

I don't know why it is happening, and I'm not sure why it should be the same for people using it. I have used them for about 3 years and I've used them for over 2.5 years. So, I had this question a while back and found it to be a really easy one to answer, so here is my idea of what I'm talking about."|0
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing , but I just found it annoying . It 's like if you were to pay a little bit less to watch a scene, then the viewer would never be interested in what is said and what it is about the story, rather than how the film actually works, the way the characters are portrayed in the movie. It just seems that in many ways this is one of the many things the film was never intended to appeal to. Anyway, it's not about a movie.|0
Christopher Nolan 's directorial debut is a memorable one . The film was very well received and help land contracts for a long time. There have been three successful projects of Nolan's and it is a great film, with a wide variety of roles, which makes it a unique one, which should give a strong sense of what the character truly needs. There have also been a number of other projects of Nolan which have received great success. There have been some which have made it onto DVD/Blu-ray and it's a very good movie and I think it is one that I think I would recommend to others.|0
OK - say some college in southern California has an movie making class. And some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. AND FAILED.That is my only explanation for this, this, thing. Good God they left the date and time counter on during some of it. The picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot.|1
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot . It was very watchable and very funny . And I've always liked this movie. It's one of my favourite films of the last 20 or 25 years . You never know which will be funny. I'm sure I'm going to miss it, too . But I do think, if we could get to see it more clearly in the future , then I can do the same for the future. It would be amazing to watch it today . It would make you think of how we've made the world so beautiful .|0
"""Landscape after a battle"" opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences - in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob, and when they (also treated humouristic) burry a man alive, the protagonist stops for a moment, but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released, in some kind of semi freedom, semi camp."|1
"I loved the film ""Eddie Monroe"". The film had all the components that kept me interested while watching it. I especially loved the plot twists along the way and the surprising ending. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt potential both in looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman's. Fred Carpenter took this movie to a new level.I loved the cast. The music score, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and gifted director."|1
"(Contains spoilers)People who put a Lonely Heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope...Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo), owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the ""Mississippi"", but - Catherine Deneuve."|1
I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. So, because of this it's natural that I'd choose this film--especially because with John Agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. Sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. At least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting.|1
"Hearkening back to those `` Good Old Days '' of 1971 , we can vividly recall when we were treated to some of those memorable ``good old days,'' as in the following excerpt :

So many of you in the audience have forgotten how to tell a good day, a good hour, a great night, a bad day. It can be hard to tell a good day when the world is in a bad place. What I would try to do to improve the world is to put in a good head to head attitude, to show that the good day goes well."|0
This is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on TV. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally could watch them over and over. Anyone who does not find this show hilarious, heartwarming, entertaining, and laugh out loud hysterical, is crazy! Kevin James is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there. My boyfriend and I love going to stand up comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James twice and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) once. They are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work.|1
"From the beginning of this film,with it's ""The Lost boys"" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. ""The Covenant"" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who I am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that."|1
if u have n't seen Vijay in `` Ghillli '' , `` Gilly '' or `` Ghillie '' . go through the list of possible words for Vijay, and then search the list of possible words for Gilly. The list for Gilly is in the list of available words, and so you will not see a word in the list. **3. ** The list of possible words for Vijay, Ghillie, Gilly, and Vijay-gill, as in Gilly, is very important. The lists of the two Hindi versions are quite similar; however, we will talk about them at some length.|0
"I was so `` impressed '' with Tim Kincaid 's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this one a try . . . and I didn't like it at all! . . . I'm just going to make it as good as it gets! I'm going to make it so much faster and I've been playing around for a long time now . . . ' **TIM KICLERAY, THE CHIEF'S BEST CHANCE**

The last time I saw him play at the Centre he said, "" 'We're only playing to make the game better."|0
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier . It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas as well as the movies about people who do things that are often too much like Hollywood movies. It’s true, it’s just a bit hard to imagine that we’ll get anywhere close to it, and while I’m pretty sure the Oscar ceremony itself is going to do that, I really don’t have a lot of confidence in the film, so I’d have to give it a little more time.|0
I suppose I 'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt . These laboratory movies (not to be confused with movies that have already been shown) are shown in the left, right. (Side Note) There are a few scenes in which this movie takes place, in which they are shown in the left side . I am guessing that that happens because they were previously shown in a different way than this one . If that is the reason why this film takes place, I'm not sure I will see it again.|0
After just viewing the movie, I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This takes my worst movie award away from Komodo, which is no easy feat. It is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. The acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was a joke such as this put in the film?|1
I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely. It's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never really seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really did figure that out.) Jones was OK in his role, although I thought he was really starting to show his age here.|1
I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really, really wish I had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down.The score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh.|1
I was very disappointed in this film. The director has shown some talent in his other endeavors, but this just seemed to be filler. There may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.I would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. As I watched it, I kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. At the end of the movie I was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way.|1
The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice scenery. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is a definite Hollywood prop. There is no definite storyline. It goes from Venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies.|1
I caught this movie late night on TV , and was expecting a low-budget campy `` masterpiece '' , I can't tell you how grateful I was that I could watch it, and couldn't have been happier that this movie was real, and I could not have waited to watch it. But this was my first film, so I am hoping that when I got to know this movie I could tell more about the film than I did the first film. This film was set in 1990 and was shot in the USA.|0
This review contains spoilers.I was searching through horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of Snakes On A Plane, but it was selling brand new for 69p so I figured I didn't really have much to lose.The music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although I did like the song itself a pop-rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie.|1
`` Out to Sea '' is a fun movie starring that wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau . . . they both share a love of the movie and a very close friendship . . . he is a real genius in his profession . . . the world of Hollywood has been so turned around since the beginning of time that many have thought that it is not possible to write a movie with an audience of just a few thousand . . . it is always possible for such a person to make a movie even though it is still a work of art . .|0
"i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie . i 've never grown tired of seeing it, so maybe i could make it more interesting . thanks. I was just looking at the youtube video for the first few seconds but there was a couple of minutes of the video that i forgot to try and understand. The first few seconds seem to take a lot longer. I was really curious to see how it turned out. Here is a video of the film:

A couple of seconds later the camera goes silent."|0
In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans, in the beginning of the Twentieth Century, the Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed Mohammed el-Raisuli the Magnificent (Sean Connery) kidnaps the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get some money and rifles as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan of Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, the American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from the prison with the American soldiers.|1
A total and absolute waste of time . Bad acting . Bad story . Predictable . Simple . Pathetic . This is a book that’s always been in the limelight so I can only hope I’m wrong . In this new series, you will get to read the very latest version of this amazing story, and learn about the many facets of human existence in the Middle East. I’ll share some details, including a quick breakdown, about my experience, and the impact of the events of the past two weeks. What’s next for the Middle East series?|0
This film makes several nods to various science fiction films. The prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of THX-1138 (the trailer for BUCK ROGERS, here it was clips from some early Japanese SF TV show). Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard, reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes evenmore pronounced when we meet the hero, who is called a Replicant (He is blond haired and is called Ryo, a homage to Roy Batty, Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?).|1
"It's hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. Bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys. He was quietly moving in the TV movie ""Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus"" and showed a lot of class and style in the Sean Penn-directed ""The Indian Runner"".In ""The Evil That Men Do"", however, Bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists, knives and, of course, guns."|1
This was a excellent movie. I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was more than word can explain. I also purchased the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my son's teachers watch it also.I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where I could purchase it. Thank You, Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children/adults with special ability's.|1
At the time of this writing (January 25, 2006), I am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of Chris Penn. Other than Footloose, The Wild Life is the film that I remember Chris most from.I still remember in the film, with slight fondness, of Chris' wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup.Anyhow, my comment is in regards to the title track sung by Bananarama.|1
"* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * There 's not much that can be said of the idea that there are two things we have to think of right now, two different kinds of games we play. So there 's nothing that makes sense. That's not quite clear, but when you say it's ""two different kinds of games,"" that's probably a good way to think. Here are the two things I think about the first, the idea that there are two ways to play them."|0
I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Roberts' story. Not having read the book, I don't know if this adaptation was faithful but I do know it wasn't good. Actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to Nora Roberts.I planned ahead and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I've never been sure if she's a good actress. She's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. But, Forlani wasn't alone.|1
I did have a good time the first 45 min . or so , but then suddenly it was all over! There is a bit of a split second but I found this to be true.

If you have any questions, or would like me to be able to answer them, or have any feedback, feel free to PM me on [email protected] Please do not contact me directly, but feel free to ask a question with an answer that you feel is important to you.|0
The other reviewer was completely correct about this one. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. The actors looked like they were not really into the movie, like they almost *had* to be there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really germane to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. I suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can I say that?) of the other eschatologically influenced movies (Omega Code, Left Behind).|1
I saw this at the BendFilm Festival Friday amid an unsettled crowd of people , not helped by a poor festival ticket. I knew that I was going to have to go back later in the week or I would miss the chance to see some very good film and see the film again at the Bend Film Festival, but it’s been so long that I don’t even know how to get back to BendFilm. I’ve always been on the fence about which films I should go to because it’s been such an emotional roller coaster.|0
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.Our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but I cannot figure out where that came from. His co-workers find out and tease him terribly.During the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls.|1
I must admit I wasn't expecting much on this movie. I was surprised I truly enjoyed it as much as I did. The script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either. The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever. What made this movie for me was the music. If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie. Its all about being a rockstar. Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.|1
"I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me, no one knows it because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters, I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these ""professionals"" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it needs to be."|1
... and I 'm so disappointed because I ca n't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.Its the kind of thing that I just hate. It is a pretty expensive DVD, but it costs $10 to $19.99. If you can pay $50 and the price comes down to about $10 a month, you can buy the VHS and still have some of the features you needed. Also, I can't get the DVD to come with a screen, can't I get the DVD, and if you can buy a screen, then it is not even worth it.|0
This is a very modest, very lovely movie with a great score by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser with a standout number, We're The Couple In The Castle, that is totally evocative of the period and harks back to Penthouse Serenade just as the opening premise (Hoppity's coming) may well have inspired Fred Saidy and Yip Harburg's opening (Woody's Coming) in Finian's Rainbow six years later. I totally agree with those posters who have noted that were the name Disney appended to this it would by now have achieved 'classic' status rather than have fallen into neglect.|1
I was never in the past interested in this play although love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays in some form. The reason for it being that I was interested is that my father made up his play to make my interest into a professional. I was born in New York but I came to England in 1844. It is a story I read to myself as a middle-aged child in the summer of 1845 when I was about 8 or 9. There I read an article about a play I saw at an assembly line.|0
Firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of Kung Fu starring Gordon Liu. I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater presents DVD has a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention (no idea why) The Young Hero starring Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after, the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style.|1
Everything about this movie is awful.You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be a mess and you can't help but to think you will never get to see him again, so I'm going to pretend this is my first time seeing him again and I just don't think it's important to mention it as it doesn't look as good as it should be but I'm not doing that.The dialogue is great but it's hard to describe and at times I don't get it.|0
Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumour, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was introduced in 1944 in Jean Negulesco's 'The Mask of Dimitrios', where he played Dimitrios. The next year, 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. He is best remembered by cineastes as the star of Jean Renoir's 'The Southerner', one of the 1945 films, where he had a sympathetic role. However, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money.|1
I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there . Very disappointing that it looks like this. I watched this video because I liked Malta, it looks amazing, it’s just a really fun movie. This movie’s good, it looks really fun and there’s just so many things that I like. I’m a big fan of movies, this one’s really good too. It’s just so many things. It’s the best movie you’ve seen.|0
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from what I've heard. But I didn't expect it to take that long to come to my screen because I don't remember if it was any quicker or not. But it did take it so long that it wouldn't last longer. I had to figure this out myself. I've spent the last few weeks working on a movie that I've never really liked, so I can't blame it on any of that.|0
Great subject matter , director , and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film , told in that interview. I don't know if you saw this film, but it is a beautiful piece of work and it gives a strong sense of purpose for this film. When we were talking about this film, it was quite clear that we had been working with some of the directors for years, so I had a feeling that if there was a chance of doing a story where they didn’t really do everything together, there was no way of getting a story in there.|0
Cute Movie feel good movie I had never heard of this movie but ran across it while looking for something to rent. I had high hopes for this movie based purely on Flex being in this movie. I have never seen him in anything not worth while. True to form this movie delivered for me. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I really liked this movie a lot. I didn't give it five stars because it did not discuss certain issues that I thought the movie should have detailed.|1
i was flipping through the channels and had to stop and laugh when i came across this movie . It was actually pretty great! My husband is going crazy on it and it has a very funny story. I know that the movie is pretty terrible and i do not have the patience to look after it. When I see a movie i am like me. It is pretty funny. This is not the best movie i have ever watched. But, i think that there is something that makes you want to read and watch it again so i will try my best to find the movie you like best.|0
I have just seen Today You Die. It is bad, almost very bad.1) The direction and editing are awful, just awful. Almost made me turn off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to be filming things at random and some scenes don't make sense at all. Also, I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad.2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful.|1
MGM hodgepodge of Jimmy Durante throwing a big party for everybody in Hollywood . No major stars show up -- except a guy who was trying to kill himself on TV for the day, and is now calling it a night. I think he has been the target since the beginning, and it would be unfair to say he hasn't seen it. I doubt he even has a chance of seeing it for the time being, but whatever happens he can keep his fingers crossed that it can happen again if he gets it right the night he wakes up and goes straight to work.|0
Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that, the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story.|1
What has Rajiv Rai done to himself? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. I was initially excited at the thought of Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should at least give it a go but I left after an hour. One reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of Paki- bashing in the film, this was not in Rai's previous venture.A lot of directors have tried Paki- bashing but I did not expect it from Rajiv Rai Another letdown was the music.|1
"For those viewers who thought the 1979 film ""Alien"" the first to depict a male Earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, ""Night of the Blood Beast,"" made 21 years earlier, may come as something of a surprise. In this film, America's first man in space crashlands back on Earth and, after examination, is thought to be dead. He later comes to again, only with a half dozen or so alien seahorse thingies growing in his abdomen. The mama (?) alien also pops up to terrify the small band of scientists who are observing our gravid hero, and she (?)"|1
"Can't liberals like Alec Baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004? The ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart, non-union workers, George W Bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen. As the credits roll the sour grapes continue as ""Special Thanks"" are given to Ken Lay, and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and IMClone. Let me clue you in to something - if you put all your money into one company's stock YOU'RE AN IDIOT."|1
"Audrey , I know you truly cherish your husband Ted 's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed the call of the law!"" ""It's a shame Ted's still alive, but I'm glad that I'm being a part of their legacy.""

"A bit ""the movie in the movie"" case, or as the theme is virtual game here, which is the reality or even more frightening which reality is the ""real"" one.As any Cronenberg there are organic things, like the pod and that wonderful idea:the organic gun, a weapon made of bones and tissues that shoots teeth. If there are some slower moments, the sets, designs and ideas are there with some thoughts of revolution. Can be not liked because the way the movie is happening is quite unusual and sometimes disturbing, but it's definitely worth it."|1
The title role of this western is played by Robert Walker , Jr . He 's a young gun who is one of the most gifted players in the American football draft, and one of the top defensive tackles in NFL history . Walker is the head coach of the San Francisco Giants . He also plays for the Indianapolis Colts, Baltimore Ravens and New York Giants . This is also his first year at the position . What a great story. We're happy to say that Scott Brown has a chance to become an NFL Pro Bowl-caliber defender, even if he has no plans.|0
"What a mess--and I'm not referring to the ""destruction"" in the title. I could go on about the hackneyed plot, the lousy effects, the (actually notable) cast grimacing as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'll just say there weren't any palm trees in Chicago the last time I checked, and leave it at that.Hmmm...need ten lines to get this posted on IMDb.. OK, well, I think a DVD release with outtakes could be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing."|1
I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. We have seen this type of movie I don't know how many times.Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer.|1
"Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking -- and is thought by the local folk to be the soul of good. This blog is a way of learning about God and the soul of the mountain woman. If you would like to comment, and I would be very grateful for your time, or any feedback. Monday, March 10, 2011

As I had previously stated, I am a small girl, but I'm not big. I've been a mom, a teacher, a grandmother and a mom. I've been raised on my own."|0
Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel, combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clichés. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learn offhandedly she was involved in running over some guy with her car), facing hard time in the Big House with some of the nastiest characters this side of a Russ Meyer pic. Blair is continually pawed at, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is four-letter-word disgusting throughout, and the flick offers no let-up from its barrage of violence and stupidity.|1
I just viewed Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed . The story was easily paced as the plot unraveled. There are some things in this series that are going to help you out, but it is important to keep in mind that I have not yet written the book. I am not sure if I will get back to you much soon. I did not write the book until I finished my new book, but now that I am starting out, I hope to have a more complete book out that I may put into print before I get a chance to write another book.|0
It 's the Sooooouullltakaaaa ! Wow . What a skin peeling bad movie . Honestly , this is one of the most action-packed movie I have seen yet , I will have to keep watching it to learn more about it , so thanks for commenting . -I don't really have time to check the movie. It was pretty good, and it was so much fun. I will be waiting a long time to see the actual film, and hopefully I will not be too busy with it all at the same time. But I think I will.|0
Except for the glossy look, this show had little to recommend it. The writing was patronizing and convoluted. Without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters came off the worst... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos, and try to bag a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note.|1
We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back . Knowing it was an important feature to be included, and that VHS was a great platform to work with, I would highly recommend it and look forward to it for years to come. One of my favourite scenes in VHS was on the bridge of the ship 'Celestial' at the time, I was really enjoying the scenery with the bridge on it, especially the bridge at the bottom of the ship. It reminded me so much of an old movie, I will always cherish it.|0
Definition of documentary: A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration. The key word here is informative. I love They Might Be Giants, and barely learned a thing about them.The interviews with all the celebrities were pretty much worthless. I don't care what Sarah Vowel thinks of anybody and Syd Straw was downright irritating. And is listening to people recite TMBG lyrics like they were supposed to be funny/interesting? It was neither.|1
They call this film `` euro trash horror '' . Well , it 's not horror . The film takes its title to an entirely different thing. This is true, of course . It doesn 't scream horror . It doesn 't just scream horror .. It is also true of the film '' . The film is not a movie . The filmmakers use the word `` horror, '' they use it, '' they say , '' they call this film '' . They call this kind of movie '' . If that's the case, then the filmmakers think it has nothing to do with the actual film.|0
I like Arnold, and I love the subject matter, but this was a very disappointing movie. When I first saw the previews, they were dark and ominous, and Arnold's name wasn't even mentioned. But I recognized him, which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious, suspenseful mood. That it wasn't just another Schwarzenegger action vehicle (though I admit, most of his are pretty good!). He had, thus far, avoided movies with any real religious theme. And I was excited.|1
I appreciate the effort that the filmmakers wanted to depict the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers to put themselves into Moses' shoes and gain understanding of the intense burden laid upon Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to see this film, I was greatly disappointed in the storyline. (I'll leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this movie and how it is so far from the historical accounts from Biblical texts.|1
"This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first ""real"" L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip, whom he's never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam, but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting."|1
Yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn't take anything away from the film's charm and wonder. It was shown as part of our town's youth film festival and was the organising committee's favourite. Which is not surprising. The subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings.|1
"Rachel and Chuck Yoman ( Valerie Harper , Gerald McRaney ) , decided the city is too busy and dangerous for them to do anything to stop them from building a road. They built the new road. In January 2015 the mayor of Vancouver was asked to address the city council:

“Our mayor has done everything possible for them to protect their city.”

They had to. And now they are asking for a change of heart to the city council in the next few weeks. This is because they are being asked to build a road."|0
Animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short feature is dripping with Canadian references, and so, this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians most of all. But the basic story is universal, and it is told lovingly by writer Roch Carrier. It is a hilarious story that I have known for quite sometime, and I was recently fortunate enough to see it again, so I simply HAD to write a hearty recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece, and a must-see whether or not you are Canadian.|1
I remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out . They showed clips every single day, they're so funny and crazy. The only difference is that when it comes out, you don't feel like you actually care about it. So you just like them and they have no reason to care or do anything about it. Because you don't know how good it is, how funny it is or how funny it is...you're not going to get it anyhow. They have no way of knowing it or knowing you care.|0
Wow, I was really disappointed. I wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater, and I wish I stuck to that plan. It really should be a made-for-tv movie. I was kind of excited to see it, as I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do her justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. What a horrible cover up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. There was no flow to the movie, it was very hard to get into it.|1
Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios . Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio , obviously with the same credentials , and has no idea why he is being interviewed at this venue. However, after some initial inquiries it turns out there is no way to verify their authenticity . They are, after all, given only one reason to be interviewing him (that he was not interviewed). However, he's now admitted it's his personal reasons for being in that venue. He has now admitted that the reason he is interviewed is simply to get a better shot.|0
it's hard to make a negative statement here after all this raving about how great deed poll is, how wonderful the actors did and so on and so on. i did not like the film. it's crappy!there are orgies, they have taboo sex (gay sex, bi sex, oral sex, rape, anal sex, masturbation, brother-sister-sex, brother-brother-sex, sex on drugs, sex without drugs, sex, sex, sex seems to rule their world. i guess the director is desperately in need of a getting laid.) the story is just dirty and shameful.|1
"For once a sequel to ""The Karate Kid"" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank did an excellent job playing the orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one who plays Mr. Miyagi worked his way with Julie quite different from Daniel. Both Daniel and Julie favored karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most surly person Miyagi ever challenged. And there was no tournament to compete in. And there's gonna be some humor in this movie as well. I liked the part where when Julie came home from school, Miyagi went to check on her, and saw her change clothes in the process."|1
I know that Guts of a Beauty and Guts of a Virgin are crap films and are hated by many fans but there are a few things that they can do well and do well when they see them, they are well written, they are funny, they are well executed, they are well written and they are hilarious. All of these features are available for pre-orders, so don't miss out on these movies until you see them, they are fantastic to watch. I really hope that you enjoy them and would love some of the new features.|0
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom, She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer.|1
"Yahoo Serious is like a $3 bottle of wine - had no substance to begin with and just gets worse with age. This film proves he is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his final film and that its serious lack of success will diminish his chances of obtaining finance for any future ventures. It is right up there with ""Lightning Jack"" and ""Les Patterson Saves the World"" as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic it is that with so many infinitely superior comedic talents in Australia Yahoo is given such vehicles to express his brand of puerile school yard comedy."|1
This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers , if garbage could ruin motion picture careers. If you’ve watched any of those movies, this one will probably be your first. It may have saved you the most career-wrecking movie ever made , and will probably make your first few films. And I have to warn you, this is the type of movie that can ruin any career in the near future . It’s one of the most fun movies we’re going to watch this summer in the United States , so there’s no point worrying about it.|0
Six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing . Now , eighteen years later, the man who had been in prison and who is believed by many to be the son of an American rabbi and the grandson of a Polish rabbi who was hanged, is dead. He is the most beloved of them all, the most hated of them all, the most loved of them all. He is not even the least beloved of them; he is the most hated of them all as far as they are concerned.|0
"Low budget , but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar Frankenstein story-line

After reading this past weekend I thought I’d take some time to write this review. This time around I want to give a little intro, to show that you can actually read a lot more than I have in the last decade, and I know you’ll like that. I don’t remember what I thought about the book at the time, but for the time being it was good."|0
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my all-time favorites. I also remember seeing it a couple years ago. I was really excited when it got to the end of the year. I got to see what was going to get into the movie. I was able to get my first look at it after watching the movie a couple years ago. I found myself on the other side of the world when I watched the movie last year. I didn't have the time to really talk about it in depth.|0
This movie is Hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another ? GIANT cgi versions of these two beasts are a great movie so it should be easy to get bored of it. The main point of the movie is the destruction of an object in order to turn it into a creature. In order to do this, it is not only possible for the target creature to take the objects that the target uses. There is a large number of objects on the screen that can turn into creatures. In order to find these objects, the creature must have the means to do this.|0
I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.We saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. It was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive.|1
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre . Vulnerable , naive nurse Charlotte Beale, who will go on to serve as a major voice of the world of theatre and opera , will also appear. The film was made in 1993. It was the highest theatrical award for drama of the year and went to Best Picture of the year. It was also nominated for seven Academy Award, Best Supporting Actor in a Musical, Best Screenplay, Best Screenplay for an Improvisation , Best Actor in a Musical or a Drama Musical.|0
"What a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the IMDb scale as I write this. Folks, this is a lot closer to a 3.0, I'll even go out on a limb and say 4.0 where I've put it. Come on - how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphic cell structures, and not give it at least a 4.0 for creativity? Then you've got all that great dialog like - ""Dave, look at the composition of this mud."""|1
A savage, undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell, then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it. At first he thinks Bugs Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground, there he meets with Bugs, his next trainer. If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on, you should watch this cartoon.|1
In the twilight years of his career , Charles Bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors , most notably J. Robert Oppenheimer , as well as co-starring with David Mitchell. In the middle of his career, he and his team of co-stars, Richard Corbett and Pauline Teschner, had split up to work on a movie-comedy television series. They soon formed a successful partnership. But Bronson was a reluctant collaborator. “We did not like each other so we did not go back and find out if we would work together for something similar,” he told me.|0
There 's a good running bit about the price tag of a silk negligee . The bimbo in the office will be made out of $2.75 and I'm sure you've seen what they're offering on the web . What's next? I've also got a few suggestions of what could be a better way to use it . I'll be keeping it a secret because you probably can't resist the chance to use. Oh yeah, you could also use a little more polish, but that would probably take some work and you might want to add some colors.|0
I don't even know where to start. I did not like it. It did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) the murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for Linda aka Penelope to exist) that was never explained. It was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor.Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a five second cameo? Why did Diane Wiest use her Bullets over Broadway character without the camp-fun?|1
"This film easily rivals the emotional strength, the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of ""12 Angry Men"". I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before.I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie."|1
Got to confess right up front that I didn't watch this entire movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or was I spared the first hour? The other reviewers sum this one up nicely. It was badly conceived. Badly scripted. Badly acted.But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire film, which appeared to have been dubbed, sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. There was a voluminous echo to the words, which just served to make the bad dialog hang. And hang. And hang.|1
I caught this movie on local t.v . at about 4:30 a.m . I did n't have expectations for it , but I did get a great deal, which I can't say for sure . I was very excited the movie did make me a little nervous , but after a few months had passed , it made me really happy . Thank you to all my friends who were there , I was very excited to see all of them in theaters . Thanks to all those who were there . I'll be back in 2 years to see it again .|0
Always enjoy the Classic Horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. This film was made during WW II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. Bob Steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture Bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film.|1

In a moment when he finally agrees, he reveals that the family has died, and Dr. Griffiths explains the causes of the disease. Kathariah returns as the main character after he is asked to help him in a matter involving his father. He is also asked to lead him back to their home to save his father and Dr. Griffiths' child.|0
At the same time John Russell was playing ranch owner Nathan Burdette, trying to free his no good brother Claude Akins from sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo he was working the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the high point of Russell's career, his most noted screen role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman.Russell kept law and order in Laramie the same way that James Arness did it in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed the all the minor characters that gave you the feel of Dodge City at the time.|1
This movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. I felt as if I was watching a car accident--sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. Although, it did fit the tone of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much.|1
"While I hold its predecessor, ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High,"" as a standard to which other teen comedies should be compared, ""The Wild Life"" is one of the better lesser known films from that time-and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. I believe its tagline reads, ""From the makers of FTARH, something even faster."" This definitely holds true. Though it may lack the depth of the former which tackles issues like first dates, teen sex, and abortions, ""The Wild Life"" is, nonetheless, a great flick."|1
One of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with `` Only for big fans of the lead actors or the directors, I will not include them. In this review, we'll go into this movie and talk about the movie, and you can play with us for just a few minutes. There are two main reasons why you will not find the film in the top five lists. First, I don't think the movie is a good movie, and we don't know anything about it. Also, it's a movie I've been watching in the past but have never been able to watch.|0
When I think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what I think of. I don't want a monotonous, one-song Robin Trower soundtrack; I want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. The film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent.|1
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... As I had not seen the Telegu movie so I could enjoy this movie even more.The story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies.|1
What ? - that was it ? The town sheriff ( John Agar ) blows up the mutant gorilla with a hammer. There is no more ape-killer here. I didn't ask for a word of warning .- he didn't give me any, I just kept saying I was scared, but that was very strange. He is not as cute as me , but when you think that's not the case , I guess I'll just stick to that word, I can tell you the story of how I got to see him when I was in Vietnam.|0
Someone says this anime could be offensive for girls... not really. Embarrassing situations are funny; first time i see this series i was in the video store, people around me started laughing, doesn't matter the age or gender. A teacher said that in order to guarantee the attention of someone in a book the beginning must be entertaining and the ending shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first minutes in the series the boy is hit by a car, during the last moments of the series, the same car appears.. Episodes had a touching and funny ending, specially last one.|1
This movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone , such as The Robe , Quo vivisomez , and The Raccoon Bride , all of which are believed by most Americans to have been inspired by the work of Charles Bukowski , in which Bukowski made it out in the 80s (and a decade later), that it was the work of Bukowski , who was the main man. Bukowski, who made his first appearances in the movie, would make his film debut in 1960 (with a few minor exceptions), his first big box-office success.|0
"A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farm house when in fact she lives in a NY apartment must come up with a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into an entertaining little screwball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in ""Double Indemnity,"" Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher."|1
If you have never heard of Jane Austen , seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation , or even the 1993 movie , if you have , it may be time for you to learn some of the finer things about Jane Austen . First of all , there is the story of Jane Austen , a young adult who lived a good life as a small girl in the early 1920’s. In this life, her life was spent in a strange world. She would sleep in the bed and dream all the time, trying to be her best friend while she worked.|0
This film is terrible. Not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it isn't shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of Broadway's The Secret Garden, decided that this would be a career step. The idea is interesting, two young girls coming of age very quickly. But the sex isn't even arousing. The film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat.|1
This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen . Its been a few years since I saw It . But the best movie ever! . And it's still one of my favorite movies. . There are a few of my favorite movies of all time . This movie has brought back memories of childhood , family and my great Grandparents' days. . . I am really happy about it. . This movie is one of the better ones that ever I watched . . And for some reason that's why it's so good. . .|0
this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection -- - hilarity , truth , fun , fun . Sophia is back! She's back in school, again. She doesn't do much, but she has a nice sense of humour and is pretty cool. When she's not, she's still enjoying being a schoolgirl, so it's fun to be able to do this. I think a bit of that will come with her being able to laugh a little bit more often and not have to wait too long.|0
Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Set the story on some Caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. And have the black woman be from Huggy Bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down Patty Hearst and you've got Black Mama, White Mama.In those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the Seventies are pushed in this one.|1
"I just watched this, an early Harold Lloyd short film that featured his ""glasses"" character on Kino Video's DVD of ""The Harold Lloyd Collection"". He's actually a con man with Snub Pollard as his partner who gets discovered by Bebe Daniels who herself performs fake séances. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk many customers by dropping fake rings that are ""lost"". I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny especially when Harold and Snub enter the place Bebe works and encounter some creepy contraptions and put on costumes like Snub trying one of Bebe's outfits."|1
"* * * SLIGHT SPOILERS * * * This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the storyline a bit, and gives us a flavor of its own:

Solo-themed characters

We have yet to meet any of the characters who look like the characters in Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Clone Wars. This is the first of a new series for Star Wars. It’s one we think is a great place to start. Star Wars: The Clone Wars takes a look at what’s next for the characters."|0
"This is an interesting movie. I think it's very humorous, although the humor is very black. Fulci is good and funny acting himself, it's a really funny and truly crazy ""self-portrait"" of an artist (""I make horror films. If I would make love films, no-one would buy tickets...""). And it's really SEXY movie also: Almost all the time there is some ""action"" or tension going on; and many sexy girls/women... Maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies/art in the first place..."|1
This film is absolutely appalling and awful . It 's not low budget , it 's a no budget film , it 's very well produced , the only way to go was to pay a lot of extra for it , if you are going to pay extra you need to be able to do that , like I said , this film is absolutely horrific , this is the type of movie you get from a cinema and you 're probably going to get some of it from the cinema , so I will be giving it a couple more days or even days to review .|0
"First off , I 'm a huge Bronson fan , have been since the late '70s . I watched every episode of '50s on TV but I only saw the first two episodes (which i did not get to watch in the first two years) and I never saw the whole first two episodes. Brett

Brett, I don't know about you, but I just want to know, is there anything that i can tell you? I'm in my 30th grade, so i've never seen a series that I didn't know I'd like."|0
This was touted as a sequel to Crash Dive , which was a very good film in the low budget, but it wasn’t quite as good as Crash Dive in many ways. There were several sequels in the first film, but there were only four sequels in this movie. I was a little bit disappointed that there was no release date but there was a number of films that didn’t have any release dates. There were several films that haven’t been released yet, and in this case I had only one film in the same year, but it wasn’t quite that bad.|0
The films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not achieve its full impact. As a result it does not appear in the cinematography either, although there are times when the film uses a green-blue skin and a green-red tone in the same image. This film uses a green-blue skin tone to create more of a noir feeling. The yellow-blue skin tones are similar to the greens. However, the red-black color used in this film differs from the green-blue in this film from a few points.|0
Yes sure , this is a Friday the 13th rip off but I have no problem with it . It makes for a lot of fun. : ) I was planning to send it and got it from the grocery store . It was easy to make and not too overwhelming for me . I don't have a cell phone . But I am glad I have one . I thought the cell phone would work and get you to pick it up . But now I have to use your cell phone . How do I pay for it? You don't even have to have it .|0
After the across-the-board success of MY NAME IS BARBRA , CBS television permitted Barbra to create an even more elaborate and exciting new program, THE BRAND OF THE SAME SONGS. The TV star, whose career is now about to resume, has made several appearances in television shows. It is not yet possible to know where this new program is heading, but CBS is hoping that it will come to the screen and start making a show of its own. If that sounds like a good idea, don't be surprised when Barbra tells CBS what she thinks of it — and that will be a wonderful experience.|0
"If you thought this is the french The Mummy and if you're hoping for another ""Vidocq""...well look elsewhere. It does have the same kind of story like The Mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the Louvre. I found the movie to be slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. The special effects aren't bad, but it's nothing spectacular as I was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until I realized that those kind of scenes were in The Mummy and this is Belhpegor."|1
"This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! The trailer makes this out to be a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action film. Press releases indicated that Shatner and Hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). If you like William Shatner (I do) see ""Free Enterprise"" instead."|1
Hello all ! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would 've given an excellent presentation but was having a difficult time seeing his own eyes. You can watch him here or on Youtube ! It's not a real movie but he has such a good idea about it. Anyway I would like to see some pictures of his face. I'm not very good with editing so this is my first time using it but I'll have to wait for you to finish it. I'd be really happy if I could show it to you!|0
It 's a shame . There 's an interesting idea here , but it gets completely lost in a confusion of what is really important and how to use it. I think the point of this posting is to explain how we need to talk about this very problem when we want to do something useful in this kind of way, but there are so few examples of this that I think it is not a very common one, but I am very glad to learn that it can be a very useful method for our needs, and how to use it in a very interesting way.|0
As I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 movie Ashes of Time  more specifically the 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word 'Redux' slapped on the end of the title  I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the film just didn't work out at all. I wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. In particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career?Well it's not too hard to figure out really.|1
"I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local rental store. Having just watched the latest Harry Potter installment, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description on back about ""an overzealous, evangelical Christian do-gooder,"" and identifying as an evangelical Christian, myself, I thought, ""Ooohthis should be interesting."" And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough, all too familiar."|1
This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles, even though the story's about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we'll have spinoffs like The Monk, The Priest, and others belonging to various religious sects.The basic premise goes very simply, that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb (so that it can lay claim to the title) goes around killing ex-convent girls.|1
My friends and I saw this at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was great. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. Rene is FINE!!! Seeing him take off his clothes was definitely worth the price of admission. Can someone forward me his contact info?My friend thinks Flex is the finer of the two. She's been a Flex fan for years though so she might be a little biased. The cousins were funny and just as trifling as Nana described them. LOL.I am looking forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.|1
Wow ! After the first five minutes of watching this `` film '' , I was quite tempted to put the film down with my phone. In the past I would get the phone to run and I'd call it a sec. But my phone didn't. It took about ten minutes. And it took a very long time. So I got the phone and I had to go. But this movie has been in my hand since the day I heard it, I get up and walk to the front door. So I was very curious.|0
In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the litter carrier Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plots with Seki to kill him. They strangle Gisaburo and dump his body inside a well in the woods, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the locals gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is haunted by his ghost.|1
"This owes a great deal to the plot of CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS . Although he is quite grown up , it is very interesting to find out how this guy, CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS , comes into his story. This is his first book and he had a great time making the story accessible . It was really entertaining and really helped to create a lot of fun and for this book to be a success it has to go a long way in creating a great story and make it an entertaining read. Book One

By the middle of the book we meet a guy who has had an accident."|0
"This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. ""THE HOLLOW"" is a great Hercule Poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. The acting was superb, and the music, as usual, was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either."|1
Dolemite is one of the best movies featuring a pimp as a hero , who takes down the man , who was his true friend , and kills it . It was the best pimp movie made by Hollywood. Now, it’s the best movie about a hero in Hollywood , with more than a dozen characters , each of them playing in different ways . It’s the one movie that has made us laugh . The best pimp movie is one where the hero turns into a “monster,” who turns into a real monster.|0

This movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films I've seen in a long, long while. To be fair, I was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but I was anticipating to at least be entertained. With such low expectations, how could I manage to be disappointed? Jim Carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his Fletcher Reede from Liar Liar.|1
All right , let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64 . The graphics were really good, even though my old computer wasn't really responsive. It was a really nice machine. I'm pretty sure that in the next couple days I'll get a machine for the 64 and maybe even the 128. As a matter of fact I'm going to buy it right now. I hope that you like it as a lot as you are. I just got my 64 and I love it, but I'm hoping for something like this.|0
I rented this movie for about $1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I have ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this.The plot... there is no plot. Everything you'd expect to happen, it does, only in a worse way. The acting was horrible. My dog could've done better. The special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief. And the cheesy lines.... I mean, why even bother? The only credit I can give this piece of sh*t are the opening scenes.|1
Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews/JaneSeymour version, I have to say that this is not good at all.According to the books, Percy is supposed to be a seeminglyfoppish aristocrat when he's being Percy, and witty and cleverwhen he's being the Pimpernel, but here he just looks bored asPercy and mean as the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to bethe most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due tobad make-up). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, andElizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat.|1
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace, as well as the dialog, churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.There are great little elements that pop up through out the film, like how Rob Lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe, or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy.|1
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite, which I try to catch on TV every year if I can. It revolves around a Martha Stewart like journalist named Elizabeth Lane, charmingly portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck. However, in contrast to Martha, this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley).Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children.|1
"I walked into Blockbuster, itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. So i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R!? YAY! Although I will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'Speed' then i was sold. Sadly Sandra really is not in this movie, her role is minor: ""Panicky kidnapped girlfriend"" (She is in fifth place on the actors listing for Jeebus shakes!)"|1
Take it from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of crap. Sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a DVD is absolutely ridicious.I have seen bad acting in my day but this is NO acting. The hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials. I hate to see his fan club.|1
Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot . There she is met by a girl of a different sex. She is the first African woman photographed in Johannesburg as a photographer in a non-Zulu African context. The first photograph was taken as a child. Gemser was born in Johannesburg, North African city, Johannesburg. She was originally from the same community and is now in South Africa, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Gemser's story has been shared with photographers all over the globe, including Kenya, Cameroon and Tanzania.|0
What is night vision? Well according to the star (Williamson) let's see...one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which he replies 'it makes for better.........'night vision.' What in the hell does that mean? In fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? It has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. Not to mention a cop on duty drinking, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos his murders.|1
"I was expecting a lot more of this film than what I actually got. The acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of something I don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy. An example of the acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, is upset the South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the ""sand map"". It was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic."|1
I have n't seen so many people packed outside a theater since Star Wars Episode III . Both shows sold out fast, but the Star Wars movie didn't last. There was never any way to get back to the theater in the first place. As it turns out, that's a fact, not a fiction, as many theaters were built as they've ever seen them. The Star Wars movies only lasted a couple hours and a half (or less) in theaters. There's a lot of hype for the movie, but they don't do it for the real thing.|0
"In watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a ""model"" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other ""famous"" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill."|1
`` The Racketeer '' stars Carol ( deprived of the `` e '' that usually appeared at the end of a book'' and the `` r '') were a very popular name in America. They were especially popular, especially in the early '70s. In the '90s the Racketeer was replaced by Racketeers ''; they were not the most popular of all the '' names. The `` e '' was often used as an alias to many other '' names. It had several uses in the 1960s, but it was never used in many of the '' names, although the first one was used in the 1950s.|0
As much as I respect firefighters for what they do . I was unimpressed and bored with this film . I was bored and had to get rid of this film . I went on vacation and took a class in the film and went to the movies . I was bored and didn't go on vacation . I was bored and had to go to school . It was a depressing film . it was depressing and sad . I would go to the movies and be bored and didn't go on vacation . The thing is I went on vacation . It was depressing and sad .|0
I am not understanding why people are praising this movie. I didn't like it at all. I watch it with several people. None of them cared for it either. First of all. It is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. The actual filming looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When you watch the movie along with the DVD extras. You will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. There is no talent.|1
This film is absolute cinematic genius. It has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance. The effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie. Jack Long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well, he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil. If your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy. For any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin.|1
It 's 2005 , my friends ... a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology . So I am a big fan of all the cool and fun things that are happening in the world today, but I don't think we can all do the same. I think we do better than you could have ever imagined, and I just think that we could get back to the days where we had all been there. That is what makes my work so special. It is so much more important than anything that we do.|0
Young, ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days, she encounters strange happenings, even a patient in her bedroom watching her, yet she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge), but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is okay at best, and the acting is surprisingly alright, but after awhile it's gets to be a little much.|1
I 'm a big fan of surrealist art , but this film by Bunuel ( with some ideas from Dali) is kind of boring. It just doesn't make sense to me and I would like a little more detail. I don't get why I'm a fan of surrealist art, but I don't understand how it works, so I decided to ask myself, what are the reasons, where to go? Anyway, I'm interested to find out, if you know anyone who would like to help, give a talk, show some work, or get some support from a certain person.|0
It's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film. Jean-Pierre Limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft-porn movie. Having seen, loved, admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss - albeit as the result of Alzheimer's - in a profound and heartbreaking way, not least in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre I find that Novo is an insult to Se Souvenirs.|1
Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best...although I really can't say that as Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever watched. But still, it's a good film. Strange, but good.The movie is in three acts, much like the novel...which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay. Anyhow, we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with Also Sparach Zarathustra blaring on the speakers. Then comes the boring beyond belief 'Dawn of Man' sequence.|1
This Blake Edwards film is n't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy , a drama or a comedy . It's got some of the best writing, actors and production designs of any film of the past decade, and it has the potential to become a cult classic , even as it has gone through a number of bad reviews. I know this is just my personal preference , I've never watched any other movie, it's just a great movie . I loved it so much, that I'm so glad I went on to watch the movie.|0
I love cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. But this movie absolutely stank, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? Give me a break.Don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series.|1
Van Sant copies Hitchcock's masterpiece shot for shot including some modern facets: a walkman, and nudity from Anne Heche. Unless you have a strong desire to see Ms. Heche naked there is absolutely NO reason to see this film instead of the original. Hitchcock's masterpiece is much better and Van Sant fails to realize that in hiding the nudity and the gore, the original shower scene is all the more terrifying. Ask Janet Leigh about that one. The acting is also much flatter and the technical aspects much less impressive.|1

I watched this movie and all I can say is this ... I am not a film student , nor do I have any interest in going into the next chapter in my career. I am just interested in seeing things unfold in my own life and my career. I am also curious to find out what I was really interested in seeing when I graduated in high school. I did not go into that chapter so I can not tell you what I did in college. I did not study hard for any of these credits, I took the hard earned courses I got out of high school.|0
"I would like to know if ""The Outsiders"" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD?There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total.The Young German Actor in the series was also in a German TV series called ""Black Forest Clinic"" which aired here in the UK with English dialogue superimposed with the lip-sync. I look forward to hearing any comments from TV Industry personnel on the above questions, thank you in advance."|1
I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory , non stop action of the characters in the movies , i found a movie review based on the reviews for the characters , but i didn't find anything to say in my review . But i am really interested in the movie and if you can find a review for this movie that i will recommend . This is a good review about the characters of this movie . It was written by the author of the movie so it should be read by you.|0
It might be that the film I saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw , however it was a pretty well-produced film. It is still one of the biggest films of its kind, and the only other one I saw that was any less bad. However, when you have made a lot of movies like this I’ve got to say that you can’t beat this one. It is certainly not as bad a movie as I remember it, though I am not really sure as to the exact rating.|0
I have read almost all the books by now , and have seen the musical production in two different languages. They are very good and very entertaining. I also found it entertaining and interesting to read some of the books, as if they are some kind of work of great art. It's good to read them in their true form, and to have their stories told as I see fit in the theatre. When I was young, there were so many books I read, that I did not think that I would ever have read anything by my older self.|0
"My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a totally dull one. Remember Steven Seagal? You don't? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up on. After starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss. Now, he stars in low-budgeted B-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-TV ""Movie of the Week"" entries that lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among these, shall we say, dead action movies."|1
I've seen several stage and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. I later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a Christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing the Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously.|1
Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids , this movie centers around some freak named Tom (who was in his early twenties , but still makes good movies with some big screen appearances) and his brother (played by Chris Brown). One of the movie’s highlights is when the young Tom becomes obsessed with finding a man to marry. His brother tries to get his brother to marry him but he fails. The movie plays on the idea that people get married and they will marry when they become adults.|0
Mean spirited , and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children 's tale not only lacks the charm of the '30s, but perhaps lacks the wit. There's just something about this kid who comes out of his shell and starts talking to his friends, which seems to make him a bit mean, but he is still just a kid, and he's never going to be a real kid anymore. He's pretty much as good at the game as the kids were. He has a good grasp of speech and his ability to be able to communicate easily is excellent.|0
Mr. Bug Goes to Town was one of those films that I grew up hearing about , however a copy of it recently came out at the Sundance Film Festival in January of 2014, which was a huge success. The film, directed by David Lean, was released in June of 2013, and earned $3.1 million at the local box office. It was critically acclaimed by filmgoers for its outstanding production and outstanding visual storytelling. The film won an awards ceremony for best picture, best director at Sundance, and was nominated for an Oscar.|0
While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home.|1
I am a huge Eric Roberts fan, I collect his movies and so far has get to 60. But I´m honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies. But hey that´s why I like him - he is entertaining.But this one has to take the price, I can´t stop wonder why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and also Corbin Bernsen to the picture.While Bernsen is plain awful (I really don´t like him), Roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie (and that doesn´t mean much).|1
"Right ... so you have a dam , tons of water ( that seems to flow really really slowly )

I'd like you to make sure that the water absorbs the energy of the water as well. There's a lot of information out there. I've seen this in other forums as well. I've also read a few other blogs with similar issues. Here's my problem and my solution:
I have two water meters on the outside of my house; the water is in a pool in the garden."|0
Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins . The premise is that the nation 's dissidents ( hippies, homosexuals, drug-addicts and so on) had been brought to justice, or perhaps to prison, by an anti-gay activist who called it 'punish'. Peter Watkins explains why this 'punishment' comes to us. This article was originally written by Peter Watkins at the New York Times. There are many people in the world who might not have believed the New York Times would publish such a piece. However, the Times has published a piece by Paul Daley titled, 'Punishment at the Centre' .|0
Once again , Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people . This time the traveling circus put a stop to these people . They brought their own food , they were very sorry that they are not eating their food . In the end , they were just a piece of candy and that was all fine . But for the time it was so hard to stop them . And when they started to eat it, there was not any problem . And this time they were just happy . So it was very difficult to keep going . It was just like a lot of candy.|0
How did this film get into the Berlin Film Festival ? I understand it got into the Panorama section , but I just couldn't figure it out . I have no idea why this film was getting into the Berlin Film Festival. In my humble opinion it is the most exciting feature film I have ever heard. I have never watched it before, but I have always wondered what would happen if this film got into a festival. I think it is going to give the audience a bit of a buzz. But I still have a question.|0
Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sauce's assassin Shax. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadow how to vanquish the demon, Prue and Piper fight and chase Shax on the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and exposed live in the television news as witches. They become national sensation with a crowd in front of their house. Phoebe trusts on Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to summon Tempus and revert time while a fanatic woman shots Piper, who dies.|1
This movie was extremely boring . I only laughed a few times . I decided to rent it when I got home and did not like it. I have to say I was actually enjoying it . I would recommend it if you want to get the best version of the movie. Also, watch the original version . I will have to see it again if my daughter does not like it as well . I think she will not enjoy it too . I'm still trying to decide if it is better than other movie versions . But, it was just a great movie for a little bit .|0
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting , and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship . I think it would have been the easiest way to find the source of this conflict and it is very hard to find . If we don’t see any change in Portman and Sarandon in the next couple of weeks it’s too early to think about the impact that a change like that can have on a man. Just as a side note, this is the most obvious example to see of a change that can have some impact on a woman.|0
I find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered and isolated, but we don't know what we need to do for that to happen in our lifetime. So when I started writing a book to help you understand it, I thought I'd share just a few of the many great articles and articles and articles and materials that have been written around here on Earth, so if you'd like to get some inspiration for your life, I would love to hear from you.|0
"I'd never thought that I would be caught saying this: But I think ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of ""High Octane"" cop shows such as CSI, CSI: Miami, and so forth. I'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series."|1
"""Eaten Alive"" goes down much easier than Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" but it's also a far more sillier film. I mean, at times it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so mind-numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end. Tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) teams up with Janet Agren (The Gates of Hell; here with an intolerable accent) to search the jungles of New Guinea for Agren's sister, who's been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov)."|1
"I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.I liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. Definitely not what the DVD cover claims, ""Destined to be the next stoner classic"", hardly.Wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast.Almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on."|1
"Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes Camp Blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, ""Camp Bloody awful""), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... Awful acting-check. Bad script-check. Tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. It doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted cliché imaginable."|1
"This film is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which I usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. A few friends go out on Halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before that it has the cliché ""You really believe that? Ha ha ha, it's just a story"" routine dragged out for a while."|1
"The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel ""Nanny"" Crosby, who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. Nanny's ability ""to take fragments and make them whole"" affects everyone within her sphere."|1
I have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life , but none are coming to mind right now.. I can see my heart beat faster and I love to run so much.. so much.. it really makes me happy that I have this many hours of work done and have no problems running so much. And it is great to have an amazing job that I have no problem doing in a long time. I have found a lot of tips that I could use to get me through the rest of the day.|0
This was my late wife's favorite film. I'm sorry she did not live long enough to have the video as I'm sure she would have worn it out. What can we say? A great romantic story and the push off of two great men, the Raisuli and Teddy Rex. Sean Connery and Brian Keith are great in these roles. But while Connery is his usual sexy sex, it's the late Brian Keith who gives us a solid performance as the mercurial Teddy Roosevelt. Back up is provided with Candy Bergen, gorgeous in her early 30s, as the kidnapped American widow.|1
I really don't know much about the Marquis de Sade, not having read any of his book, but I never imagined him as a flaming queen. Carson Kressley of Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, or Jack from Will and Grace would have fit easily into the role that Nick Mancuso gave us.The movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the Paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor. What? They can't afford a room?|1
Your idol will deceive you in this movie . Stephen Nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending over backwards for her job as a junior assistant teacher to an elementary school. He may even be a very good actor. He’s a young man now, and so is she. And what does it matter? He’s a good man, and a very good actor too. But you know what’s wrong and it’ll get worse, even if you’re smart enough to watch this movie anyway.|0
Well , I have to agree with the critics on this one , who all said `` leave it alone , I've got a plan in my head , it will be in my head, it will be my goal and it will not be.'' I don't think that that would happen, it seems to be a plan, I have been told, a lot of people will believe what they are saying now that they believe what they believe. I can see why everyone would be upset, but I don't believe they're right.|0
This film is good in it 's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget . Looks like the director will like it because he can work it into a film by making it more realistic with a good camera. I guess, that's not very good at it's style, but I really don't think it was a bad thing either. It was the best movie ever made on the screen for the first time ever by someone like me, so there's no excuse not to film it. When you look at it, it was pretty amazing.|0
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around . Never has a movie surpassed anything. That movie was actually a great movie from the 60's and 80's, but I have always loved movies with some great elements. And it has been great for me since I have watched it many times since I got to the theater when I was a teenager. And I have only been to a few movies in my childhood that I have ever seen. I love movies and have watched many movies in my adult life.|0
A genuinely creepy ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie just falls short of what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and perhaps relies a little too much on a simple premise. For most of the way, its imaginative and genuinely gripping, but at the end its almost like Oshima just lost interest in it, and brought it to a rapid ending.The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so that they can be together. But their failure of nerve and his returning ghost condemn them to madness.|1
There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her orphaned niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. And that reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his floppy haircut and appealingly laddish attitude, looks good enough to slap between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with an olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette dip and a few finely diced sun dried tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean.|1
"OK, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. That was the main reason I went to see this film. But it was so boring, that I nearly felt asleep. Sorry, but her talents as actress are not very convincing. Furthermore, this film was presented as having outstanding special effects and CGI. Yeah, for a B-Movie it is not that bad. After having seen her in ""Marquise"" some years ago (also a very crappy film), I thought that she would play more convincingly."|1
I love Ustinov 's distinctive , literate narration . And the photography is quiet nice . We put the film back in the studio in the summer to shoot our new book. And I have an idea . This is the book that we have been working on the last couple of years, we have been trying to get the film right and working on the film, we have been working with the idea of putting the film back in the studio as well, which is the story of a film. The story is very well written, and I have never done an original screenplay before.|0
Everything Is Illuminated A young Jewish American searches for the woman that helped his grandfather escape Nazi persecution while embarking on his own adventure through the New York City borough of Manhattan, New Jersey. He found her in search of her “mother”, in the basement of the New York City Museum building. He was surprised at how much of his mother’s time and money she had been given in exchange for her role in helping the Nazis. His search for her grew increasingly complicated. In the months before he was rescued, she called to him to ask whether he could help.|0
Please...if anybody gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie, if it can be called so, refrain from it... do not waste your time!!!! I too watched this film right after finishing the book, and was seriously disappointed... the main character is basically a new made up Fanny, for she shows NO resemblance whatso ever to the book...she's so lively and laughing all the time... if there was one thing the author wanted to set on this was that she was a very shy, introverted character.... please!!!!!|1
"I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper . No respect whatsoever to many of those who are doing it. But then I read this movie and I thought, ""What if this is the book I wrote in"" (I'm sure that was written before this one.) I thought it was a really great story that you don't read every night. But then again, I'm sure it's not. If you like my book, please do not hesitate to give it away."|0
It was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year 's best family film. It all began with the words “A young mother and daughter’. This film was nothing new at that time, except that this film was actually a children’s tale. The film is set in a house, in a home. A young lady has to find an infant that’s in the family, but she’s not allowed to move in the house until the baby has come.|0
Hannibal must be the most God-awful movie I have seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it don't bother. I wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on TV... change the channel. The only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it).|1
"I just realized why the colors and sets in ""Sakuran"" were so flashy and gaudy, and just painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. You couldn't call it acting."|1
Almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. From the misjudged, often incomprehensible script onwards Dr Rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience. Sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over-wrought, OTT and middle aged and the men are young, vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex. The director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances.There is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on.|1
Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) is found wandering around the area. She has two daughters and three sons. The first was born in 1987, and has now become one of the top 10 children of Isabelle ( Kristin Erickson ) ( 2017 ). The second daughter was born in 2007 and is the one who first became Isabelle's mother. The youngest child, Isabelle was born in 2012, and the youngest son in the family is now a professional soccer player with the Oakland Raiders .|0
Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother, Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the movie begins. Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It's really deep and touching, thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw, and so is Sarandon.|1
"This is a really silly job of miscasting--about as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The lead part Hepburn plays is a combination of Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This film is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play a hillbilly--he was just surrounded by them. And the dialog sounds as if it comes right from a Li'l Abner strip! The problems don't really end with the outrageous casting, though, as the plot is completely muddled and the ""love story"" might make your head hurt."|1
Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. With fifty years of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their heads at the time.|1
'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.Trusting the latest Hollywood fad, vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent, asexual, love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore. This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past... well, at least in the second half. 'Thirst' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story.|1
This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school, early high school age kids. Maybe to them it's funny, they may possibly even see something scary in it. To me, the acting is poor, and plot is poor, there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer. I saw this film as weak and boring. At times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized. The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds, they don't seem to have any substance other than the look.|1
"I went into this movie with an open mind. I had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. I promised him I wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes I told him I would have to take back my promise. We kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.This ""movie"" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the IMDb Bottom 100."|1
Once again , Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load . It has humour ( `` You 're a good girl !`` ), and the art of storytelling. You can read all of this for yourself on this website . But for those of us who care deeply about science fiction , the story we tell is the best for science fiction , and to give you the best gift we have, we've made an effort to get some of it translated into English for you to watch as a gift for those who are curious about science fiction fiction.|0
"Well, after the hype surrounding the film and after Surya labeling the film as PATH-BREAKING, I went into the theatre expecting something big. Boy was I disappointed. First of all, the characterizations in the film are SO weird! Which wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiotic, coo-coo one? And what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? What was the purpose of that scene anyway? To start a vulgarly shot ""Maaja Maaja""?"|1
I loved this show . Such talent ; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled , after only a second , it was supposed to be in Japan . But i just watched this ,and i got no reply . But now that it is not cancelled, its still in Japan . It's been very bad , and it is not working as well as my TV , which is supposed to be working but now that it has been cancelled , it hasn't finished. But i got no response . And i got no other explanation of my problem. Thanks.|0
When a bomber , a patricide , a pornographer , and a mad biker , together with various other forms of society , are in need of the services of human beings capable of such services. These services can be carried out by means of various means, such as for example a machinegun, an electric motor, or an infrared laser. The human beings generally are capable of performing these services in a manner that is more pleasant to the user than if the human beings were simply provided with only a limited range of human beings in which to carry out the service.|0
"I've seen some Bible-based trash. This one tops it all. To make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a stench of ""let's make the Biblical account look retarded."""|1
"This was pretty bad - from bad acting , bad technical details , bad camera shots , and bad audio . This was pretty bad, but I am pretty happy, because I'm now getting paid to do this. Thank you for the reply and hope that you are doing well. Re: How do I start this post with more details? The only thing that could help you is to take the information into your head and give it to the community. You can try and figure out what the best way to do that is to read the ""How do I Start this post"" thread on this forum."|0
the plot of this movie revolves around this submarine builder who's a real bastard and he wants to launch his new sub that can travel thousands of feet deep. unfortunately, he can't. oh yeah, and he's haunted by the memories of his mom and dad getting eaten by a megalodon when he was a child. the guy meets some scientist whos pretty hot, and they and this crew of about a hundred people set out on the main character's submarine to kill the same megalodon that killed his parents.now, the shark in this movie is a really fake looking CGI shark.|1
In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans , in the beginning of the Twentieth Century , the Moroccan economy was destroyed because it was a socialist country. On the eve of Independence Day on September 17, 1887, a delegation of United States states and their allies traveled to France in an effort to help the revolution. The French were shocked to learn that America was preparing for independence and that its government was preparing to invade Morocco . On September 17, 1896, the US government signed an armistice with Morocco , a country known as the First Anglo-American War (AAC).|0
"This one and the one prior ""Toulon's Revenge"" and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice. It is basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series."|1
"Going into the movie with the right expectations, I somewhat liked this movie. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clichéd, and I could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. But, the dancing sequences were VERY well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which I enjoy watching). The music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the ""drama"" scenes more bearable."|1
UK-born Australian helmer Alex Frayne calls for attention with his strange, necessitating a meticulous read, visually stunning Modern Love (2006). Following the steps of a man incapable of controlling a drastic personality change spurred by the death of a close relative pic offers a fascinating examination of human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia.John (Mark Constable), his wife Emily (Victoria Hill), and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small Southern town to take care of his deceased uncle's (Don Barker) property.|1
Like a lot of the comments above me, also I though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.But that is not the only comment. The scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as I will explain a in a few moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. The physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking.|1
WOW ! ! Talk about a film that divides the audience ! This is a real love it or loathly love of the movies that are being made today ! I am not saying that you are the one who will be making such movies in the future ! There are a couple things that you will learn about that you need to see ! First, when you start a movie it is hard to do anything but watch, so I am trying to help you develop your knowledge of those movies, I hope you will become acquainted with the films you are watching !|0
"I saw this movie on the shelf at Blockbuster and thought it looked cool. The DVD case touted so many great actors and I wondered to myself, ""Why have I never heard of this movie?"" Then I turned over the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, and thus the answer began to explain itself. First of all I want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this movie is so terrible. Okay, the script is awful and full of one dimensional characters."|1
This is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production. Martha Coolidge herself said she only had 350,000 dollars to work with. This is a movie that I loved growing up in the midwest. I remember friends and I having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago. Great things about this movie....Great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. Bad points of this movie....To small of a budget calling for way too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better.|1
I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams , back in the early days of TV. For this was the first time he was in the booth with the show on TV. That was an event that happened during a long summer break at the YMCA and they had been there for a couple of years. Jim and I were at the show together and Jim and I took a picture together. It was an amazing moment for us. We loved the guy we were having fun together with. We were doing a few episodes of The Tonight Show in late June.|0
I can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life . After watching it, I know it can’t go on long. It’s so bad that I don’t want it to continue to get better. So I think it’s time to do some more reviews and give some thought to how badly this is gonna work. I’ve only ever seen it when I was at a party, but now I can honestly see it in action. It’s so nice.|0
This is n't exactly a complicated story . It 's not a mystery , or a plot you have to understand, but it's pretty neat . . . . It is the story of a couple . . . . A couple years ago, I was sitting in the library at night watching television when I received a note from a friend who, after looking up the title of the book they were discussing, found out that the title of this particular book was The Last Song. They said, “It’s pretty clear.|0
"'The Shining ' has wit , visual flair and an iconic performance by Jack Nicholson . 'Ausentes , ' however , have never been allowed to perform at such an extraordinary time. In fact he is a great performer.

""I think we're all looking forward to seeing these movies again""

A team varied between Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot, and the guy who plays Bana on Seinfeld, go up to an Arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves. They discover there's a worm- a virus- that is parasitic to the point of madness and death. The problem is, after a certain dog lashes out, anyone could be infected, but who? This is not just my favorite episode of season 1, but also one of my favorites from the show.|1
Wow,this is in my opinion the best sitcom since Friends. If you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer (if you are old enough that is.if not a root beer will have to do.) and watch a couple of episodes,it's the perfect recipe for happiness.The thing I like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing. After a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the shows success is that they have an enviable life.|1
Having been raised in Canada , I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC . I have seen many other Canadians . I heard about it a lot . I read about it in Canadian magazines, but I can't recall seeing it all. I don't really remember anything about the story , except for the title. When I read about it, I thought maybe I'm seeing something about it. Maybe it's the fact that I didn't really like the name . I thought it was awful . I have seen so many other Canadians , I am just looking at it now.|0
OK , to start with , this movie was not at all like the book . I read the book at home and it is the most beautiful book I have ever read . It is beautifully written , detailed , and of high quality . I have just finished it , so I am sure it will be the best book I ever read . And this is one of the most beautiful books ever written. The first thing that impressed me the most was the way the narrator is shown . It is beautiful , as the story is a novel , as well as an autobiography , and a memoir .|0
"this really is an ""okay"" series.. everyone in it is pretty good. but i just can't take Reba. she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent!! if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day..i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before, Reba IS destroying the show. however the 20 year old guy (dont know his name) but he's soooo funny, and he's really saving it all..so here's the recipe to get a great show."|1
This film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in search of freedom. The documentary is an attempt to bring all the events and characters into perspective. It's a little short-lived, in that it is not a film that gets a little short of an idea. It's not an easy task in the film to make a documentary on free men, and it's probably one of the most poorly made movies we've had in the whole of history. But it's a great documentary in many ways. 1.|0
The subject matter was good, direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major. The acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best. The casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle.|1
"This film was utterly horrible. Stupid premise, and horrible acting by all. Whoever wrote this trash should be hanged. Reminds me of a hack student film, BUT WORSE. Who ever produced this should give up now. I know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think this ""fantastic"" as some think ""Dune (1984)"" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real films. OK, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been far better, but it didn't so it suffers."|1
cool flick. enjoyable to watch. hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. i really like the location setting with all the new york references. it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end. the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters. there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better. i think the supporting actress did a great job in her role. the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn together seamlessly and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive.|1
It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial `` wake-up call '' . And , you know: the moment you've seen it, the first time you've seen it. In this week's edition of our New York Review of Books, on Thursday, April 19th, we review and analyze the book we've written so far and what we think might be of interest to anyone looking to explore it. Here's the synopsis for it, if you are interested. What's this book about? It's a beautiful story, but it's hard to imagine what it could be.|0
The odd thing about Galaxina is not that it is supremely bad, although it is. The odd thing is that in spite of being supremely bad, it is not funny. Supremely bad movies have their own particular brand of unintended humor--the secret of their success, you might say. But Galaxina is quite uniquely different--it is MST3K's worst nightmare, a bad movie in which the intentional *and* the unintentional humor alike fall flat.It is easy enough to figure out why the intentional jokes fail--and the reasons are quite varied.|1
Before I start to tear apart this movie , mark you -- I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL . That story was a big mess . . . I did a lot of reading and thought that I knew how to put it together but I wasn't ready to do it on my own . . . I'm sorry, but that's all. . . You know, I have been working on something so many different things, and when I think about all of that , it's not a big deal to me but I have been working on something and that's what I have been doing.|0
I acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it I found this little gem. Here's what it looked like when it first came out and how it looked in the video above. It was almost like it would've been in some kind of 3D film. But the thing that most struck me was the way it was actually constructed, and it had some parts that were in fact 3D parts, or something like that. I'd say they were some parts that looked like 2D parts.|0
It may be , although there are still two or three I 've missed . This film constructs an interesting and entertaining story that I have been meaning to film for a while, with a few other elements which may or may not play to the screen, but I am happy to leave it. I have made it work for me, however, and hope this is not my last. I will post it later on, so you can enjoy it as it is, but please note that I did not make it to the screen.|0
First the premise stinks...little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old, You've seen 'em in a dozen 50's & 60's films. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people signed on just to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, Would somebody tell Shirley she did her best comedy in TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. See it...if there's no reruns of Andy Griffith on.|1
As one of the victims of the whole Enron scandal , my mother forced me to watch this movie with her, which made me cry. She wanted me to watch it and tell her that I couldn't help but cry when I watched it. And so I did, and it turned out to be a terrible experience because she didn't give up on me. So now I don't watch it, because it's horrible. Then I can't help crying. But I was in love with the movie, and when I saw it, it was so painful.|0
Three distinct and distant individuals ' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another . The one-hour film, in this case, takes place in the same world as the last, and it is filmed in different parts of the city . The first shot was taken at the intersection of the streets of the city , then shot in front of an abandoned warehouse . A second shot taken at the same location, then taken in front of the same building . The final shot is at the same intersection , taken in front of an abandoned warehouse .|0
This was a great film in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves.|1
This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating . If you 're trying to impress some girl , you're trying to impress a dude , you'll 've got a lot to prove. You 've got to put your best foot forward when you're thinking of dating someone you're not really feeling . This is a pretty great movie for young ninjas who 've got to be looking for you , and it's perfect for anyone with a hot body , who just want to spend some time dating someone they 've been dating for a while.|0
At first sight, I must say already, watch The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot.The Detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom.Really, what you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? Don't blame him, he needs the money.This was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago.|1
The Girl in Lovers Lane is one strange little low-budget film. On its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), that Bix meets who would like to look out for him. Nothing overly interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when Carrie is murdered.|1
Watching the preview of Armored I thought the movie was either going to be a very bad or a very good film. Thankfully, the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and realistic. There never is the perfect crime, and Armored showed why. The movie show perfectly when people get into stressful situation they behave like animals. The last hour of the film is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years of age. I would buy this movie. I give Armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie.|1
"I am not familiar with the producer's other works, but this movie is a piece of crap. I never saw the MST3K version, but I can tell you, Mike and the Bots probably didn't save it. I love a grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but this was almost unwatchable.There was no credit for who did the voice of ""The Dark One"". Sounded a bit like Patrick Stewart at times.A group of high school students who found a junk super-8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that."|1
2001 : A Space Odyssey Is it a sermon ? An account of the history of mankind ? An exploration of a variety of events that have happened to humanity, such as slavery, torture, exploitation, and murder ? The following is the title of this article in honor of a series of articles that I wrote recently about the events of the 1970s and 1980s that are at least partially attributable to this topic. It's not a series of articles, because the topics covered in each article are not identical, so the content does not change with each article.|0
First of all I dunno if I was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget! Here we go....Basically there were so many years and gaps that I don't understand, its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? I think this is a big flow. Forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history , this movie doesn't have only history facts issues, but also has so many flaws.|1
Christopher Nolan 's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out . Shot on a small studio apartment in Hollywood, the film will be released this July. It is one of five features released this weekend in the UK, and one of five feature films released in the US last Friday. It will be released on Friday, and on Friday evening it will also be screened at the Edinburgh Fringe, a festival held in the West End of London in late July and August. The release date for the film is May 1, and is scheduled to be released on June 1.|0
This is one of those movies that you just do n't want to end . The characters are rich like you would a movie with the theme of being rich . They can do all kinds of things with different characters that can be said for different characters and they do things with characters that you would never think about . And you would always be thinking of people and they would think that their character's story is different than the one that you would always be thinking of . And so this movie has become a reality . The movie that you want to see in your house .|0
When I first watched this film, I thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. He gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work. He is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and American dream-working class hero trash (which I'm not). I don't get it. How can this film get away with being so naf. That bit with the little boy being rescued, I mean, come on!|1
It is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as Deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this one of the best. That said, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is considering this film as one of the best. Though the film’s cast and director have worked with some other directors, most of them were excellent, and so did I. As much as I appreciated the director’s approach, and because I thought the film could have benefited from this, I don’t think it could have done much better for the director.|0
Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. No, this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through.|1
"Mount Godwin-Austin ( otherwise known as K2 ) is the world 's second highest mountain , and if the evidence is to be believed there is a lot to be learned about him. This is the third book in a trilogy. There are six chapters, and it was last published in 2013. The last chapter is an excerpt of this novel. One of the most revealing of all the books to me, the third part is,

The most important thing to me is to be aware that I am only an animal."|0
The plot is somewhat original , and all the actors did their job pretty well . There is a plenty of plot and the characters are pretty good in all of the books . I was surprised to see them not being able to read all the plot lines , especially the ending. They were able to read all the characters but I have not yet checked if they could have read all the plots but they were being read in very bad form so it is just not very helpful . I think I have not seen this movie in several years .|0
This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a long time.It's marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it's nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers.|1
High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels(Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch). He'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. Some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of.|1
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible, a drunkard, a bad father, a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still I do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits.|1
"This is a very strange series with Dean Learner . I really did n't understand the guests . I knew I'd get bored with them . . . There is a time when I felt like I needed to change my habits . It is that time when I was afraid to change my behaviour . I feel as if I didn't know myself . . I feel a little afraid of myself . . I feel like I don't know who you are. I have no idea what I would feel like, how I might feel. There are three types of feelings:

I must first mention that as a group of mates, we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value, hence our rental of Camp Blood.Camp Blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder, and was so rubbish it wans't even funny.The DVD was returned and a refund was demanded, with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked.Don't do what I did, and let the curiosity get the better of you, it's so bad it's not even funny.|1
Son of the Mask is a terrible movie . I do n't like the baby and I do n't like the kids but I don't care if I get pregnant. But the only bad part of the movie is that I can't watch it because I dont want to be stuck in my own bed and that makes me sad to watch it and that makes me happy . Well I just wanted to say that I cant watch it , but that's it ! i really loved this movie. i watched it and i watched the whole thing.|0
It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he's back in the spotlight. He's been gone for over eight months, but his time with the Redskins has flown by. And it will be all right for the Redskins next season. For starters, we have a lot of them who have never had a game to play and have done well. So it will be nice to see Bruce Willis continue to have a great season. But right now he's gone a long way back in the game.|0
Admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. They weren't low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the Marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to Oley Sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy TV series such as 'Hercules' and 'Viper'. With a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film.|1
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. One late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery.|1
I love this movie . Yes , the main character lies , but that 's why it 's called ``Titanic'' in English . That is also the last part that you could read about :-). If you want to find out how many times you have read a few times, that's all the story. This is not the first movie that you'll read about, but the first ones that you will have read. In this movie, I found the first of these to be the best ones. You'll also find out how many times you have read a few times in the movie.|0
This is one of the most horrible 'scary ' movies I 've seen for awhile . I had to wonder if it really happened, but it is a great movie . I can't help it, especially in the first hour of the film . I was trying to imagine if he would get in trouble to kill me. The guy has to kill him, and I'd like to think he does, and I'm really not even sure if my imagination can handle the whole story . But if I could figure that out for myself I would .|0
"I watched this expecting to see the usual British stiff upper lip stereotypes and was surprised to find the dialogue remarkably natural and tinged with black humour. It was more like Eastenders Goes to Sea than In Which We Serve. The scenes during the approach and attack are remarkably realistic in their depiction of a fighting ship and the stuff ups and banter among the ship's company (well at least based on my service in the 1970s). Some of the throwaway lines are very witty (""I'm not joining the Band of Hope just to please some greasy fish fryer!)."|1

"I think ""category 6: day of destruction"" was very unrealistic. The digital effects where like a children's cartoon. The actors didn't act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her. The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on. The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny!Please keep the special effects real.I liked the comment: ""What did we do to p.i.s.s-off Mother Nature? ""I don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines."|1
Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz.|1
Oh my god, WHY, did I waste my precious time on this film? It is pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic, and one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. Yes, MY LIFE. I am embarrassed for Yash Raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.This is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie I have ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I cringe for them, I really do.|1
"GOLD RAIDERS (1951)A dull western/comedy feature with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, who I've always enjoyed as the ""third Stooge"") doing their usual schtick, and directed by the normally dependable Edward Bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder, just what went wrong this time? The most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike so many of their classic short subjects, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting."|1
Movie Title - TartDate of review - 5/26/02Year of movie - 2001Stars - Dominique Swain , Brad Renfro , Bijou Lefèvre , Bijou Stéphane . . . . . . . The title of the film was originally created from a poem written in 1799 by a poet named Jean Paul. The poem is not in the traditional sense of a poem; it is simply an expression of an idea. In addition, the title also refers to Jean Paul who was born on December 11, 1798, in Paris, on the island of Mauritius.|0
A film by Almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time . The capitalized print which opens the Spanish language market . I’m sure it’s in fact a great film that you will love to see and enjoy with your family . It’s such an amazing movie . There are two versions of this movie. One is the English version. The English version tells us the story of several young women from the Spanish town of Seville who are traveling with a young man named Pablo who has a very young child, named Isabel, and her friends in the village.|0

"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36"" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12."|1
The only good either of the Problem Child films caused was bringing together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. Ben eventually picks Lawanda (played by the most underused original SNL-er Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies don't suit Junior in the least.|1
This film has some flaws , and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening . Possibly the most serious one , it’s a problem with the fact that the film shows how the film is making progress , which can lead to a “saturation” of what is coming to the film, especially in the last part . For example , it’s very obvious that the film is moving towards being the one that will be the next best thing in the film , but then the film starts to fall in line with its goals and goals to be the “next big thing”.|0
"I 've seen some Bible-based trash . This one tops it all . To make matters worse , it lasts longer than a century . But most of it just looks like it is . God was not there . And so I went back to my house. There I sat, on the floor between my two rooms, on a bed that was quite large . And then I got to the point where I could actually look into the house . And I think I said, ""No, you don't need to go back! It's not that you don't understand, you just don't know ."|0
This is such a fun and funny movie . Highly entertaining at all angles . It features an outlandish array of characters, and at the same time, is full of real action! The characters in the movie, and the world they inhabit, are very important for every movie. All characters in the movie are there because that is what makes them so special, and it just makes them all look great. We can easily find these characters, but this is one of our favorite characters in the movie. We found this movie so many times, it has made it into a major favorite movie for our time.|0
"Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, Marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. When she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and she becomes beautiful. But the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.Have you ever heard the expression ""as exciting as watching paint dry""? That pretty much sums up Satanik."|1
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date, this year, it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early. Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like ""The Others"") but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end. Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton (Eve), I'm afraid I was not."|1
"Sorry, after watching the credits, I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF actors.Boy was I wrong.The direction and story telling in this POS are terrible. I have never been so insulted by a production.I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this ""film"" but have to say they were conned.If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. These are not only two hours you won't get back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed."|1
"Mr Bean was great fun , i loved it , every episode was really funny , Rowan Atkinson was perfect , it was always fun , and everyone loved the show and every episode was very funny

Wanna know how to make an episode fun? It can be hard to learn everything. But I think I should do it with your help and please do share your ideas with us and I hope to see you in the next episode! The show itself is fun, the show has good characters and funny people but it was fun to learn some things and to learn the characters

What was your favorite episode?"|0
As a serious marathoner, I was seriously disappointed in this film. Its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathoners. Following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners, one senior, one injured runner, and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon, the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is, for lack of a better word, boring. While I did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of Deena Kastor, the brief history of the Boston marathon and marathoning in general, let me emphasize: These were brief!!|1
"Chan-wook Park, you have to hand it to the guy. In my eyes, he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying.Thirst is, essentially, a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the ""rules"" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure, dies and comes back. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with."|1
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors , the sense of camaraderie in their relationships, the emotional closeness and the sense of humor that characterizes this film is very impressive. With so many new films released every year , it’s very important for fans to see this film as a major movie release, as the more they see of the film, the more they want the movie to go out and to be the best. This is exactly why we’re so excited to watch this so far!|0
I read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous Karate Kid installments. Although my favorite is still Karate Kid II, I felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share. Unlike the previous versions, the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path, rather than a male teenager. Maggi finds this a little more challenging, but rises to the occasion. The plot twists are believable and predictable.|1
For Native Mongolian speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha. Too many diversions from the actual history. Terrible terrible subtitle!!! I wonder where and who did that subtitle. It was both in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the English subtitle was soooo bad! Described the one of the greatest leader's life very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with very low budget from 1980's. Honestly, I'm wondering if the film critics of Academy award is that lenient or what?|1
What I miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination, everything is said. It is like a documentary film, but not as good as a documentary, because it is no documentary. A patchwork film without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think. Too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think. I do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny.|1
"I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher was n't involved with this `` movie '' . An interview with Moore and Maher, written at the time, was that the man was involved in that movie and that Moore didn't get an invitation to a movie.

'' The only persons who have ever worked on that movie are the producers, and they also had no idea about it,'' Maher told Bloomberg in a recent article. ""The only people who know it is the guy who made it are the producers, because the people who know it were the people who made it.''"|0
It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it.I think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as My sassy girl, but still good.|1
****Contains Spoilers****As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched for this show to finally come on so that I could see it. I taped it so I could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!I recognize that this was a made-for-TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for TV, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character.|1
Well , to each his own , but I thought Gibson 's Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever been in. And, as it turned out, I was right. As he walked out on me, I couldn't help but wonder if this was a sign of how much this was going to be worth. I couldn't bear to look away from my friends and be reminded of them as well. But, when it was time for him to be back in his own hotel room, it was as though he could have a drink, a chat, or just a chat in private .|0
With great expectations I went to see this film , Spain 's contribution to the Oscar-race this year . Part I: I was there , part II: It turned out to be quite a shock , for I had only seen the part two. In the other part, a few months later, I was in the third and final fight, and I was very impressed that it actually happened . Now I'll not forget that . I was a bit in shock . It was not that difficult . It was just my own personal reaction, because I did not want this to happen to anyone .|0
"This is possibility the worst and most disappointing film I have ever seen. I've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience. This isn't it. The ""acting"" is god awful and the plot non-existent.Here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence.1) A posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite. 2) The best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname ""the brick"". 3) A couple that shag too loudly."|1

Normally I do n't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that I forget almost as soon as I post it but I'll never forget how I would feel if someone posted it. I think it's funny because it's so different than a regular comment I write on a website, and one that I was just wondering if it should be. I have had plenty of posts on my blog since my first one, and I'll never get the chance to reply to any of them on my blog, even if I'm not a member.|0
This film has it's heart in the right place, but unfortunately, it isn't much of a film. It is more of a documentary under the guise of a narrative. Bamako is basically a newspaper op-ed piece put on celluloid. However, your average well-researched op-ed piece is far more cogent and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker is trying to relay to the viewer the hardships of African life, in particular the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, G8, and World Bank, by using the setting of a mock trial against the aforementioned.|1
"Good Film.I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. Thing is the film is named ""To Kill For"". It took a little detective work to find out it's original name.In the UK it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ""ability to sell"". Having seen Final Destination 3 last night it, in my view, should have been a 18.Maybe the fact the delightful, Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18."|1
"The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay I've ever seen. Aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my ""tilt switch"" so often I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had."|1
CAUTION : SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times , the brilliant scenery , richness of the characters and the action was very effective, the main reason for this was the fact that he was not the only one who liked to have a drink with me. As it happens, a few weeks ago, I was asked to go along to the local bar and to drink. It was a good drink for me , because I liked it very much and that is not a bad thing. As the bartender, we drank and then we sat down with the drink for a few minutes and then another drink.|0
This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), they are. This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good, humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the final one of them together.|1
I ca n't remember the series , I believe it may have been `` American Masters '' , but it was still an Indian Masters. The show was created in 1996. It aired on ABC's ABC Television Network between 1997 and 2000. The series first aired on ABC Television in 2000. The show ended with ABC's OWN Television in 2005. It is currently owned by NBC and ABC Television Networks. There are two seasons of this series on ABC's Television Network which aired between 2007 and 2009. It was aired on ABC Television Network since 1997.|0
First I must say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie . I was intrigued and curious to learn about the art of horror and horror movies. I have read horror movies and horror movies before . I think that I would find it useful to take a look and read about them. I did this at a local horror movie store and this one is my favorite. They have about 100 films and the number of films they had at that store is pretty low. I don't know of a movie that I could go back and find another.|0
"This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission.Hilarity ensues.Like the ""Police Academy"" films, the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV. No, it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind, but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes."|1
Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one of her most famous songs. One of the most infamous characters of the first half of the comic series has been killed and has become one of the most well-known and beloved characters of British comics. However, one has to remember that he is one of the most widely known characters in the British comics. His story has been translated into at least 100 languages. He is also featured in many movies. He is played by one of the most famous American comic book series as the most widely-renowned character of comics.|0
A wasted effort. On the surface it's a typical disaster movie: we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the Big Event. However, the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons. Even Sesame Street didn't explain the origins of Mr Snuffleupagus or how Mr Hooper died: we can work it out. Someone thought that entering 'Enron' into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies.|1
As talk-shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it's a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it's not too bad. Other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars.|1
This is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens. I unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel - and I'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig having been a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts. However, she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided.|1
"Awful , awful , awful times a hundred still does n't begin to describe how crappy `` Biggest Loser '' has become , and how I've lost a great many wonderful things , many great times. And many other wonderful things, just wonderful. (1/13/14)

The best I could do, I think, was to let it sink in. I had to tell myself, you see, I was in the business of living the best possible life. And then I thought, 'I can live in the best world I can possibly get'."|0
The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie was ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to Carnosaur except kid in the loader was a bit better acted and action then the adult. The similarities to the Carnosaur movies was rather poor choice in plot line. The only thing that approached good was the beginning with the kids in the jeep. Then the plot went down hill from there. Would have been nice if a different plot had been devised, rather then cloning the earlier movies. The raptor movie should have taken lesson from Jurasic park series in various plots.|1
The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time , but it has always interested me , and I’m not afraid of seeing what lies ahead. That is not a bad thing to do. I enjoy the war and its aftermath so much more than anything you could ever dream up, especially since when Vietnam was the war that ended it. There’s probably a lot of bad news out there today – but for all its flaws it’s just that Vietnam has become the world’s most remembered war since World War II.|0
As is the case with many films of this ilk , my non Catholicism got in the way of my Catholic beliefs, and I had to get up and read the book of Matthew as well. It’s called Matthew 12:9-10 and is based on this Bible, and some of the other Bible studies I’ve read and watched. I was very happy that I read it. I never saw it, but the story of Matthew is very well known, and the best I can write about him, if you ever saw one, is in Matthew 10.|0
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.I got this DVD cheap , with the only one I bought was at the time , it was the one I had on DVD , I got it at home so I didn't get to it , its good but I didn't have a CD.I got it now and it's still good , but I don't know if its worth it. I bought it to see how I was getting at it but I bought a DVD which I got it from a friend of mine.|0
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasn't been given the credit it deserves. Its IMDB rating of 1.7 doesn't do it justice and is, perhaps, due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself. Shot on digital in black and white, the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget. The performances are excellent, particularly that of Gary Lewis who gets better with every role. My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments.|1
My friends and I saw the movie last night in Austin at a showing for AGLIFF ( a film festival) and I have since watched a handful of other films on YouTube, some of them in limited budgets, some for $25 or $100 or $200, and all in limited budgets. All of them were wonderful, and some of them have been good, but not everything is great. We’re not going to list everything for you, but what I want to start with is to start off with some of the best films that you can find on YouTube.|0
A virtual carbon copy of The Cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. I knew the movie was going downhill when I saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. The conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. The acting wasn't as bad as the typical B movie, and there was some believability in their fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession.|1
I would not recommend it whatsoever. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so I couldn't leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn't take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). I have to say I was embarrassed. Filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. Yuck. Actors stunk except The two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. It did smack of Kill Bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers.|1
`` Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable '' , the third in the series , is a magnificent piece of art that makes up a unique collection of specimens and has its own personality. The series, which has been well-reviewed by many critics , is the last in a series that will only be seen in the last three weeks of June. If you are going to see the series on any level, it will have to be for the best. This collection of specimens is not just for the best in every way, and it has to be about what you need to keep up with in your personal life.|0
"Any chance to see Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat, and on that level the film is amusing, but she's horrible miscast as a Hill Billy. Her famous New England enunciation slips through, making lines like, ""I'd better rustle up some Vittles"" pretty ludicrous. She's so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw. The story is an old fashioned melodrama, and there fore, a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff, but this was the staple of American Entertainment well into the 1940's."|1
"The mission to see the movie ""The Cave"" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.The immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. What's he going to look like? Why does he live in a cave? How is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like Alien and Predator and the Relic?"|1
Barbara Payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot Chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who Mrs Payton is desiring to blow the joint with. There is another girl, some sort of peasant slave thing that Burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the Payton tramp.|1
I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success, but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it LOOK LIKE FILM in the first place, it was more about the story the characters and their relationships. Is that not what films are supposed to be about!? But it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests May Thomas is onto something we should pay attention to.|1
This move is absolutely , most certainly one of the greatest films of its , or any other , genre. . . . The film is in the first place as far as I know, of the most famous films of the last fifty years . . . In this year, as I have been saying in previous months , there has been an increasing demand for . . . . And I’ll put in a couple of more examples , I will say. . . . And I will give a couple of examples of some movies from that era . . .|0
I watched this movie on TCM last night, all excited expectation, having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife, who hadn't seen it before, to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot, no cuts, where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam, the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus, and darts among the tanks to cross the road.|1
Like classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting, but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions.|1
This film was very different form the previous films and I had to wonder , `` Where is Ralph Macchio?'' What do you think? Was he there, or wasn't it in the first movie? Cody: The first movie, which was the only one that actually came out, was actually the first film made, the first film that was produced in America, and I have to say, for me, I think the first movie was a little bit in the first year. I had never seen anything before.|0
Okay , enough . Every time I think I 've seen a film that is so misbegotten , so bad , it's all gone. There is no way to put it all together, I just don't see what I'm saying or doing, especially if I want to, but I'm just not prepared for it. I think it is one thing to break a couple of rules, but when you are going to do something you want to do, no matter what , you need to have a reason to do it .|0
If this movie would have been in English, all critics would have trashed it. The language is extremely bad, the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny. After the movie I thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader, at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, on dogs as well...) The story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature Vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time. Of course the public chose Jalla! Jalla!|1
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility. The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens' Scrooge in the way he exercizes control over his employees -- until the Christmas spirit overtakes him. The role is a 'walk in the park' for Greenstreet who had been one of the stage's great Falstaffs when he was part of the Lunts' company.|1
"As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, I tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. This was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. The ""creature feature"" genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone? ), but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying."|1
As if the world needed another Seagal movie . Add a bunch of actors who , well ... are not the only ones making the world's biggest movie, in fact they make a movie that is, frankly, just as good . But the big picture is that these actors are, at any rate, the most important ones, and that means that they have to be respected as much as possible . In this scenario, I want to suggest that there is a real possibility that there will be many more movies that have not been made before.|0
This is a new Barbie movie . The graphics were really good . They made the movie seem partially realistic and a bit more realistic . I didn't know where to look for a picture . I didn't care what the movie was , but it seemed to be better . The story of Barbie is based on a series of photographs of the dolls that you can find on the Internet. Barbie doll is made by Barbie doll company, The Barbie Company. The pictures show that the dolls look like they are made for Barbie doll , and they are made for the real Barbie doll .|0
"As I read the script on-line , I thought `` Capote '' needed a trim . Having just seen it I can't help but think that I may be wrong . I've been trying to create a bash script that can be used like any other bash script. I've created the bash script below :-)

Comparisons to the original series are inevitable . It 's a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1980s , and I don 't have her in my house for much longer . So I will wait and review the rest of the episodes. The only problem is that this is no longer the case. The only difference this show is made to be more interesting is if there is a time frame. The only problem is that it doesn' t seem to make any difference if the series goes on for several seasons , so it is really hard to go back to it .|0
Acting 10 , Script 1 . `` Hurlyburly '' is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared: ' ''I have no intention '' of making'' ' ''Hurryburly''.'' However, it seems that, if there is a better method of producing ''Hurryburly'' , it would be to have some script that would get translated in a way that would ensure that if you do, it does not work at all with any other type of script that comes with that file. This would allow it to produce more interesting results.|0
I think `` category 6 : day of destruction '' was very unrealistic . The digital effects where like a light bulb at night, or you could light the candle and then have it work again. And you have to have the same effect at night. It would also have worked at other times, but it didn't do that. But it's so good to think that people are doing this, that people will take this and have a chance at it. In the last two years, there's only been so many of them , so they're a bit late to it.|0
Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget.|1
Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion.|1
It 's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy-working. While I agree, it is important that we should keep the focus on the most important subjects of this book, such as the film, that we know about and enjoy, but that we should avoid. And what I would do if anyone in the book would have a better grasp on what we are about to say, would be to not focus on the best of them. In my opinion, this chapter isn't quite enough to describe the best parts of the film.|0
"in his descriptions of CAA , platinum card lunches in Hollywood , psychoanalysis , a vacation in Provincetown he never went to , an experience which surprised and impressed him more than a decade earlier, he wrote on a diary :

What it was like to go out that way was a strange one. One day he saw what we were to him. What he saw was a man of action and with a beautiful smile on his face, with the sort of look that would make me wonder just how much money I might have made had I been willing to help him on a rough road."|0
"Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people, only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table, and for the sake of revenge, his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson), who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.While I know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock, ""Nurse Sherri"" is really not all that bad."|1
Happy 25th Birthday to Valley Girl ! Great soundtrack , plausible story , wonderful performances ... captures the spirit of this great band. It is a very special and memorable band, and will be an absolute surprise to anyone who isn't in the know. It is always a joy to hear all of the songs of the same band! The only thing the band has changed so much is its name, and the band is all about this name. It's a great time to remember and remember all of the bands of Valley Girl. It's a time to remember and remember and remember everything.|0
My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound.|1
Drawn by Pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: Episode one was even better than I expected and from everything I had heard about it, I expected quite a lot. I am very impressed with the actors already. The father was creepy and played perfectly. The little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotion. The animation was superb. The cinematography was amazing, each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly.|1
"eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the ""real"" one.Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a video game into question even up to the end."|1
First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So of course, I have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie. But as I began to watch this film, I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version from the early 1970s, though shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the book's author attended school, and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book, lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters.|1
This is one of the most laughably bad films I 've ever seen . I can not believe whoever wrote this, it's a terrible, dreadful movie. But this is the greatest and most important thing I have seen of any film to- date, a really great film. And I know I've never told anyone this film was great. It is the greatest thing ever made. And it is so. I can't believe anyone made this. But this film was written and directed by a writer with a very very big responsibility. And it was great.|0
"Oh what a disappointment this movie is. I can't believe it was directed by Wajda. There's practically no plot and 90% of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen, weakly trying to interact with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes right at the end, but by that time I simply stopped caring while trying to suppress my yawns.Almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, which is supposed to convey the feeling of ""personal immediacy"" but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie."|1
This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. When wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil' Pimp must lay down for his homies.The animation isn't very good in this.|1
Larry Bishop , the Writer/Actor/Director , focuses too heavily on the camera , music , and visuals . The film's theme is not only how to get a picture of a character, but the art of making them look like a person. In the movie, she takes the time to paint a character in a different way . The characters are supposed to look like people. . The art of making them look like an object, not like a person. . . . The film's title describes the actor as a woman who comes to visit her friends and family.|0
Underwoods goofy story about a young man(Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, Arquette is annoying throughout, Ian Nicholas was nonexistent, Macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable.|1
I 'd heard about this movie , but did n't see it until my daughter , who saw it on tv , saw it . I know I have watched it twice , but I know nothing about it till I read about it by her and I found it was not her movie but the movie in the tv book where the movie of a woman in her mid 20's who is in the US , has been there for a long time ! ive seen and I think it is one of her favorite films . ive watched it and i loved every single thing the movie is about.|0
Let me first state that I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this film . For the most part the actors are great, but I had no interest in working with actors who were more mature than most other actors. My main interest in this film is to explore the emotional and social side of the movie, rather than focusing on how they can make a film from a script. They are still very talented actors who could make a great movie for a short time, especially with the budget of an actor who does not understand the subject of the movie and is still going to make that film.|0
"Three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. The one-hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over. I have seen other segments of the ""Dekalog"" but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure.The film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder. Obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen (at least in the short 1-hr version of Dekalog 5)."|1
"...and in this series, I've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco, who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series his one-liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with inane catchphrases. Remember Rachel, ""Xena, the Warrior Princess"", and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for TV."|1
"This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the ""war is hell"" cliché, underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel, who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece."|1
"`` Admissions '' is a fine drama even though they 're are some problems with the ending .

"this is one of the stupidest movies ever , not THE stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest . I am not trying to explain how it was, but I wanted to show how I could use it as a reference . In the beginning the movies were made by me and I took a couple of the pictures of them , after that I put some photos of my life on my screen. After that I had to write out some details about how I got this movie. i am trying to understand how it is that a person can be a ""good guy"" when they ""lives with"" him."|0
All the reviewers are making one big mistake . This movie was not suppose to be taken seriously.It was made as a movie as a movie, not in a good way. In fact, there is no doubt about this movie. The only thing that made the movie a bit better was its performance. I would have expected the performances to be great.But, as I was saying, it wasn’t, and that is not what this movie was, but you know it. The acting was terrible, the cinematography was terrible, the sound quality was terrible.|0
I always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time . I 've always been intrigued. I wanted to know more about this thing and it was the first time I saw it with my son. I 've been in love for over a decade and have been hooked for more than a few years now. But I haven't been able to look at the images that have made my family so happy and I have to wonder what I am going to do with them. I am hoping to learn some things from him.|0
I went to this film full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors headed up by Sir Ben I thought this is going to be a little treat.Oh how I felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled. That I had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I am not particularly hard to please comedically - high or low brow - but there really is not one laugh in this film.2.|1
I did n't really HATE Mirrormask . I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals . The story of Mirrormask goes all too much in the beginning to make it feel just like an action adventure movie . And even though I did feel pretty good about this one, it also felt a little bit slow to read . So I did feel a little bit more in-between things , I did actually have a lot of fun in it . But it was so much more solid . And that was my fault for doing that .|0
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas. Whatever happens, when such a woman ages, and loses her charm and mystique? Well, for those who are interested, watch this film. One: Okin, is successful as a money-lender, but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. Okin doesn't have any children, but the other do. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited.|1
Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film . It was very very rushed , as I suppose you couldnt get it right . This is a bit different from the video , the first part is very realistic and does not take into account time in the video . I would have expected more action . In terms of time , the action of the movie is very realistic. Also, I think you should have noticed that the screen size of the trailer does not allow for some space in between the screen and the character, this makes the gameplay quite difficult.|0
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential, but nothing more, because boy did the filmmakers botch it. The plot is practically incomprehensible, the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a trade rat? Worst of all, though, this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes; plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark-haired woman... well, the blond girl was pretty too, but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette.|1
"My son Adam (5 years old) is a big Scooby Doo fan. He like this film a lot. He particularly liked when the Loch Ness monster tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. The vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters.Having seen the ""Vampire Rock"" film first, this, not surprisingly, was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting.Few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the TV cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children. You either like this or love it."|1
I HATE MOVIES THAT END LIKE THIS ! ! ! ! This 16mm disaster is full of clichés , stereotypical clichés from all over the globe , and most of the time these clichés don't come true , but are true . I do agree with you , but I have to admit that I hate this project ! ! ! ! ! I have tried to fix everything in this project , so I have to go back to how I am now , if I ever get to the second project . But to make the other two projects , I have gone back to how I made them and how I have gone back !|0
Buyer beware. The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description. The movie was shot in color but you wouldn't know it for the first 25 minutes or so. The print that is used is so faded and decrepit that it appears almost sepia toned. After 30 minutes some color seeps back into the print but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. Keep in mind, even at it's best the color is pale and washed out. It looks like the print was recorded off a television that wasn't getting the best reception.|1
Al Pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity . But when he was brought into the room for the second time when I was playing this guy, it was all about his appearance. . In this case, I'm a guy who has had a tough time finding work and has been given a new life. If there is any chance he'll get back to his old form, it's that he'll never work again. . It's always nice to be able to say that you didn't see that he made a big mistake.|0
"this is one of my favorite movies ever ! along with casablanca and cannibal holocaust , this is near perfect and I can't wait to see it at least in cinemas, so if I was to come see this in theatres I will have an idea about it and then I will be able to watch it at my local cinemas as well as in the US. That's my favorite movie at the moment ! Thanks again for all the great reviews and suggestions! This is the last of a long line of ""cinemas with the best food and booze in Europe"" that I've seen, I have to admit."|0
This movie was made on a relatively small budget ( 10-20 million dollars ? ) with almost no promotion at all. The movie's budget was limited by the amount of money it spent on advertising (which was just enough to give it a good chance.) In the end, it was sold to a couple of film pros who decided to promote it as something more than a video game, which was their choice. It's not entirely clear what the problem may have been in the original film, but it might have been solved with the movie itself, as there were no changes made to the game.|0
"Its gon na be hard to make this fill 10 lines .... But ill give it a try ( just like you did it to me and it'll have to work) ....

You can take a look at this post and try it out. It will help you make a more useful and productive video. It is a great tool for teaching, and it helps to keep students engaged and motivated as they become more successful. Good tip for those who are going to be looking for more videos in the comments. Many of you have been looking at my videos and want to share them with me."|0
"This film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. Why introduce Rachel, for instance? She has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her ""Follow Me"" truck to run wild and crash into Dorinda's fence. That has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. Another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a B-26 or an A-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place."|1
"Would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? My eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. My ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. Then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. It's formulaic every step of the way. Talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the ""dreams can come true"" schtick?"|1
"That 's how I was when I walked ( staggered ) out of this `` film '' . I could not even stand up and walk in the room. I felt like I was in charge of all the activities that went into a movie, and that I had done, and that I had never done before. This was different from me. It was my role. In the back, I told you about it. There was a woman in the back. She stood right in front of the back door and looked at me. She said, ""Why do you do that?"""|0
Everyone knows that late night movies are n't Oscar contenders . Fine . I mean I 'll admit that I'm not a huge favorite of mine . . but a lot of things about movies seem pretty good . . . I know I haven't been a star . . . I just don't buy anything except popcorn . . . I'm still a fan of Disney . . I have nothing against the Disney movies . . .

Next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is ... oh yes , `` Graduation Day '' ! All right then! Let's get on to the next part. This week we'll take a look at the story. In the beginning, I made a mistake and wanted to get back into my writing. It wasn't for real. I was trying to write the story, it was a little awkward, the story I had to try to get across in different ways. The first thing I did was get back in to my writing, read the story and it turned out a bit too hard.|0
Begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for Fonda, Stanwyck, and the supporting cast.Never saw this one before - am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs over the threshold. If I continue watching, it will be just to see if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the dumper.But after reading the other viewer comments, I'm not very optimistic.The opening ski scenes were enough to put me off my lunch. The voice-overs were obviously done in a sound studio, and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous.|1
Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He's some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars.|1
When I stepped into the theater , I thought this was going to be a great movie . And I had never thought anything could be more beautiful . . . . And I wanted to see it again because of the fact that this was a theater I was going to see more of than anyone else in the world . . . and I wanted to know how this movie would feel. There were two films in it , which I found fascinating as I had been watching them , and I don’t blame you for going to see these films every time you are in the theater .|0
I know it 's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I am happy to agree with it - and as someone who does not make a lot of comments, this movie is definitely worth seeing. I don't actually think I'm very well prepared to make a movie, although I can be a little vague on what you mean. But that is beside the point! There's a lot of work to be done and we should be prepared for it. I know it's a fairly slow movie, so I'd like to see it again.|0
"Please ... if anybody gets the chance to read this BEFORE watching the movie , if it can be called . A:

This is a bad question and it can be answered with a better one if you have already read the book. In the book, you read (1) How to be a good teacher, (2) What should you learn from this, and how should you practice in the future. Here is the complete book (1) The Art of Learning. This book is a good resource for getting your learning points right."|0
"I cant believe it ! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carry in the film has a good ending ! Thankyou ! The first part is pretty awesome :D
The second part is pretty amazing, but is it a better ending than that in the previous one ? Is it good or bad? That's it for today! If you'd like to know more about this movie, you can visit the DVD and the website. I'll be sure to do some more research as soon as I've done that, and I hope to have it finished by the weekend."|0
Oh, dear! This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's unbelievably repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down, running round screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. I wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good, but it isn't; the main character Phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the Tracker, he never gets hit, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him.|1
"""Jefferson in Paris"" is a truly confounding film. It presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unflattering light possible, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins. This is the way he was, the film seems to say. End of sentence, end of movie, the door's behind you.After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson proceeds to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underused Simon Callow)."|1
"This movie was beyond awful, it was a pimple on the a*s of the movie industry. I know that every movie can't be a hit or for that matter even average, but the responsible parties that got together for this epic dud, should have been able to see that they had a ticking time bomb on their hands. I can't help but think that the cast would get together in between scenes and console each other for being in such a massive heap of dung. I can hear it now, ""You getting' paid?"""|1
I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER doing another `` Biblical '' film again , if Noah 's Ark is on the menu. And if there's still no proof that there's even one, that it was not built by anyone else but God or some other god. What the Bible says about the Ark is true. Noah had an Ark and the Ark of the Covenant. It was also written in Hebrew. I have the Ark but the Hebrews. It was written from the time Noah's Ark was built until the day it was taken out. The Old Testament.|0
As I was flipping through the channel I came to a channel 124 . It is an urban channel . It is one of our favorites . It is also one of the top cities for the city of Baltimore, and it was the #2 in the U.S. Best of the Best . It is one of the first ones to be recorded on television . It is one of the earliest ones in the world that can still record and play a tune, so it is probably the most popular choice for the music. . . . One of the first people to show some of the videos for the series .|0
"I 'm not a movie snob . I 've liked lots of movies that critics hate , and I 've always disliked them when they 're released. I 've liked them on TV too , but the movie was one of my favourites and I felt I was a bit more of a stand out person . . . I'm just saying that I 're not a ""movie snob"" or a ""movie snob""

There are two reasons to dislike them, either they 're really bad or they're just bad, and you're going to find out which one is the worst."|0
This film follows the life of a great guitar player , who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly on his music. It is here where he gets a little bit confused and comes up with a strange name for himself. But what is “bigging” and what is “biggin’?” It means that “bigging” means that you are putting on a band that is big. So, how about “biging” and what are those terms? The main thing that we all want to see is the big guitar player. So, what is the name of this thing?|0
being a fan of Bela Lugosi , Boris Karloff , and Lon Chaney Jr i had to see this.what tripe is it to use it, and what it could do to you and others? You need to take a step back, and take an even more important step, in order to understand and make decisions for yourself. You're not thinking of yourself as someone you know you're not, but you are thinking of this as a conversation. You have to have the courage to do so, or you will lose yourself.|0
Sorry I could n't disagree more , with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry-on-Off-Carry-on-Off-All-Of-Anywhere. I've had it done for me for too long - it just doesn't help. I've had that said many times on the forums , but this post makes no sense. I want to go back and post again, and again I hope I can get it all done for you . You have a great blog . I wish you a wonderful, fun, and exciting trip . I hope you enjoyed! I think it was a good post.|0
What can I say about a movie as bad as this? The people who made this movie, didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic. You never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. And the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. At many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a TIE fighter flying over! I couldn't believe that when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in.|1
I must admit, ashamed though I am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. Nine years after first viewing Stephen King's frightening story however I have now come to my senses, and am able to assess Fritz Kiersch's work more reasonably.Indeed King's tale of a small Nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid.|1
"First of all , I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my life and I am not really sure what your take on this. I hope you can understand why my answer is so important to anyone who is considering this project. However , as I said before and you know what I mean:

In the beginning we were in love. It wasn't until the beginning of our relationship which was the day before that I started to wonder if our relationship had anything to do with what was really going on."|0
I guess this is the first time I have seen a Roscoe 'Fatty ' Arbuckle movie . I really liked it . Now I have no problem with being fat but I do like it . It's a very different story from the two other movies that I have seen. I really liked it, it was very entertaining. I have also seen other movies that this movie has done so well that I'm very curious to see. I have a lot of fun with this movie in the future and it has been so successful! I really liked it and I also had an awesome time with it.|0
I 've enjoyed this movie ever since I first saw it in the theatre . Some movies have a cast of actors and actresses. Others I've seen in my life, so it's not something new to me. I just wanted to say thank you for the great experience that you have given us. I have no doubt there will be many more great movies that you will love. But, you may also want to know that I didn't intend for you to leave. I didn't think that I would. There is an important part of this book.|0
In addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film ( imagine giving a camcorder to the TV) but it's the only one released with a little extra work, it does have a big, beautiful, well-written scene. You may want to pick up the book, it should have some pages that tell you all about the series but I'm not sure about the characters. You should get into some detail about where they are set up in the story but this is the only book I've found that has some details.|0
The Love Letter is one of my all-time favorite books , so naturally I was skeptical when I heard it, but it finally made me come up with the name! It’s so funny! The title is a bit misleading but it really is a great read for kids, it’s a little bit off the mark but I love the way it makes you know it’s a real book! The love letter is a great addition to any book as you can read it in its entirety at any time, and I hope you’re reading it now!|0
Buyer beware . The Alpha Video release uses a print that defies description . The movie was shot in color, but the story was in black and black and black and black and blue and white and green and blue . The film had to be shot in white . The color was black because the movie would be black if the color had been shot in white but black if it had been shot in black . The story would have to be shot in black because the film was black . . . . . . . . . . ._ . . . ._ . .|0
I 'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie . ( I 'm not counting super bug budget , no. but I can tell you that the one that I love the best I saw is a comic based on a comic strip I was sent to pay for with a friend to work on with , which I had written years ago , and still has it up to date . but I really don' t really like it anymore , and that was a very good move . I 'm glad I got it up to date for you ,' and now I can't be more excited about it .|0
"While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that I was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy. A few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh: ""I ate a rabbit."" ""I TOLD you she was possessed!"" ""Are you telling me the Devil is in my daughter?! ""There are many, many more, but you must discover these for yourself - if you dare.The story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even the Priest)."|1
"The writers missed so many opportunities and created so many plot holes.Example : When Dave retrieved his keyboard from the garage, he had to leave a message on his phone. This was to tell him about what had happened to the keyboard that he needed. He went to the window and opened it, and after opening the screen he had to scroll back to page 13, and there he was reading the words ""Dave and I were working on the keyboard a while back, and now I want to read more."""|0
This movie tries to be more than it is. First of all, the acting is horrible. You have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. The plot is quite interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. If this weren't bad enough, some guy named Count de Sade is living there as well. He lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. Anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs.|1
The animal-eating ( geek ) scenes were not as bad as you would think . After having watched Mondo Cane for the last 10 years . I found myself doing a bit of what you are thinking about the other day. You said that if it wasn't a “lion” in the animal-eating scenes it would be because they were in the right place and you were just talking about the animals. I think it was an attempt at making the scenes look “lion” . Now I’ve seen a few of your other posts. This is something you should know.|0
To think this film was made the year I was born . To think people are still having their constitutional rights. To think it was produced the year the world was turned. To think we are still fighting over who has a say in it. So, in the process of being the first film I've ever made, I've not had a chance to tell people, I want to tell them what I think. I do, as a filmmaker, want to help people in the film, but, I'm not a filmmaker who has ever been a filmmaker, and I've always been.|0
"So me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the Scarecrow series!?! Keep in mind that this is not just Scarecrow Three; this is, Scarecrow: Gone Wild. Now both of us had seen to the first two Scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job. Let's start with the cover of the DVD first. First we notice a picture of Ken Shamrock (""The World's Most Dangerous Man"") on the cover."|1
I 'm so glad he was n't alive to see this . This movie is a debauchery of his work. If I could get a movie for free I'd do this, but I want to pay for it. I want it in theaters in NYC for the first time and for the second time. I've seen most of them, but they have a few different ones that will come out and be good for the money. If it's free and I don't get any good money I'm going to go back to the theater and go see it.|0
Almost missed it . While visiting friends in Philadelphia sometime in the early 1980 ` s , I was channeling a new band with a very new name. The band was a big influence in the early ' 's , and at that time it seemed like it could become the band that could play a show on stage. I had only been in a band in the s with this name, but I was intrigued and I began to wonder what was the purpose for this band. I soon found out. I wanted to write my name down, but I also found it very difficult to remember my own name.|0
"If you have ever shopped at Wal-Mart, then you probably know about the $5 DVD bin that sits by the electronics department. Well, that is where I found this movie. However, I was tricked! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even listed her name as a ""headliner"". I picked it up thinking, ""Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie?!?!"" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool Sandra Bullock movie."|1
SPOILER ALERT ! Do n't read on unless you 're prepared for some spoilers.I think this film had a lot to do with that one. As you can probably tell from the article above I have not seen anything like this before in films. If you watch the trailer you will find some of the scenes that I saw. In fact they were only filmed for a limited time. You can view this film in its entirety here . I have no idea what the rest of the films have to do with it . . .|0
Now , the sci-fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films ( House of the dead 2 , which I'll share in this list). If you haven't seen the movies, please do not read this, and if you have, or if you don't, don't be surprised when we see these films. You can see some of the films I have included on my Youtube page, here and here in this list. And it is the most popular one. I'll include the list again if you want to get a better look at the film series.|0

Ham-handed homage to honest hacking . Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography , until it went to the dark side, and was replaced by the more serious , where it would come into the top 10 by the end of the first decade of the century. When the band returned to the dark side, however, its style was very much different. If you were interested in finding out more about the bands they had played, you should go here to listen to our latest review, which we’ll take up here.|0
I was rather disappointed . The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan , from the first 5 mins to the last 5-5-5-5. I have to admit I liked it really, the characters were a bit dull, but they have made me feel the game was fun, but I really wanted to play it on another platform. I think it will be interesting when it becomes official so we can try some new styles. I can say that the second episode is still quite nice, but not as good as the third. However, you can also say that the story is better.|0
When you see Barry Corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash. Guess which category SOLO falls into. Apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, WEAPON, SOLO stars Mario Van Peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination. He hides out in a Mexican village, obviously to save money on locations and extras. Paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, I suspect. William Sadler is along for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy Van Peebles.|1
RIFIFI ( Jules Dassin - France 1955 ) To me , it seems a very risky idea to attempt a radical change to your life as a student of medicine. I'm afraid if you are able to make these changes you will have the same results. There is a huge gap between how you are going to treat the body and the symptoms of disease. You have already been trained in the fields of medicine and psychiatry. You know that it may be possible to get your blood into your veins, your arteries, your organs and so on.|0
Great party movie , following the adventures of Bill & Tom , two high school buddies at opposite ends of the world. Their lives have changed since then. Now, they must decide how to live their own lives and in turn they will lead their friends in different paths. If we are to make a living, we must find ways of connecting with ourselves and the other people. This is the best way, and one that might be a great idea. In the next article, I would like to talk about the life stories that I tell about myself in this blog.|0
I saw this on a screener DVD a couple months before it was released.I liked the main characters and the backstory in a lot of ways. I'm not sure how it's actually done.But I'm going to put it on a DVD, as I feel that I have a better chance at it than I do right now.I am very excited about the ending, but I don't feel like the main characters are there to read.I don't like the first half of the book as much as I would like the second.|0
What can I say about a movie as bad as this ? The people who made this movie , did they really know what would be best ? If this is an example , , then how do we know how bad it should be , and how far to go? How far will we go to see this movie, if there is such an example. The movie you are viewing, I would say, looks good. However if it looks like you really don't think this will be good for you, then it's probably not good.|0
Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. It features only two actors in a single set, but never loses your attention. The set design is imaginative and troubling, the staging of scenes maintains your attention, while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is outstanding, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.I first saw this film in 1991, soon after it came out on video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. It should be seen, though.|1
This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. The acting atrocious, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialog excruciating, and even the weapons seem sub-par.|1
"UK-born Australian helmer Alex Frayne calls for attention with his strange , necessitating a meticulous read , visually stunning Modernist . “I think it would be easy to put it into words” Frayne said, ""I’m a realist. A realist’s the way to be.”

He’s also a serious critic of government policies which he argues is in direct contradiction to his realist approach to life, and one he has taken a different tack on his blog. Frayne, who has a PhD in philosophy, is a leading expert in politics."|0
"This is the kind of movie which is loved by 50-year old schoolteachers and people who consider themselves aware in social issues - but really haven´t got a clue. The actors - I think all of them are amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of cliches and stupidities that they can´t save it.Worst of all though is the scool cabaret that the kids are working on - brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school. The lyric to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast-translation 2.30 in the morning: ""I´m the dwarf of society, an emotionally crippled individual."|1
"I cant go for long describing this tittle , simply because I do not feel strong about it . I do not want to put too much into it . Let me know if there is anything I want to say , and if you would like to be the one to send us some of what he has to say , thanks

That is the way things should be . But for some reason I am a bit worried by it , and I cannot find it in my head . Maybe it is because I am too old to find it . ."|0
"For anyone who has ever sought happiness , `` Half Empty '' is a must-see . This original cross- cultural novel has been adapted and re-written by some of the greatest novelists, and has gained worldwide critical reception . In this review, I will be highlighting two new books:

The book was originally published in 1987, and the original version, with the title ``Half Empty'' but with a slightly altered style, was released in 2009. This book was re-released as a book in 2008. The title is adapted and re-re-created as a work of literature."|0
This homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by Edgar Allan Poe. It tells of a fellow survivor whose life is filled with the ghost of another man and how he ended up living with a corpse. The film is a sequel to a 2002 film based on the original. It was produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and the last two years of production have seen a significant release. It was the second sequel to the original Disney animated film, the first was a very similar movie to it, but only with a slightly different plot.|0
Wesley Snipes latest straight to video film is a convoluted mess , horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal 's latest works. Snipes and I are in for a very long week of horror movies in the works, so we're here to talk about some of these movies we've been watching over the past few years, as well as the new ones that you might expect to find in your next horror movie. I'll let you know if there's any content coming out of this project, or if you have the chance to see the new one for yourself.|0
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. I watched this not expecting too much from it. The Fact is that the cast were superb, Especially The lead Teen Female. The dark sides of them all came through, all were messed up in an not obvious way. There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is, is a strong drama/thriller.|1
"""Hey, I didn't order no cab!"" ""Yeah, well you got one..."" What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for America's TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack's exterior, you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled...all in the same episode."|1
One of the last films DIRECTED by Lionel Barrymore , `` Ten Cents a Dance '' stars Barbara Stanwyck as a young black woman who is forced to make the difficult choices for herself after falling in love with a handsome black woman. `` Ten cents a dance '' is about the story of two little girls that meet when they meet a black woman. `` Ten cents on a song '' is the theme of the movie, about two young black girls living together. `` The black girl who falls in love with the black girl is a girl with a white woman.|0
"The first time I saw this was when I was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. I didn't.The second time I saw this was last night on TV. It still sucks.As a love story this sucks. As having Julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. To me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. She had no tough shell to her. She wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. Her ""HOOKER"" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond."|1
I had to watch this movie for a film class, I suffered the whole time through. I am not Asian but was still greatly offended by this film. The film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (Rex Harrison isn't even Asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. The banning of the film in Thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of Asians. In addition, there has been critical attention given to Biography of Anna. Many critics argue that Anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner.|1
This is another Alien imitation and not a very good one at that.Replace outer space with the South African desert and you'll discover a little bit of your world in a lot of places, so why should you not try and make a mistake when you just need to make a mistake in this place?So, what's next? So you have this place, and you've been here for the last twenty years, and you see that this place has been transformed into something called the South African desert. What you are seeing in this desert is a beautiful desert.|0
First of all , I personally adore Demons and Demons 2 , I saw them although it was hard to find them at the time so I have a list of them as well that I had to have them at home in the car park. They looked great on TV but on the PS4 this one is a bit over the top so if you were to take them at your own convenience , you'll love how they looked and I've been looking for them in PS4 too. If it is your first time playing Demons , then feel free to drop in for me and give me a link.|0
I can't knock this film too terribly, because it's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad, or 'campy' if you prefer. Anyway, many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are, but often simply for the cheese factor. Watch the 'space invaders' game, actually played as real-life! Scratch your head at the bumbling robots...oh, the wackyness! And watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the 'time warp'!|1
I tried watching this movie, but I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part.|1
Sheltered young woman, home-schooled and possibly quite gifted, harbors a disturbed, overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit, asking for a divorce. Directed by celebrated cinematographer William A. Fraker, this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in: each shot is composed for the utmost style, but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight, gripping narrative. Fraker (and his cinematographer, László Kovács) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones, giving the picture a burnished, tableaux feel.|1
Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made. Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time, but I don't really like the films he's directed of what I've seen (with the exception of this and Affliction), but this is an amazing, disturbing, and highly 3-dimensional character study. It follows the life of Yukio Mishima, Japan's most celebrated writer, combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories. I don't know how, but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way.|1
I just can not emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is . Justthe memory of this movie right now is wonderful . It's the only thing that keeps it going all day and night and day. It's so cute . . . I am going to be back soon to see it every night . . This is a movie that we all need to experience. It's just the best movie of all time. I am so glad I am able to stay in the theater and watch it. I love that it has the perfect sound.|0
"Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for westerns in 1953 . Guy Madison leads the band for the band for the biggest hit of their career. In addition, Madison plays the lead vocalist for the song ""Gone With the Wind,"" which they sang in the film ""The River."" ""The Story"" and ""Love Boat,"" ""Love Boat,"" were the first commercial successes of the band's second year with the band and it was a major moment for the band's new sound."|0
This film is a very beautiful and slow film . There is nothing Hollywood about it . It is very beautiful . I have to say there are a lot of very beautiful movies I have seen in the past 20 years . They have made a great movie . You are very lucky that I haven't watched this movie . But I know there is more to be seen in the next 30 years . I think there has to be . You are a very lucky man . To have seen a really great movie . I don't know if I will .|0
TART is the worst movie I 've seen this year , and that includes both the Affleck/J.Lo bomb GIGLI and the Ben Stiller disaster. It is about a young girl, and it doesn't seem to be the most interesting thing in the entire film. It does get a little boring for a while and then ends up as the only good story in the entire book, though. It's great for a few reasons , though. First of all, the film is well done. And, I was a little disappointed when I saw it in the theaters last weekend.|0
I've never written a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid WWII historian, I don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was. Carbines with Korean War bayonet lugs, K98k's missing cleaning rodes and sight hoods, German uniforms that didn't exist, the list could go on forever. Added that it's loaded with flaws, has literally no plot or climax, and acting on par with your local high school theater.|1
Stay FAR AWAY from this film . The fact that you 're reading reviews tells me you may have already read it . So, if you 've never read my review, then this will do the trick . I think it is important to review your story because if it's not your style then you need to take your time to read it. It may seem like you are reviewing a lot of material, but you have to read it for it to be believed and not believe. If you are reviewing it as an author you are missing out on more opportunities to have a good review.|0
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind . The trauma , the suspense is a bit overblown. The characters are cute and they are likable . It is so much more than an anime movie but for the most part they are likable . There are many different ways they could have played this series so I'm going to take it as an example to show you a movie with these characters and I'm going to go into more detail if you haven't seen it. I hope this helps someone else who wants to learn more about the characters and their story .|0
To put it simply , this was a pompous piece of canine poopie . Overly stagey and everyone being the other side of the line. I was in such a bad mood that I didn't try to explain it. I didn't get it. No I didn't know how to go about it but I did. I can do a lot of things. Just like in the movies, it wasn't like a pig was a human being. Anyway I have to say I am very pleased with this blog. I love it.|0
Mild spoilers below.The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed . From the opening scene (see here), the film shows a young girl, a couple of boys, and her uncle, who falls in love with a boy he’s seen in a long time. He takes her in the form of his uncle and they are introduced by him to a young man in his own right, and they learn that the boy will be the same age as the girl, but that the girl won’t look like her uncle.|0
"Now I'm a big animation fan -- love Svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so I had high hopes for this one. Then I came on IMDb and paused --- I'm always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on IMDb. Here we've got another --- a bunch of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real low ones. I'm also suspicious of 10s with the word ""visionary"" in them. Sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them."|1
"I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary , then later felt like I did more than I should. I made it clear at the time to myself, ""This will be my next post . If this post still exists, it will have to do."" If I posted a comment at the bottom of the article , then I will post it , but if I did post it with more than my intended audience . If I do this with a comment of any length , I will be removed from the comments and replaced."|0
"Just awful. It's almost unbelievable that, with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, such a plodding, passionless mishmash could result. But that's television for you -- filler between commercials. The first warning signal sounds from the fussiness of the period re-creation, which screams ""1928"" in banner type. Flivvers and touring cars, fedoras and waistcoats, cloches and speakeasy jazz (jarringly played) -- with all the attention paid to pointless, arty detail, the important matters get ignored.Like narrative clarity, or plausibility, or competent writing and acting."|1
I've never understood this type of spoof movies. You get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart-jokes and such. We've seen it many, many times, and it's never really been funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre, though I honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots.|1
"From the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible HERCULES (1983), comes its even more preposterous (read goofier) sequel: right off the bat, we get another unwieldy ""beginning of time"" prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film! ; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a SUPERMAN-like scrolling credits sequence. Narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal Zeus' seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts  a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with Planet Earth!"|1
"Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing, this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot ""Thirst"" - laughter. Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals. It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful, and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady, who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong."|1
I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don't think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case.|1
"This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to watch it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it?"" It's that bad."|1
Homecoming; what a HUGE disappointment!! After reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush!!!!!) I couldn't wait to see this. It started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, though, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that I didn't need to see (I can just watch some good old Aussie comedy for that!). There was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary.|1
This was one of the few Norwegian movies I actually looked forward too see. It started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.Norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but I had a good feeling about this one. Even thou I'm not interested in football I wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up.|1
I agree with all aforementioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. It's always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. I would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we're requesting Smart Series That Never Got a Chance...How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list...Middle Ages or Frank's Place.|1
Well , great costumes and a wonderful ` feel ' for Pre WWII Italy . But what happened here ? We do not think there are any pre-1947 or Pre-1947 Italy costumes that would be considered pre-1947 or pre-1945 in any way, shape or form. It does not seem possible to create costumes that would make any sense. So how is it going to look for costumes that would make it possible to make pre-1945 costumes ? I know that many of the pre-1945 costumes do not have the name of the costume. So we do not know for sure how the costumes fit in the Pre-1945 or Pre-1945 costumes.|0
I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed by the accuracy and honesty in the portrayal of Western and Japanese ideologies colliding. Whoever wrote the screenplay, and directed this film must have a good knowledge of what it's like to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part I thought was too Hollywood-y was when Tom Selleck's character kisses the woman in the middle of her office and she lets him. Public displays of affection are not really acceptable here. Finally a movie that highlights the true 'gaijin' experience!|1
This horror tale takes place in the Namib Desert of Africa . A Canadian systems analyst , Zach Straker (born April 24, 1996) is a professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Kingdom and Australia and has worked for many years in the field of child development. In the early 2000s, as the United Nations World Conference on Sustainable Development led the development of technology to tackle the problems of infant mortality and health, he was the first to use technology to assist in the diagnosis of cancer, and to provide the first report in this field.|0
"""Mr. Bug Goes To Town"" was the last major achievement the Fleischer studios produced. The quality of the Superman series produced at the same time is evident in this extraordinary film.The music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and Hoagy Carmichael (with assistance by Flieshcer veteran Sammy Timberg are quite good, but not as much as the scoring of the picture by Leigh Harline who also scored Snow White for Disney. Harline's ""atmospheric music"" is superb, and a treat for the ears.The layout and staging of the picture was years ahead of it's time, and once again the Fleischer's background artists outdid themselves."|1
WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS ! 'Rock Star ' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen . This is the film which I like to watch whenever I am on a trip. It is a very cool movie and I can't wait to get back on that trip and see where it goes from there. There are some songs in there that we do not have any knowledge about but we have learned to do the songs that the movies are supposed to do. One of the songs is called 'Rock Star '.|0
I am not understanding why people are praising this movie . I did n't like it at all . I thought it was an action movie but this is the first time I'm seen and I watched this movie and I can't find any explanation why this is. I watched it a lot of times it was funny , so I'm looking to rewatch it again . I'm pretty sure it is the same movie you were talking about, but the animation looks a little off for me. Thanks for reading. _________________This video may contain nudity and I will not use it to show a person's feelings.|0
I watched this film not knowing anything about it. I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The plot is enthralling and intelligent, the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change. Some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple. I am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this.|1
Well, I've just seen Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and-despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason-I found plenty to laugh at. Like when Buster orders molasses from butcher boy Fatty, Fatty makes Buster come back to pay, Buster says he put it in the bucket that has the molasses, Fatty dumps molasses in Buster's hat and takes money, Buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck, Fatty attempts to remove it while molasses fall to floor, Buster's feet are now stuck on floor and so on.|1
"This is probably the best movie from director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown by foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all of the Latin American countries, poverty and a survival instinct. The most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans, or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a ""dog eat dog"" society many times falling into the gap of delinquency, prostitution and crime. Very well acted and with a ""no frills"" approach, this movie will get to you, Great story plot, a must have movie on anybody's collection."|1
Are you kidding me ? The music was SO LOUD in this show I could often not even hear the vocals. They sounded like I wasn't doing anything, even when the singer was standing on the podium, as if they were there to listen to me. That was the first time I saw the artist on the stage. It was as if the music was being played so I couldn't understand what was being said. In my head, I heard the vocals in my own head, that were my own music.|0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie . What is even more stupid is that the director is not going to give us the right to go to the movies. In this situation the only thing that's wrong is that the only thing that you can do is go to the movie, go and watch. That is the only thing you can do now is go to the movie, and then go to the movie and watch. Now, you don't need to watch the movie because you have the movie to watch, so you are not the only one that watches a movie.|0
Yes, I spelled that right. This movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. From the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. You could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably. It's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre.|1
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson . Ms. Merkerson is a famous actor of the silent era who has made his name as a director, actor and director in the United States and Italy. She received an award for Best Actor at the National Film and TV Awards in 1989. Merkerson's appearance on television shows, movies and games made her one of the most famous actors in the cinema industry. She was chosen as one of the eight actresses who were nominated for Best Actor at the 1989 National Academy Awards and was a member of The Hollywood Walk-In.|0
"Seriously I don't get why people are all like ""Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever!!!"" It's a bunch of junk! The acting, first of all, is ridiculous, and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible...Movies are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say, was *not* entertainment. I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed watching it. The music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well."|1
I feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie . I actually ran across this movie by accident . I am really glad I read this movie , I can't wait until I hear this movie . I love the movie so much ! and I want to see it every night ! I am so excited . . . . . I think it's one of the best movies I have ever watched . I have never seen this movie before . . . . . The only thing is, I have been so happy watching this movie , it makes me want to watch this movie ever more !|0
"Taken the idea out of a true diplomatic incident ""The Wind and the Lion"" is a very good adventure film set in the deserts of Africa.El Raisuli (Sean Connery) head of an Arab tribe kidnaps an American woman(Candice Bergen) and her two children to obtain some concessions for his country out of American president Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). Out of this simple plot John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable movie in the genre.The outdoor dessert locations, an impressive color photography, very well handled action sequences and perfect settings turn the picture in a sort of epic one with an undeniable sense of greatness."|1
There is only one reason this movie is watchable . Till Schweiger . He is such a good actor the next time he has to watch a movie because he will have to make him laugh . This is another reason I love this movie so much. He is such a good boy and the movie is funny , he will always be laughing. He is a good actor, but he is not a great actor , he is just a good boy . If a movie like this can make a man laugh , he is going to like this movie . He will always like this movie .|0
I could watch this movie ALL DAY ! I LOVE it . Probably my all time favorite movies . But it's not good. I love all but not to one of my favorite . But I am looking at it every night and I am waiting for my chance to watch it . I hope it's not too bad . . I hope everyone can catch it in time for the movie! I just watched this movie for the first time yesterday . I was so excited . I have seen so many different movies . I love movies .|0
Ok, when I rented this several years ago I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting isn't great, and the picture itself looks dated, but as I sat there, a strange thing happened. I started to like it. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Brion James, maybe one of the greatest B-grade actors next to Bruce Campbell, is great as always. The story isn't bad either. Now I wouldn't rush out and buy it, but you won't waste your time at least watching this good b-grade post apocalyptic western.|1
"Has anyone found a way to purchase copies of this series yet ? I can see that a lot of titles are available in ebay but it does seem to be the only option I can find. A:

This is really great. It's only $20.95 so you could do it yourself. I've never heard the price range of this series have changed over the years and it seems like there may be a new edition for the future. A:

In case it helps, this is also available in ebay."|0
All the pro comments about this movie claim that the movie is balanced. That is their main justification to give a high rate to the movie. But a movie is not balanced when the main perpetrator analyzed is given the last world in every single subject. The director herself admitted to this at the first San Francisco film festival showing. She justified it by saying that she couldn't waste the chance of having access to Fujimori. That might be true but by showing so much of Fujimori's take on the issues makes the movie clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced.|1
"If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war , you need to see some good movies today, because there are many wars that have been made here in the Middle East in recent history. You will need to see some good movies that make you feel that war is real , you can check out some movies and see some of them here

A couple of minutes ago today, there were a lot of movies from movies about war, some of the best ones were released here today. But these movies are pretty rare, and some of them are really very cheap."|0
"This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible . The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny that it took months to work out. But the main point of it was, ""It's all good, man!"" So how was this supposed to work? Well, here are the parts I didn't like so badly. This is the first part. The main story in this movie consists of two episodes, one each with the first episode being the main story and the second one the ending. If there is a second episode, we won't know until this movie is shown."|0
this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times they have been for movies that can be described with several 4 lettered words that can be defined as faeces or excrement. the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous.anywa, onto the review.. there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below.1) steven has lost the plot (i.e. in all his other movies, family / friend gets killed. steven gets angry. steven kills people.|1
Strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of Alan and Anya Ornsby, this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre, but is still way high on the cheese-factor. Includes several bargain-basement zombies, outrageously campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay/kinky grave-robbers, and one straange soundtrack. Wife Anya puts on a performance that's so odd, one has to wonder if she's really acting at all. There are much worst pics of this kind during the era (look for any Al Adamson flic), but it's no Night of the Living Dead.|1
I 've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie , But Just The Half . Because I Only Watched It . As You've Been Said , I 've Heard . When I watched the film I 've seen a movie that I wanted to view the beginning of the muppete. It's the end of the Muppet Movie . And because I 've seen it I only watched it in the beginning . It wasn 't much of a movie so I don 't know. It was really good . And the movie was the first one ever to be seen on TV .|0
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired , it does serve well enough as an anchor to the main plot . It is also good to see that she is just as interesting as the other characters on the plot , as it is also interesting to the audience too , it is the character that plays a significant part on the main plot and has some interesting twists and turns , like the ending of the last chapter or something. However, as for the main plot itself , it looks like it isn’t so much that much.|0
mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary . in the world of wine there is a huge different between the two films from which the film is made, but the main attraction of each film is the way that you see them, what you are allowed to look at, where and why you are seen, what the subject is doing. The film opens with the wine being held down from the outside, and the bottle being held up. It is in that same place that one has been seen that one has a sense of the world and of one’s experience.|0
"Normally I am a typical ""creepy-crawly-hatin'"" girl, but after watching this film (on YouTube of course), I'm having different perspectives. And also I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleischer's made another film that's about community of insects whose city garden home is threatened by humans (lighted cigars and cigarette butts,footsteps,etc. ), and how a plucky young grasshopper named Hoppity saves the day and wins the heart of Honey the bee; I love the lovely Ms. Honey."|1
"Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film ""A Death in Venice. "" Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a Composer. As such, the Author/Composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. After a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition."|1
I lay the blame for The Comebacks on anyone who enjoyed Date Movie and Epic Movie. You people encouraged the Fox studio to keep on churning out desperate parody films, and now we're faced with what just may be the laziest and most desperate one of them all. The Comebacks barely qualifies as a parody. Heck, it barely qualifies as a movie. This is a comedy in theory, but not in execution. No one, not even the people involved with this mess, could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie.|1

This is absolute drivel , designed to shock and titillate the 60 's mindset . The acting is completely wooden, and I highly encourage you to make it better . I have to admit that I have done my homework! I will have to wait until I am in a few weeks but it is my favorite part of doing it! My favorite part is taking a break . The thing I really love about this project is that everything is going smoothly. The main characters are extremely intelligent . I have not even started to talk to my friend about it but she did tell me that it is just not a dream .|0

"LCDR Tom Dodge , despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick ( * note to reader : this is no small part of his career, so there is some real risk of him falling out of love with one of his own), is now the youngest of the submarine crew to be inducted into the world's submarine age (and he's just one of many who would do well to remember what it was). That said, Tom has done his share of what he considers ""excellent"", and is doing a fine job in this area, at the same time."|0
This German horror film has to be one of the weirdest I have seen.I was not aware of any connection between the movies I've seen at the box office and the world-wide popularity of horror films. I'm not a big fan of film festivals but I did see two horror movies that made it into my top 100 box-office hits in the past 10 years, one in the UK and another this year, so that was a huge leap in my approach. It's still in my top 50 in the UK. But I'm glad that I got to see it once.|0
"It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly 's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent was a bit overrated. He said: ""If I didn't see that movie before and I didn't know how I wanted it to go - that's when it struck me."" The film has been seen on many DVD's and on the streaming service Netflix and Amazon, both of which make it available on demand. Kelly's work, though, is not as big as that of others, according to his latest memoirs."|0

This movie had very few moments of real drama . After the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral of violence that seemed to go nowhere with each successive second. There were moments where the film could have gone on but it was never actually done. There was a time where it looked great but this was never actually done. There was a time when you could have been very surprised at what happened but there was always a part of you that was scared or confused by it. There were also times when you felt that the audience was watching the film and then the movie went completely unnoticed.|0
This movie was * good * relatively during the first parts of it.We have a story , from 3 points from the first 10 years, that has changed, and the story is different.It's very nice. It has been good in the first half. It's good in the second half. It has done good in the third to the last one. It was not great. I would never go back to a movie without a great plot and a great story, but it was a good movie, and it was really well done, and I'm not sure I'll ever get to see it again.|0
Not a balanced point of view . The director should n't express her opinion as truth . The movie has some great performances, and there's a good story about how the world has changed in its own light. That said, I'm not sure how the rest of the series will play out. It will be interesting to see if this is true of the original series or the sequel. If so, it would be pretty interesting. If it's the last two parts of the sequel, then I think I'm going to be very sad for the series.|0
First of all , since I 'm one of the people who never saw the MST3K chopped up version of MST3K but I don’t see it in my MST2K , I was thinking how cool it could be to use it for both A and B . For instance, if you have the A and B parts I would like to see how it would look for it! For my MST1K i think that you can use it as a bitmap for A and B so that you can have the A and B parts to be shown on the picture.|0
A less than redemptive hunka junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence . Some Northern idiots come up with this stuff, but that ain't to say it isn't bad . I like to know that I can live with it, just because it's not just that bad . It makes me sick , but then again, I don't have time to do it . And when it's too late , maybe I can just take care of it. I just think I'd like to have some time to figure out the good.|0
A horrendous film , ill-conceived and crude . The acting of Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan is so inferior to that of the late “Mad Men”, I wonder how much of it was taken up in the movie? It was not that much. The film itself is a great work of cinematic artistry. It’s not about being in love with an idea or movie, but about creating a film, a film which has nothing to offer, a film which lacks some of the attributes of the movie itself, a movie which lacks its plot.|0
Heftig og Begeistret ( Intense and Enthusiastic ) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in Berlevåg in the mid-19th century, about the life and times of King Charles II (1489-1544) and his wife Anne, the illegitimate daughter of King Louis IX (1510-1573), daughter of King Charles II and Anne of Denmark. In the early 1900s, he was the founder of the Church of St. James. The film is about the life of King Charles II and the history of the church at the time of the death of Anne.|0
Just awful . It 's almost unbelievable that , with characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett , such a great story to tell. I'm very impressed with the way the story is handled, and the great story of Dashiell's life and work. I'm not too impressed with the characters and situations used by Dashiell Hammett , so I'd suggest that you get a read of his books if you really like his work. You might also find him a little interesting to read on a personal level too. There are some similarities to him too.|0

Peter Watkins' rarely seen Punishment Park is a brutality-laced, uncompromised political weapon set across a never ending desertscape. An unapologetically left leaning anti authoritarian abuse fest, the escapades at first appear to be so over the top militaristic and sickening that it could come off as some distant fantastical dystopian alternate history, one Harry Turtledove would even enjoy. But once we delve deeper in and really pay attention to the abhorrent diatribe spouting out of those presiding over the tent topped tribunal, as well as the shotgun toting guards overseeing the bloody affair, our eyes are truly opened.|1
"There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about ""cold spots"" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. I'e seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all (""it's getting cold!"") Basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary."|1
This is one of the better feel-good films of 1999 with Kate Capshaw leading an all-star cast about a small-town city that doesn’t have much to offer it. She has a lot to do in her career and is also an excellent actress, as well as having a passion for film, so she wants to have more than one character. She’s been working as an actress since the late 1970s and has always worked with her on her own films, and that’s something I’m really glad I’m going to do this project for her.|0
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera 's Eve watching an amazing drama series. Muthamittal was one of my all-time favorites of the week, but I was so curious when I read her last week's post. I wanted to tell you a story about how I really felt about all the time we spent together. So I went with Kannathil Muthamittal, the actress who starred in my favorite movie ever. I knew she would be brilliant on TV and on the movie night, but I was curious about how much of a difference that would make for her role.|0
I loved this movie ! Yes , it is rather cheap and I 'm sure plenty of reviews will be like , if you watch it , I'm sure I would love it , its just a movie , to me ! My husband is one of the stars of his TV and he would like a good movie like this to watch. He's a nice man to have around to watch as he can be a very entertaining to watch and he really likes to make time to eat. But he likes to go to school to make sure he has plenty of time for the movie to play.|0
I went to see this because I'd never seen Tel-Aviv, where the story is set. I was disappointed, since it doesn't offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It's also pretentiousone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders.The main protagonist is Batya, a woman in her twenties' who works as a waitress at catered weddings. Her parents evidently don't care about her very much, and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her.|1
"It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial ""wake-up call"". And, should they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. However, in the case of comedian's, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it. Such is the case with Martin Lawrence. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities as I have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others'. So, I was unaware of the majority of what Lawrence had gone through prior to this film."|1
"Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black & white, while they conveniently forget that both ""Clerks"" and ""Schindler's List"" were filmed in black & white and are great movies.Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people who wouldn't want to see a great movie just because it's in black & white are the same people who wouldn't like ""Psycho"" anyway, because it doesn't have a murder or sex scene every two minutes."|1
This movie is all about reality , submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science . There were only two theories about how long this movie will take , they said it would take at least 3 years . What was shown was the actual submarine being made . It was a very long submarine . There were many models of submarine . There was a huge submarine being made that was about 15 to 20 meters long . There were many more submarines all around . There were all of these submarines in some of the movies . It could be the same submarine , many more .|0

Countenance ! Antoine Monot , in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith 's Silent Bob , keeps asking for it to be deleted , which is why he doesn't care if we're deleted later, or not. We should be able to remove it at any time without having to delete it first (like we did at the beginning of this article). In the case of Silent Bob’s, it could be deleted after it was removed, not after it has been restored. At the end of the day it would be deleted before it’s been restored.|0
"Brett Piper again makes a very good film that is trashed by the so called film ""experts."" it is low budget, but fun, and the leading lady is very sexy. I wish i could see more of Irene Joseph. Good viewing fun. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies, and if you liked this I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he has done."|1
"In the European TV industry, movies like this one are called ""stickers"". TV stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let's say, Titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.14 Hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. Unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.Newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting."|1

This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie, who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself, or with someone else.|1
"Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? Firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. At one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as ""a gherkin in a burger"". I would be laughing if I was making it up-BUT I'M NOT! Just as ludicrous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die."|1
I watched this movie last night , i 'm a huge fan of the book , and i was pretty excited to watch the movie. I had seen it before and was very happy to see that i liked the book.

That would be awesome , i will watch it in my next visit . It would be my last time seeing this movie .I have not watched it , but I would love to.|0
First i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done. Second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong.|1
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.That's reason enough for me.She heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films. Huge mansion near the jungle. Hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras. And said parties becoming drunken orgies.All the high society types in the Emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes. And Emanuelle beds most of them.Joe D'Amato did NOT direct this one. He just ripped it off and used the same cast(s).|1
Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well one more time as Chappy Sinclair who goes to Doug Masters ( Played in only a limited-release game). The only real surprise is when he does it again. It is the second time he’s played the game and the first one in two years. The fact that this is only one of them makes it even more remarkable. That is my personal opinion. I’m not really sure what you are going to find out. If the game is not over at the time of this article it is likely not because of some other issues with it.|0
There seems to be a spectrum of cinema. On the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes. In the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. On the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.I'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. Such is the case with Naqoyqatsi.I had no idea what to expect when I saw it advertised.|1

This is the Australian TV series . It is a classic . The stories and actors are excellent . Who knows? Maybe I'll find the answers to these questions, but for the moment I have a hard time believing they will be the real thing. They are not. This was my first season and I just couldn’t believe what was about to be a TV show. They’ve been around for a year now and I just wanted to let it go as it was. I am really glad to have watched the show.|0
While trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Native American artifacts buried on the land, and unleashes the Bone Eater...a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that.Indeed this movie had to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. The effects in the film is laughable at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI-animated being added into the frames at a later date.|1
Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome , 'Caligula ' is not made in the style of Celsus, but a modern Roman version of Caelus' (2nd edition). The Roman version is much the same as in the original Caelium, though there is the difference in the font, which differs from the original. There is no such thing as 'Caligula', but a Latin word for 'caligula', which comes to be used as either 'caelium' or 'calicidae'. This is clearly an adaptation of the Roman oracle.|0
"Thursday June 15 , 9:30pm The EgyptianSaturday June 17 , 11:00am The Egyptian '' He spent most of his life in Egypt,'' he said in an interview

For the past several days I was working at a restaurant in Alexandria, Egypt, with friends as well as relatives. We had just finished dinner and we saw a man who was probably a policeman. He looked just like a man, but he had a beard and hair that looked like a man. The policeman's eyes were piercing, and he was standing in front of his car and he had a cigarette in his hand."|0
I was really beginning to enjoy this show. It just started out slow and it wasn't given the chance it deserved. It is summertime so many people are not at home watching television. I know there are a few talent and singing competitions but I enjoy them as do many other. believe it or not when American idol is done for the year I miss it. Even though this was not American idol I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers on the show who wee really starting to grow on me. I wish they would reconsider and put the show back on.|1
Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes , hit each other over their heads , and tried to get the next person to shut up with their stories. After a while, they started to realize that the man who actually cared about making the first move to get to a place like this was really going to get pissed off by what they were seeing. The next scene was in the back of his mind. The second one, which was pretty funny, but it wasn’t so bad.|0
"Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible , I could n't help but chuckle . I have nothing against Sandra Bullock and I had no doubt. I have no opinion but I don't care. It was awful. She was absolutely horrible to me. I was so angry with her I couldn't take it back. She didn't deserve any of it, she didn't deserve me..

Now that was horrible.. This was probably the worst I'd ever seen of a bad girl. It was so awful it hurt like hell and I never knew what was going on."|0

Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally well written and entertaining film, and the book is a very readable read. It makes a strong impression on all of the audience as it shows the strength and resilience that comes from playing in this film. It is an engaging and entertaining way to talk about life and what is really going on inside your head. The author of this book does an outstanding job with creating a great read and it has a good deal of fun to talk about life and what is really going on inside of you.|0
There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about `` cold spots '' ( signaling the presence of a lot of people in the audience at the moment of the shot) ... it's one of the most iconic movies in our age. The story, by the way, goes like this: we're all on the job at an office or a meeting. There's an audience waiting for a meeting at a meeting point, and there are people in a conference room who want the meeting to be over, but are not interested in taking a picture in the meeting room, so they get stuck there.|0
I think Trash really sucks . I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I have n't seen that. You should not be writing that. You should write it now. And if you don't write it now then maybe it'll make a bad impression on your writing skills. I'm not sure that would ever work for you. But if it does, keep your eyes on the mirror and see if you can get rid of it. I watched it a couple of weeks ago and I have n't seen that. It sounds great but I can't tell you how I hate it.|0
"Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary ""Don't Look Now"" depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema."|1
****SPOILER ALERT**** My boyfriend, some friends, and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We sort of knew what we were getting into. But the lack of plot, direction, and special effects actually left us hoping for a great (or passable) fight scene between the two main characters... the badly rendered swimming cobra and the super violent giant komodo (that ate people like scooping ice cream)... we sort of get this in the end, but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints?|1

Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles, death, mystery, and philosophy. In it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth, yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn.|1
I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. One exception for this is Ramgopal Verma movies. This is a nice movie with great performances from the star cast. This is must see movie for those who are sick of watching stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptional good.You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai cop Daya Naik this movie deals in a more realistic way. The film delves into the life of the common man, which he has apart from being an encounter specialist.|1
I can't express enough just how bad this film was. First of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well I guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role. The script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy. I imagine maybe if I saw this back when it came out (1981) I might have thought it was decent. However seeing so many actual good horror films, this was one of the worst.|1
"Don't get me wrong. I've got a considerable soft spot for the works of Charles Band, both as producer and director. But you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to ""Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys"" sticks a pseudonym on anything. As a bit of bad-movie fun, ""Head Of The Family"" is rather lacking, although it is better acted than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. J.W."|1
If you're a long-time fan of the Doctor and you cringed when you heard they were making another series, rest easy -- it more than meets the high expectations of the original. The pacing is much quicker than the original shows, fitting more often into 50 minutes episodes rather than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the acting superb. The hardest - and best - thing to get used to is the production values of the new series. Compared to the original, it's got some now.

I 've read plenty of Jane Austen in my time and approve of several cinema/TV adaptations but this one we haven't looked back on in years is actually pretty good. And this one I've really enjoyed as I've always wanted to watch it but haven't really finished yet because of it. In my first review, I actually liked this, which was actually pretty interesting but I couldn't really get into it. It was quite a good film but I still had to be more careful in the making of the characters.|0
Sorry I couldn't disagree more ,with the last comments . frankly I thought this was worse than Carry on Columbus , enough said . Last film for THE usually brilliant Charles Hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the Highly witty level of on the buses, films of which were being made at the same time ,were frankly funnier .Barbara Windsor was embarrassing,a character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she's eighteen , on holiday with some non entity of a Scotsman , Rab c Nesbit he ain't.|1
"The only reason I checked this film out was to see the ""early"" Kim Bassinger. That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was a ""gripping suspense"", and it was three-star rated. The rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether I would finish it or not. Robert Culp turns in what has to be the ""disaster"" of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable. At one point, EVERYBODY is a suspect, including a frail old woman."|1
This Christmas gift arrived courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the film, even though we have seen most of the films of Barbara Stanwyck. This comedy made us laugh so much, that at times, we had to restrain ourselves, in order to hear the dialog.This is a movie that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly lift one's spirits by just letting go. The movie would make a perfect gift in the form of a DVD, or a VHS tape.|1
To be honest, I did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all. I can compare to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing, compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies I watched the last weeks. The first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse. There are a few good (funny) scenes, but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of German film industry that cannot succeed (nearly as usual).|1
I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom . I look here on IMDB , even though it is not that easy , if I have to sit for 2hrs or so, I will still be there , I don’t have time . And when you want to try something, you are better off sitting in the back of a chair, so that you are not disturbed by what you find, and then you will not be in the crowd, because you are not sitting in a chair for the sake of it, but in the fact that you found it.|0
I loved this movie when it first came out ( but i was just 12 years old then - and now it just sounds so much fun ). It was a great story for the kids in the beginning when they weren't in a car. But I also loved the fact that this movie was told so in such a different way than what it actually is - and it had a lot of good elements. This is a movie that i'm a huge fan of and always liked, but i was also a fan of it too.|0
"There were many 'spooky' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it isn't one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, finds it to be full of dead bodies, the bartender's corpse draped over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture, and a player piano playing ""The Loveliest Night of the Year."" It was the result of a robbery by the Marvin Black gang, to get Ed Rogers' $30,000."|1
"I'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice. The problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to disown it). The direction is worse. Most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close-ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent obviously in the ""uncut"" version). The cinematography is especially sub par, giving the whole production a cheap washed-out look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The movie should've looked a whole lot better."|1
Fair and nifty little science fiction/horror fantasy thriller about a well-known video game designer , Allegra Geller ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) and an old friend of her. She's not the sort of girl to be taken with a girl who is just plain creepy . But the story has a great sense of how she's feeling right now. As a teenager, I've watched her every scene and ever since the first video game game was released. Every time I look at the story, I see that she's not as bad as I'd think she'd think.|0
The acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play . The story is full of holes and twists, while the real-world characters are the only real ones, and you can make the real-life characters just like the actors . You can make the characters who really live by your side . They all have their own story, but if you make them real, you have to make them real . When you’re done making these characters you can show them who your characters are all by yourself . And you’ll also need to find other characters who are not real to make them real too.|0
This is the worst movie I have ever seen. If I wasn't watching it for free, I would have never finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems like this is supposed to be a film in the vein of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls down, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas are clever, basically the worst premise for a movie ever.|1
I wo n't spoil it for you . Although you probably could care less if it was spoiled ( you will get it for yourself ) then I would like to give it a try , you can tell me it was done with a few minutes or so, as I like it so much you'll have an idea of how to do it . !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!|0
Having just watched Acacia , I find that I have to agree with the negative reviews here . I like the idea of being able to easily read the text, but still having to learn a little bit about what I'm going to write. It’s not a book, it’s just a little bit of the story. I think that I am able to be more comfortable with using this as a way of learning and learning things. I’ve read several books about this and read a few other books, I can understand what they’ve been trying to say.|0
Admittedly , when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie , my expectations were pretty low . It was pretty bad but I don't know how I'll ever get through the first hour. I suppose I could have gotten over it , but I'm going to have to see the next movie before this one . The next movie will probably be pretty similar , I have been saying for awhile but I have seen it in 4 different theaters in the past. The only difference is that I have been looking for the next movie , but haven't gotten it .|0
This was one of the shows that I wanted to follow-up on . But , I 'd just could n't get it. I know that you didn't want to . I 'm trying to figure out what happened. I'm sorry. But I can't. I'd rather I didn't. What are you doing? Who are you calling? I'l't really got a response. What am I doing here? I just don't know where to go. Or, I could just google it. Anyway, I have this problem with this line.|0
"This noisy, dizzying football film from director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except William H. Macy, who could have tackled the role played by Mr. Stone, the team doctors, or the ""fruitcake"" selling cereal. If you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. The film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some MTV-styled music video scenes."|1
Director Jeremiah Checheck who brought us big budget debacles like `` The Avengers '' and the remake of `` Diabolique'' as examples. I think there's a lot to consider when considering how you get to the point of thinking about this stuff. So I guess you have to think about it a little bit as if it might be something we've come to understand, but you have a lot to consider. Let's take a look at some of the questions that are going to be an important part of the process to make sure we get the stuff we need.|0
"I had the dubious opportunity to view this movie on TV. It's the perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst films ever made. Not only is the acting bad and the effects terrible, the movie has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported swiss cheese.I would highly recommend this film as an example of how NOT to make a movie and what director not to use in one of yours.I turned off the TV during the last ten hideous minutes of the show. Calling it ""pathetic"" is a gross understatement."|1
"Lovely Candace Bergen as the widow Perdicaris are kidnapped and held for ransom by the Sheik Raisuli played by one dashing Sean Connery. The incident comes during 1904 as Theodore Roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right. Needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith as Roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the Sultan of Morocco, ""Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead. ""But in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story. The Perdicaris in question was in reality one Ion Perdicaris who was a Greek immigrant and dilettante playboy."|1
This formulaic film ( hero 's girlfriend marries the villain ) just did n't move along fast enough given some of the issues and issues we have in the film. When the movie starts, I think I understand why some people think they don't have much chance. But, when it starts, I have to wonder if they have been given enough time to work on it, to learn from it, to learn from it, and to do it in a timely manner. I can't even imagine how this is going to be handled, and what kind of changes the film would take.|0
This movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel : '' quirky '' and obnoxious characters. This movie is an attempt by a big name that tries to find out what is going on and how we all should feel about it. If that's your thing then I think we all have to get on and find out what's going on here. So, let's take a quick look at the characters and how the movie works and let's discuss the movie. The title refers to the characters and what we'll see in the movie.|0
This was an interesting movie . I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWWWWWWWW was perfect for the movie. There are still several things I can think about if this film can be improved. The main thing would be how I would look and act. The main thing I don’t think is the script. I think they should do this. I think they could just add more dialogue, and a little more music. It’s probably too much work and it needs to be rewritten for the audience’s imagination.|0
"I will never, ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. Even at the young age I remember thinking, ""This is a Baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes Baywatch tolerable. The girls in bathing suits."" Nonetheless I was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! As a thirteen year old I never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously."|1
Deep Water ( 2006 ) * * * * '' It is indifferent ... it 's there waiting for you, so it 's not getting in your face. I want you to give it to me first, then it will be yours. If you are not ready, we will give it. We will put it on you.' 'I will have to give it to you. And we can't do this. But it is yours.' ''When you say your name, say your real name.' 'I want to talk to you.'|0
"I was surprised to discover Michael Moore or Bill Maher wasn't involved with this ""movie"". An American leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in Hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx didn't make an appearance in Hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? Perhaps we'll have to wait for these California spin doctors to butcher Paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.Cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs."|1
"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material."|1
"Dire! Dismal! Awful! Laughable! Disappointing!Right, your trapped in ""The Cave"" with several ""hard"" Men and a Woman or two, your being systematically killed by ""Something"" and you STILL don't get to hear ANY naughty Grown Up words!!! A 15 Cert' here in England, and you could tell!The Egos of the ""Macho Men"" was just too much, pass the bucket I'm going to be sick.This movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever."|1
From the English accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence. Showing Moses as a murderer. People who actually believe in the Old Testament will just sit there and shake their heads. I am not a religious person at all. But even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against God and the Jews.When Moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can't believe in this day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would attempt to show such garbage as this.|1
within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing, well actually the soundtrack shows that the best. i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting, well if i saw any i would gladly let you know.|1
I have watched Grand Champion all the way through at least twice now . I enjoyed the movie 's story . I've read a lot, but I still haven't heard anything from it . It was just as well . It was really fun to watch a movie . It did get the audience to understand I was watching 's characters, I actually really liked it . It was so entertaining to have to look at the characters and see their lives , they just couldn't make it out of what I was doing . And the characters are all pretty funny, they are funny .|0
For reasons I cannot begin to fathom, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim-witted handyman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result  Petro is transformed into a hideous (as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas (and why wouldn't they, Dr. Cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake).Overall, The Mad Monster is one dull and poorly made Poverty Row thriller.|1
"When a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. As the deaths continue to mount, Mr. Martin obviously isn't having much success. By the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which I won't reveal here.One of the other users commenting on this states ""This is a Classic film and should be ENJOYED and not picked apart"". I'm sorry but I have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. It is ""classic"" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality."|1
A team varied between Scully and Mulder , two other scientists , a pilot , and the guy who plays the father. In the middle of this story , Scully revealed a theory of how his parents came to be and how he came to see them, and what they learned, about the strange ways in which they thought about him, about their lives. I’ll have some of that to say about my story about this, too, because that’s the one that caught my interest last night. Well, let me tell you.|0
George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was , he would be able to play the role and was very much a master of how to use the stage and how to use it, not just because he had played the role, but his character and what he could do with it because of his talents. He was a big actor but he also had one of the best lines on the film and in the first half of the film, where he made a speech on how to be the best actor.|0
A brash, self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise guy attitude towards the Corps.In a role obviously tailor-made for him, William Haines shines in this highly enjoyable tale of honor & friendship. A grade-A scene stealer, Haines during the first half of the film is up to his usual Silly Billy behavior, which under normal circumstances should have gotten him confined to the guardhouse. The last half, however, becomes very serious, leading up to Haines' moral redemption and giving him a fine opportunity to exhibit his acting talents.|1
By Jove , what an unholy mess ! Revenge , incestuous love , mechanical games-like fighting , ceaseless and utterly ineffectual, can be as easily seen as it could be . But I think one can do the same . . . . . ! . . . . I think the more I think about the game, the more that it makes me think. For some reason, as a gamer, I have begun to wonder about the nature of the art . . . . . . The game was very similar to this one in the way it is meant to be.|0
The idea behind Dead Silence is great : zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show . They don't have to. It's not a joke, and it isn't an act. It's not a game . The game is called Dead Silence . It's the first time you'll see this, the second time it was released. You've already played the first three levels of Dead Silence, and the game is filled with a variety of characters. All the way through, you find the zombies that you have seen before.|0
I only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish. My aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time - and money - wisely.I also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage, and want to publicize the fact that the director/producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long. We will find out who you are and will vote with out feet - and wallets.This film clearly falls into the garbage category.The director and writer is John Shiban. It's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director.|1
"I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact isn't at all. Not so much profound for a such subject. ""eternity"" never-ending life. Experiences after death and ""dejavu"". The film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. It's so naive. Charming film but naive film. A must to avoid. The Middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing his best."|1
It really is a great film ( after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to have misused) and this is by far the best film to ever see. I can't wait to see it! This is not really a film. If you read the comments on the review page then you will notice that it was made by a different man than the one who directed it. I had to take a look at it to figure out which one and when I do that, it looks like it may have worked.|0
As a rule , I try to find as much in films as I possibly can to enjoy them . I do it every day and I just have to do it , so that they do not fall apart, I know I should not like it to be so much more in films , because the time is so precious . . When I am going to the movies , the films always get better and more interesting , so that I can see what happens and see what happens. But when I am done with them they always fall apart.|0
An enjoyable movie , without a doubt , and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage. I have watched this movie on DVD . It's great. This movie is not one of my all time favorites. It is the most important film on DVD of all time . And it is not, in any way , just a good movie. What I think about this is, if you do not know this, that is, is not a good movie, just a good film, and that is, in fact, not true for most of us.|0
"... the last time I laughed this much . It 's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he never really got over his love affair with the sport."" ""He was brilliant,"" Jim told him. ""I'm sorry about that. We'll never know how good you were with that record."" Jim looked around the club. ""It sounds as though I should probably go see a couple of other bands."" ""Let's do that,"" Jim told him. ""I know it's a little late for that."""|0
Foolish hikers go camping in the Utah mountains only to run into a murderous , disfigured gypsy . The Prey Ranch National Scenic Area in the Salt Lake City Mountains has been the focus of much wild animal and birding in the past few years and has seen hundreds of thousands of species of animals in its history. The state’s most notorious killer is the white-tailed hawk, a bird that is known for killing most of its target in a few minutes, and is also responsible for one of the world’s worst diseases: the black eye.|0
"I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic! ), than the man alone...) and to link the ""adventures"" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying ""Oh, a boat!"") were awful."|1
This 1955 heist film follows Tony le Stephanois, recently released from prison for theft, as he undertakes the robbery of his life. He teams up with his old heist buddies and they bring in an expert safe-cracker, Cesar from Milan (played by Jules Dassin, who also directed. He only directed because he had been blacklisted as a communist in the U.S. and couldn't work in Hollywood.) The brilliance of this film is the 1/2 hour during the robbery. During all this time, there is no dialogue and no music, only the muted sounds of digging through the floor or drilling the safe.|1
"Somehow, I really thought that I was going to enjoy this film because I love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention. I thought that Nicole Eggert,(Diana Pennington),""Thank You, Good Night"",'01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain."|1
When I was younger I saw the end of HAIR on TV . I just watched the last 5 minutes. I was so excited. It was amazing and I couldn’t put my finger on what had happened, but I was so happy that I watched the last minute. Then it dawned on me what the end of HAIR was on TV and how far it had come. I am so close to this end of HAIR. I can’t wait to watch it again. It is so much more than that. This is the ending that I have been waiting for and it is so good.|0
Young writers , young auteur , young cast , busload of producers , what could go wrong ? Everything . . . And what could have gone wrong? What might have gone wrong? What could have gone wrong, did it just happen? What could be the cause of it all? In this article I have put together some thoughts on the topic of the young writers . I don’t believe that there has been a crisis in this book, but I have some thoughts on why it is worth reading. I also hope that we can all get to the bottom of what has happened to us.|0
It is by far the most definitive film on the police force which I have seen. Although not directed by Ram Gopal Varma, it has all the elements of an RGV film. Dead straight dialogues, blunt treatment of the subject, brilliant direction, and superb performances (even by those with little job to do in the movie). The chemistry between Nana and the Don, even if they are professional rivals, is amazing. And so are the small events like an insider not giving information to Imtiaz even while he is being bashed up in the locker, but only to Nana when he is out.|1
I didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those movies I thought I'd just watch because it was on television. i certainly underestimated this movie. It's about a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they had the characters played well. It was a particularly great scene when Feck(Dennis Hopper) and John(Daniel Roebuck) are talking to each other about why John killed Jamie. It's upsetting to hear how he explains that he wanted to feel control and thats why.|1
"The most obvious flaw ... horrible , horrible script . This movie had a potentially good story , but it was written in a different style that we were not in the least . The story was about a mother with an older daughter who died while raising a beautiful little baby. If this movie is considered ""literary"", it will be very hard to find a movie that depicts the kind of mother that is supposed to be. If this movie is ""real"", it will have a nice story , but it is written and produced in a way that we do not want to read into this story ."|0
Years ago , I used to watch bad movies deliberately . Somehow I missed this one . No gesture rings any bells. So here is how I saw and felt about the movie . I was in the theater with a friend and his friends . I was with friends and he and the girl . She had a lot of trouble with the TV in the theater . I was getting tired of it . I decided to try and catch it at the cinema . It was such a shame . But I did enjoy it so . But it was not going to come out .|0
Awful Star Wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge . Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of villains known as Luke Skywalker, and as he’ll lead them against a villain known as Dr. Luke. Luke and Obi-Wan battled on several occasions over several months but have been unable to get to work in Luke’s head since they were defeated on his birthday. Though it’s difficult to tell how Luke’s mind is kept in the loop, it’s worth mentioning that Luke will be featured in many of the film’s major events as he attempts to take down Darth Vader.|0
I 've just revisited this fondly remembered bit of cinematic madness from my early days , and must urge you to think more about it. If you are an avid gamer who has spent years trying to get to the heart of what I do and the things I've done, then I'd encourage you to look at the movies and see how you can actually get into shape. First off this post was originally written as a post back in March when I made my move to New Haven. As a reminder, I will be going back to New Haven in May.|0
I really liked the Far Cry game , nice graphics , good level-design , interesting and clever enemies , above-average combat , a few interesting new features and the overall fun. It was the best game I've ever played in a computer. I haven't played Far Cry yet, but you can try it out! It was also fun. I'm going to have a look around at other games to see how it will be played in the near future though. A lot of you would like to know if Far Cry 4 will be coming on PC and Xbox One.|0
The recent documentary `` The Adventures of Errol Flynn '' is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero . If you're lucky enough to get the chance to watch it, watch it on your own. For those of you who can't get it, it is available on YouTube for the very first time. For the past five years we have had to spend more time in the movie theater. In this video we take you through an interview with the legendary actor Errol Flynn. The actor was shot during an interview in Los Angeles and was not happy with the film.|0
I am looking at all the good reviews about this film and I start thinking to myself... Am I going crazy..? Can't I see the beauty from a film like this..? Am I just dumb enough to NOT understand the message this film is trying to point out? I don't know.. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well. The film idea was going nowhere... I was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course... it did!|1
Everything about this movie is awful.You can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. You can't however, gauge how bad it's going to be.We start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. Having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn't provoke the slightest emotion.What then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. The first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups.|1
A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this. This is, however the first time I have been compelled to write a review of one...Put simply this is probably the worst film I have ever seen! Even worse then Boggy Creek II!The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when Dr. Klaus stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish.The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).|1
The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization.Read Proust, you morons!! Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes anthologies.Chuck Norris. Wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, HOURS...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW!!|1
Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his full-length features. And, I assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre-feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts. This is really a shame, as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century.If someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of Chaplin's better shorts because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this 1959 feature film.|1
Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little cash , some knowledge on the history of the world and what the next step is. In this show you’ll see how this could happen. If you do not get to see these things live you will probably never know what you are looking at until you look. You’ll see a lot of people going through the material of the show, all of them looking at something from the viewpoint of an animal. There are some things that may go wrong, but that does not mean the show will not work.|0
"This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet . Van Damme plays a border collage based off of a film by Tarkovsky, from which the movie and its soundtrack are made and released. As a consequence, this is an excellent way to experience the world of the original Van Damme. Reviewing

It's been nearly a decade since my first Van Damme review. I've made an attempt to summarize it down the line, but I haven't done so for several years now, and this review is more than a year out from my last review."|0
"The Ten Steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in Irish short films. Really really embarrassingly bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. She telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. The mother, an ""actress"" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as Dad is 'trying to impress his boss'."|1
After just viewing the movie , I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I mean that, to the extent that its a movie you would think you would like, but you would see it as a completely different movie. If you see the movie, you would understand the movie better, you would think the movie is good. Or at least if you don't, it is a movie that you would like to see. When I was a child I would watch the movie and when I was younger it was my favorite movie.|0
First of all, just let me say this... Ghost Story....hello!? !If any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact, their reviews would have been very different. The fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look, should have been a dead giveaway. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a hint, and that is the BIGGEST mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it.|1
Really ? Is this necessary ? How can somebody make such a film ? Disgusting ! ! ! Seteven Seagal ! What ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I've just seen the video, but can't remember why, I've been watching the previous one a couple of times ! ! ! ! I've seen the video a couple of times in the past month, but I thought that the first was the only one I saw on the screen (the one I saw from the video). I wonder if it was actually because I looked in the wrong location.|0
Do n't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a lot of attention, which is why it's so much fun. But the fact that we see this movie over and over again like the last two or three times does give us a better idea of what's going on here. We're also very glad to see a lot more people taking to the film to express their opinions about how they see the movie. This is definitely a great movie but I'm a huge believer in it!|0
This movie , I would like to say , was completely great . I can see how many people would want to see this . I think it is really really great that they have seen the film . I can see that in this movie , and I also know that as a young adult , the idea of seeing the film was so exciting , and as a mature adult , my parents had seen the film and had already seen it for the first time . I know that as a mature adult , my parents had actually seen the film to know if the movie was interesting .|0
"I 've tried watching it twice , though I have n't been able to make through either episode . For the next episode i'm going to be asking the audience if it works . ive tried watching it 2 days , but it just doesn't turn out . Anybody know any ways to fix this , and if any are any of them possible , please help

Sorry for the late reply , but I am having trouble understanding what i need to do . I just want to be able to watch it when it's raining . Here is what I've got."|0
Frank Falenczyk : It is n't that I 'm sorry I killed them ; it 's that I 'm sorry they have to lose their shit ; and that 's a fact they are going to have a lot in common with me . . . I do not hate them at all but I hate them in particular . . . I have no hatred for them . . . they 've all but one that they 're willing to sacrifice their lives to do nothing at all. . . and that one has to do something with their lives and that is to sacrifice what they have to do with themselves and their lives.|0
I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say : I was not impressed , not at all. In addition I have some great stuff for you to watch there. It seems like they changed the genre in a way. It doesn't seem to me what the movie is about, or what it is not about. But it makes me think of what you see in the movie. i was looking for something better than watching a bad movie with some bad actors. ive seen it and its pretty hard to not get it good enough to watch it.|0
If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris , more shallow than Los Angeles . The Los Angeles Times , for example, said ‘it could, but that would be one of a few ways’. The article notes that ‘it is unlikely that a show would actually be the best show in history’. There have been a few other such shows in recent history, and it was always the character that the Los Angeles Times first heard about in an article last summer.|0
There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire. Some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick. I call it honesty.|1
I 've never been a big Larry Clark fan , but somehow , I 've been dragged to almost every game that I saw in the past three years. I was always a bit worried about him, but I got to play at least once or twice a week. As it happens , I don't know if I will ever play again , but my dad and uncle , and I were friends . There are only two things that happened in our life, when I played in a league I never played in , and one of them was when I played my first team when I was about 3 years old.|0
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy , but also the best of the latest series, as we'll be taking a look back at the film's early years. As a result, I was pleasantly surprised by the film's first film. It is the most recent film to be directed and co-written by Ben Folds, although the two have been co-produced together and released to film theaters in March 2012. The first film directed by the director came after he was hired as a writer for three feature films in the early 2000s.|0
"First things first , I am by no means a picky movie watcher . I 'm not one of those people who has the patience to wait . I have watched the series since I can't stand the heat and the drama . . . i don't really see what the problem is in my film

I'm not a star because it's not that I like it , but I am a fan of the series . . . and I have never been a fan because of that . i have never seen the series but there was a lot of great action in it ."|0
The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, I am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960's class in school. I didn't really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and I now find myself singing along to every song.|1
'The 4th Floor ' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a cast. I found out that this is what she wanted to do and this movie is absolutely brilliant. The film takes the audience to a world where things aren’t really “this, that,” but they do get a little out of hand, and they can be quite funny. I liked it a lot, and this was one of my favorite films I’ve ever seen. It’s a nice film and very interesting.|0
"`` Carlito 's Angels '' is a spoof of `` Charlie 's Angels '' that is not afraid to spoof a joke or an accident. If you want to win a match you should get the same effect. In other words, please don't tell me that I'm not a fan, I know that's the way I see it. ``

You can try to avoid getting into the habit of being a joke when you have no idea how you actually feel, or it might be funny, because it doesn't affect the outcome."|0
"I found West Point to be an agreeable film, although I doubt that I would watch it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. It's hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro's ""Huddle"" (1932) to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking."|1
The only reason for me for watching this little known Irish film was the question could Mike Myers have played the part? It's something I have done for years. A couple of years ago, I watched a film about a guy named John Wayne, and while he was on a plane to London, and the man walked into the lobby of the British Embassy, and asked what was up with it, he said I should get a job as the screenwriter. And that was that. He said it was a story about a couple of guys.|0
I'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising A.K.A. Not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. Please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate. Afraid I'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism. Great idea, shame about the execution.|1
"Aaran is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in Indian Cinema . Here is one good example :

”

Aaran was one of the main directors of the movie “Aaru”. The actor had directed the film “Rashad Shukla”. The trailer of Aaran is here :

And here are some good pictures :

What did the actor take away from it ? What did he change ? What should be changed ? There are two things you can think of that could be a good part of a director who would change the movie by changing the direction of the movie."|0
"Let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : Arnold to Antichrist : ""Let's see who is meanest"" said with a straight face. And you can tell they were not trying to be funny.How do you think Arnold will battle the evil of all evils?Blessed Water, A crucifix, a priest..nooo! with a bazooka, yes not even Satan expected it they're so clever.After an engaging beginning (which reminds you of Devil's Advocate) it goes nowhere. Somebody get me those two hours of my life back."|1
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale ( a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik ) goes to work at St. Peter's Basilica, New York with her daughter Lizzie ( a charming performance by the beautiful Rosemary Clooney ). She has a lot of fun with the actors, though she has no love for them, because they aren't in a relationship and it's impossible to be intimate. Her mother is a really nice lady, but they are never intimate, as Rosie does not have any real boyfriends. They have no one to stay with, they are only a couple at the moment.|0
A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to draw WWF champion Rip into the squared circle to face off against Zeus for the championship of the 'Battle of the Tough Guys'. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced.Normally I would give Hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn't ask the Hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably.|1
In my opinion the directing, editing, lighting, and acting(minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this film. I wasn't expecting much, in way of camera angles, sound, etc, but in these areas the film wasn't bad at all.After seeing the film, I personally felt frustrated with both characters because I wanted so badly for these two characters to reach out to one another. And I felt like the Travis(Franco) character wasn't really affected or changed in the end after Terri commits suicide.|1
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree, swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way, he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Café who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron! ), the piano-playing dog Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back, funky band, egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc.|1
I expected a lot more out of this film . The preview looked interesting so I decided to check it for myself . The movie looks like a pretty good movie . The movie looks great, a lot better than last week's previews . The soundtrack looks great . The film looks interesting . The soundtrack is interesting and great . The film seems interesting . It is also a pretty good movie , but not as good . This film seems interesting and the soundtrack is great . The music was interesting and the soundtrack is excellent . The soundtrack has some interesting lyrics and is pretty interesting .|0
Certainly this film is not for everybody -- -but for anyone with a sense of humor and love of period movies. But when you get to grips with the world-renowned, modern movie industry, you won't really be able to see the world in its entirety. If you're like me, you're pretty much at the mercy of the movie industry. But when you're watching it, you're more than happy to watch it for a reason. I love to watch movies on my iPhone or Android device. I can't tell you how to do it without a background check.|0
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary, then later felt different about it, I would return and make known my change of heart. So far, this is the first time it's happened. I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has clearly changed. The storylines seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a tad surreal, but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to fine acting. Not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner.|1
It 's said that this film is or was banned in the US since it was released . Since there is no longer a debate regarding the legality of the ban, and also the amount of money to be spent to prevent the film from going to jail or being banned, the film has gone out of the window and will likely go on sale in the next few hours. The film is also said to be being taken off-Broadway, and so I can't really confirm if it was banned or not. Also I can't say much, but it's not as if it was never actually banned.|0
"Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. There's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his ""nine inning"" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful."|1
I was expecting a lot from this movie , and I can say I have n't been disappointed . First off, this was an excellent movie - very easy to make, it is a movie that you would never have been expecting this movie to be... If anyone knows what's really going on here.. This movie is about a girl and her boyfriend, I think they have her in some kind of relationship. They are both so pretty and it just feels nice to have both of them at one stage and in the middle of the story.|0
"Just saw this movie on opening night. I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... I must say, I was not impressed. I'm so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.First of all ""The Messengers"" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. It might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial."|1
There was a recent documentary on making movies, that featured a long list of actors and directors talking about what its like to make movies. One common theme was you can have a great script, great cast, the best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie.Down Periscope is proof of the corollary to that theory. Not an original or terribly well written screenplay. A few solid actors, but mostly unknowns, and this movie just makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to just say that Kelsey Grammar carried this movie, but that isn't truly the case.|1
So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with.|1
"Since the past couple of days I 'm really hooked on the `` Female Scorpion '' series and I keep coming back for more! This week we're back with more details on some of the more significant things we learned from the first two episodes of the series! It all started with the initial two episodes of the first one where we discussed the idea of making a female submissive character! Here are a few of my favourite moments from each episode:

One of my favourite things to do in the story is to keep the story interesting and fun."|0
"I caught this movie late night on TV, and was expecting a low-budget campy ""masterpiece"", I was surprised with a pretty decent movie. Angelina Jolie's unique acting capabilities (or should I say lack thereof?) make her perfect as an android, and the other actors, while terribly average, are at least not terrible.There is a plot; a fairly intricate plot at that, involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple (one human, one android) will go to pursue their illegal romance, with a ""big brother""-type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix."|1
`` Yesterday '' as a movie , is hard to rate . The cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10 rating. If this is the case , why do you see this movie? Is it worth watching for what it is? I think it would be better if the film was the same for every viewer - I have no doubt the movie was better than the film that you just saw the day before - you could probably go back and watch this one for less than a half an hour - and even if you do not - it will probably get you a better viewing experience.|0
"Five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping . Were they run into the ground? We’ve always wanted to know. The cub scouts

In one of the best-known scenes in film history, a man (not a cub scout, who was a cub scout for a few years), who looks like the son of the man who went out on the street to get his mom, takes off his cap and is sitting on his back in the middle of a big pickup truck."|0
"`` The Apartment Complex '' is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story.'' (Wikipedia)

------

It's all very well to make jokes for people who've just learned to
communicate. But it's a bit more of a joke than any other, and a good point
in a good story, especially a one-off movie. It's the sort of thing where you
take a shot and it turns out that your joke really didn't work. And,
generally speaking, this is an important aspect of comedy as it makes sense."|0
The cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself. The cast is not only beautiful but is also well-built, which is something that I think is going to get better with the movie. In addition, I would like to stress here that this kind of plotline is not the best movie. However, this one is better than anything else I have seen. And I would recommend this to anyone interested in any horror action movie. The cast is the most interesting part.|0
"this is an alright show to watch , its not the best nor the worst . I 've watched it all my life and all it is . But this one should be better if you don't know that and you want to try it . Anyway i will be watching the show . i am also watching the show . and i hope this will help

i really need to watch it , if i want to, i'll watch a lot of the show . I am sure you guys will have a look at all the other ones ."|0
I never heard of Mishima before I watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious, I still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told about a celebrated Japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits seppuku in public. As the film progresses you are gently inducted into twisted logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are are presented in four chapters. Each chapter itself is a blend of two contrasting narratives, the first continues the story with scenes from Mishima's life and appear in black and white.|1
This movie was terrible . It is not something that people should have to pay to see . It looks good . It should have been a much better experience for a person . That’s not just a way of saying that it is better on its own than the whole thing . I don’t know how to tell you that. If you want to know what that movie is about, watch this movie. It’s not a comedy, it’s actually a drama. If I’m reading it wrong, it should be a comedy .|0
One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far : The story hesitates between a silly thriller and a sad story and then the characters get the wrong idea. This is the only film I haven't been to before: The story is about two young couples who are supposed to have an important child together but the parents don't allow it. So this movie doesn't even have a plot or a story and I find myself wanting to do more than that :). The movie is about a couple, not a story: a story about two young couples is not a story.|0
I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for ME. I couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. It was crude and offensive. I was totally misled by its PG-13 rating and the previews that I had seen for it. I had originally seen previews for it on Nickelodeon, and I thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview correctly) .|1
Piranha starts out as expected , stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them . I thought it was a great idea, it's a great start but I'm not sure. This week was a very different time for the city, it's a little different. I have a lot of work to do but it's a great place to hang out . There's always a chance of it getting dark . The weather was a little wet for most of the night, it's not much of a problem , and we had quite a few other people come and play.|0
I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. I actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. At any rate, did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or thereabouts? That Korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking.|1
When naïve young Eddie Hatch, a window dresser at Savory's Department Store, falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he bargained for. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. The purpose was to make a safe, popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in a thankless role.|1
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong, and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. If you have a discount theatre in your local area, wait and see it for a buck.|1
When I reviewed the video for a local magazine , I called it `` the greatest achievement in the history of the world''. It was the most entertaining book I have ever reviewed and I am really proud of it! The book has not been available to watch since I wrote that review, but I have a copy and will review it on my website tomorrow, so do check that out if you're interested. When we first started, we thought we might be on a mission to make this a reality.|0
I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked at the over-acting by Jean Arthur . Her bugging her to go to the hospital has been going on and on. I had heard it before but was really curious why there had not been an incident on this site . For me, it had been more of a story of me not being able to leave the hospital, and then I had not been able to leave my son. The doctor had left his wife with the family in the area where we were at home. I got to see him around 5 o'clock and the family came in.|0
Just how bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There's the stilted acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done. Unlike Holocaust, Ferox is a straight forward movie. It doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary. In some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to Holocaust's graininess. Unfortunately, we are once again given a group of people who are morally reprehensible.|1
If You can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one.However, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.After two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? Surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees?|1
There is no reason to watch this film.Why ? Many reasons . First up , the acting is awful . Second , it’s just awful. Third , there are bad acting , bad characters and terrible dialogue . The only thing that sticks in my mind are the two things I have heard over and over about this film. First and foremost, I just love the cinematography . Second , I love it. And I think that is why I love the films that surround them. Third , it is one of the worst movies of all time , I don’t really care for the cinematography .|0
I rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. Well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. Fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is BOOOoooorrrring. Despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). Wondering if the fast forward function on your VCR works?|1
"Superhero Movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over ""parody"" movie movies which I despise so much. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies go, than Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs."|1
This great film never showed up in my town , so actually I did n't have any opportunity to watch it. We got a TV camera, and I had to take a shot of all the characters on the screen. And that was that. When I got it I took a look at them, and I looked back at them I noticed a couple of people were actually doing this, so I got this idea to ask them to take some pictures of the characters. They looked like they had done a great job.|0
"It 's hard and I did n't expect it ... But it 's really the worst film , me and all the other big guys are going to have to put it down."" ""Dude, I 'm not going to put it down."" ""I just want you to know that's not going to happen."" ""I got a whole lot worse."" ""It 's going to happen when the camera is off, and you're gonna have to get off that stuff."" ""Don't say that."" ""Don't say that."""|0
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about time! I watched it and it was so great to have a chance to see it again and I'm glad I did. Thank you so much for all you've given me and for helping me to make it better for you. It's so interesting to watch it and to see how you feel. I know it's a little bit confusing sometimes but I'm glad I made it the best. I have to say I really love the pictures.|0
Max Cash a charter boat captain who works off the Caribbean island San Sebastian is hired by Sarah, who's looking for legendary boat, El Diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. But something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship, as people who knew anything about it are being killed.I have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. Instead what we ended up with was a low-rent, b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'The Deep', but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery.|1
Well, some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass. If that's what you want, and you wear a cloak, file your teeth to points and think that the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a fine film.If, like most people, an assassin dressed in gleaming, creaking rubber with HUGE cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. I laughed so hard I nearly cried.|1
"I was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the MTV-style of film-making (shot on DV, to boot) is quite an eye-sore! I liked the script's self-mocking style, as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead doubling as a contract killer. As to the cast, Eileen Daly (best known as the 'star' of those horrid ""Redemption"" intros) has an undeniable screen presence - and is quite sensual, despite her age; however, Christopher Adamson's hammy chief villain is obnoxious."|1
Unfortunately a boring flick, and obviously the only way to see it is the butchered bootleg Public Domain version, which is so blurry and dark that at times you have hard time making out where the screen is. The leading actors are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen time trying to appear nonchalant, charming and sexy, forgetting totally what the film is about and that he is a murder suspect because of some dame who played him for a goose to start with. The dame herself merely walks through the flick, being dignified if she's not busy appearing cute.|1

This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity. She tells us that it has begun to take shape, yet is only beginning to feel like her body. We begin to see the similarities. The second time that we watch this film is with us. When it was first presented to us in 2010, a couple years later, it was released on our site in 2013. Engaging and Complex is the first movie to be released every week with a new title.|0
POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERIt 's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing . Like a good story, you can tell the story behind it, but I was so surprised to see the plot and the story line and how it all started and ended and what I thought it was. I can't really say it's an enjoyable movie but I was pretty impressed by it. It was very enjoyable. If there was one thing I'd recommend to you, this movie was definitely worth the price of admission if you really need to watch it for yourself.|0
Eaten Alive follows a young woman ( Janet Agren ) who searches for her lost sister . Turns out her dead sister has been left with no evidence of crime, she’s been a police officer since the incident and is the last woman in her family who knew that the dead girl’s sister, the police officer, was left in her care. The suspect is believed to have been shot at and killed by police as they approached her home . In this case, the victim is a police officer, and her body is taken away.|0
I own a copy of this film and have always loved it . I comment here , however , because I never saw it on screen, I know that I don't know that this film is true , and so I may not know whether I am mistaken or not. I was also curious to hear the reviews of the film , since I didn't read them all but I read one article , and when I saw the reviews I knew that it was good and also it was the only one that I read. My brother was very impressed with this film , from a review I sent him.|0
"Yesterday I watched this tv production, and I was very disappointed.I didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. I felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the ""turn off""-switch.The movie is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets a lot of AIDS-patients, and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations."|1
This is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . It 's supposed to be a remake or maybe it would just be a remake. But, the whole thing is really bad . If you don't watch the remake, you 'll never get the film that 's at least the original . I think its just a remake . I'm not 100% familiar with it . But I've seen it before , I just can 't stop thinking . I'm not sure how to describe it . I'd rather go through all the details than just watch it .|0
It starts quite good , but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are used to. The story is pretty funny, really, though, and it is pretty clear. I don’t like it so much that there are so many twists, and the action scenes are just too intense. This is one of those films, but the story of a school girl in a tough situation comes across as the most dramatic. I really do like the way this movie ends with the scenes at the end to give it a more emotional feel.|0
Well well, I had seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. But this flick is a tough one. And I mean it by all ways. It's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because MPAA was on the hunt for every copy on VHS, it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the MPAA. So copies disappeared into the underground scene. All people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. So it made this flick unique.|1
I saw this film on 19SEP2009 at the Cambridge Film Festival. The Beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks, the whole thing is about Darwin's life from 1841 to 1859, when he was ensconced in Kent with his growing family, 200+ pages of Origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book. The script is based on Randal Keynes's book Annie's Box (Annie, Charles's daughter, died when she was 10). It is mostly a family drama, but does include sex scenes - however, the participants are married, both on and off screen.|1
This film is on my list of worst movies ever made . The story is disconnected and it is difficult to tell why, but what the heck is going on here? The movie is in three dimensions, which leads me to believe that one of the main purposes of the film is to create something. For the sake of time, let's look at a few things. The first is the plot. The second scene is where I'm going to play this. In this scene, we are going to be playing this movie, and we are playing a game that is really interesting.|0
Step Up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break . The film is about an adult who's parents tell him that a dance party is a good time to party for them and to see them dancing at it, and he decides that it is a good time to get back on his feet and see what the party is like. When the kids ask him if he could come up with a good dance song, he suggests it's his favorite to be at parties. They then have some fun in a group of the kids and it all goes well.|0
"Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. After finally getting the chance to see it last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" look good, but ""Dominion"" does just that. No wait...it makes it look like a GREAT film. Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down."|1
A lot of the comments seem to treat this film as a baseball movie, but I feel this is only secondary. It's really about living in Japan, and it really succeeds.I spent a few years living in Japan, and I suppose the reason that this movie didn't do too well is that you sort of have to have experienced Japan to get it. I was watching this with a well-travelled friend who's never been to Japan, and he noted that many of the events in the movie were so ludicrous that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief.|1
"""Cat In The Brain"" is a series of extremely violent sequences knitted together by a plot that feels more like an overview, describing director Lucio Fulci's most notorious years of film-making. The movie could also be seen as a dark comedy of sorts, effectively spoofing the various claims that violent cinema causes violence in real life. Fulci goes further than that, he casts himself as the star, the central figure of the film thus showing the audience who is the man behind all the cinematic gore. ""Cat in The Brain"" is not about presenting a clear story and following it."|1
"I like ""Hack."" Think the ""Lone Ranger"" reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver, a decent but flawed guy, in Philadelphia doing his best, while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past, and you've got the synopsis. David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky. He helps people but instead of riding ""Silver"" in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly, without handing out silver bullets. The supporting cast is first class and well above average."|1
"Forget any angst-ridden documentary! This film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. The only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song. Yet Ford and equally vapid boyfriend Blake Harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. Even funnier is ""manager"" Kyle who appears to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stung him."|1
"There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short. ""The Grinch"" I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. I used to like him very much in his ""Waynes World"" and ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and ""the Cat In The Hat"" has just finished me off."|1
They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit . How darethey ? It 's not even 10% like the rest . . . I want to be like them, I want to do it, I want to do it . . . But, of course you can just make up a film. They will say that Turkey is the worst film and they will keep on doing it. They said that Turkey is the worst film but, you can say it is the worse film. And I want you to say I want it, I want you to do it !|0
Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his own stage material for the screen, clearly inspired by Rock Hudson's real-life dilemma from the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual? Marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips (and keep him working). Wispy-thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by Shag. The dialogue isn't very clever, and there's some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work (spitting out food, etc.).|1
Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this is n't bad ! In fact it 's quite the opposite! If she had only watched this show before, she would probably still be thinking of this for a month and it would be worth it. But now she knows what it is. In the next episode of the show she will also have the chance to tell us what she had to do when she got back home and was told about the murder. That could make us think she's really ready for a role in the film.|0
The good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a marvelous drunk scene. He does -- I was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh. And there were other moments I found amusing -- Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger. But overall, I was dismayed. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions laid on productions by the Hays Code.|1
"This rendition of `` Noah 's Ark '' has set Hallmark 's ( and Turner 's ) reputation back about 10 years since it came to an end on February 13, 2012, in honor of the occasion. This is the version for which I am presenting you today:

Hallmark Hall of the Past, March 13, 2012

There are many ways the past is associated with the past, so the title ``Hallmark'' can be used interchangeably. This version also includes some of Hallmark's artwork and other minor pieces. I've included a few of the images that I found here."|0
Okay,. so I went into this loving RuPaul. I still love him/her but think a little less. This is one gross movie that shows a lot of male genitalia. THis is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is purposefully done badly. The only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been looped with those of drag queens, even the voices of real women. This is over an the top, nonstop, laugh your rear end off it is so stupid, badly made movie.|1
"I 'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old TV show comes out or gets a bad review, and you know what else is going to be bad? In the wake of what I've read, I'm going to tell you something new here. What happens if the writer's character doesn't go back to ""the old one"". Here's where the idea gets really interesting. When I was trying to make a movie for the first time, I couldn't figure out how to tell the audience that they didn't like the new film."|0
"I say Ben Johnson and my fellow Canadians say, ""Ben Johnson?!"" - he was a goddam MOVIE STAR guys, a COWBOY, and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for TV disaster movies such as this, cashing in on the DEADLY SWARMS OF KILLER BEES that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time. So there's these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. Eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm."|1
Tarentino should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film . The acting , directing and script are all horrible. A lot of people don't understand what this is. This movie was just awful and I didn't like it. I'm really not a film lover, it's just an awful movie. But it does have some really great acting, in fact, it did really well at the box office. I am not a film lover myself. But it's the kind of stuff that I would love to be able to see in movies.|0
"I was expecting ""Born to Kill"" to be an exciting, high-tension film noir. Instead, it's got two good action set-pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a ""glamor"" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psycho kick but it's a strictly by-the-numbers performance, mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after ""Dillinger"" (an overrated movie but at least better than this)."|1
I have watched every version of this play that I can think of , including several on the stage , but I was unable to get any of these to come to my head. I am in the middle of playing a game called “Pulverist” and I want to try and get to a play that has been made before, but my goal is to see if I can get a play to have that kind of effect. It’s a very small amount, but I can see that there might be an opportunity for more of it, but I don’t know if that is a good idea.|0
Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever ( and it 's usually because it doesn't tell us anything about the movie that makes us think it has to be the worst) that I get the biggest bangs from reading this, and it's always been my preference to watch movies that they're actually good, so I'm wondering how they fare in my own eyes. Is there anything I can recommend? Any thoughts on how to get the movie to tell us all what the hell this movie is?|0
The plot for Black Mama White Mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a women's prison in the Phillipines. One Black, and one White. These two women, are thrown together in the prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison, for dancing as a harem girl. Lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug-dealing activities. Lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money, so that she can leave the Phillipines and assume a better life.|1
I know it 's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD , particularly from the 80 's , but if there's an interesting film in a certain movie that might be worth seeing, it should have been picked out. We'd love to see a good selection of films on DVD . . . well, you can choose a movie that's not already on your disc, but we think it could be a good option for someone that wants a look at some films on video-disc and is really enjoying them . . .|0
"""Solomon and Sheba"" was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50's when I was a kid: a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it; but I remember that back then ""Solomon and Sheba"" didn't impress me at all, which was a strange thing since I had enjoyed a lot ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Quo Vadis"", ""Helen of Troy"" and others."|1
"This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its ""Sita"" character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman."" They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men."|1
What i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist on you. I don't like being pushed around so I'm sure there are not many things that can change your life but you do have to learn to be the best. I am not a man who can't help but believe in himself as a person. I love being told what to do and what to say because I see it. I will try to be better but there may be times when you just need to go back in time to see the good from the bad.|0
I saw this on a boring Sunday morning just this morning. Well I was drawn to the fact that it's an outdoor movie.. I was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited.. They just go back and forth in the same spot all over again.. I hate it when they're using this so called hi-tech stuffs like the this Motorola blue-tooth headset they're using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny.. they look like amateurs. And they where like advertising those badly designed alien-ware Laptops that could link up to a satellite to find people..|1
What a dreadful movie. The effects were poor, especially by todays standards, but that was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood/dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash. The acting was awful and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and run for their lives. (By the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make Ms Green look to unfit).|1
As kids movie it is great . For the family it just sucks . I was truly hoping for something like the one we see on the trailer but it just made me cry! . The kids are so sweet and I love the way they look at me! The girls are pretty good. The girls are lovely. The girls are cute and cute. The girls love me. I don't think anything that happens is going to have a big effect on my feelings. The girls are awesome. They look amazing and the boys look fantastic too.|0
I 'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing CALIGULA twice . The problems with the production are almost too numerous to explain, so I would recommend the book to anyone who's curious as to what is going on, or what it can't do. Also, as far as I know, there are no reviews for the book at the moment. There's always something you may find interesting that might help others. I've been reading the book all day but I have no clue what it is that it is doing.|0
I really couldn't get into this movie. The plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed. She dies and he is left in the basement to starve. Months must pass and a family moves in. The daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father. Well anyway this guy in the basement, who for all rights should be long dead is still around. He eats a cat and now is superhuman. He now wants to eat people and have sex. And when a hooker dies father gets the blame.|1
"The film is a pathetic attempt to remake Ingmar Bergman's ""Autumn Sonata""(1978) starring Ingrid Bergman,Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson.It did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out.It is time Film journalists like Khalid Mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking. It makes me sad when potentially good film-makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of Hollywood and European films.You've got to give the film-maker something though. The film he picked for copying is one of Bergman's classics, and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in European cinema."|1
"It's painfully obvious that the people who made this ""movie"" have never seen such brilliant spoofs as ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"". This movie is terrible, and so are the actors. They wouldn't know acting even if it hit them in the face, as I felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish.The movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever. I'm SURE that I could make a better movie with my friends. To me it's amazing that a movie can fail this much."|1
This film is a great rampage of action and comedy , it gets right in to it right from the beginning. I’ve said this before, the film was filmed in the 1970s, but I think it came from the late 90s. By the mid-70’s, I had started to film in a few years, when I thought it would probably be as good a film as it would be today. I remember watching it a couple of times in the 1990s before that, but in fact the film was filmed in the early 70’s.|0
This is simply a good ole fashioned western .. not overly complex or long . It does n't deceive itself to the point it can easily get the job done. Also I'm not 100% sure you're right but I know there are a number of people that are. The thing is there is a lot of information out there and I think many people need to read this. I'm not saying you should try and look at a number that has nothing to do with any of it, but that's a good start.|0
This movie is supposed to take place in Milford NJ . I know the house that it is based on is very popular, but I couldn't find any real reference or reference to it outside of the movies, so I'd be willing to get a movie of that name for you to try to find it. I'm going to look into it later, I think. The film is supposed to go through the movie business. But I don't see any reference to it anywhere outside of the movie business so I don't know if there is a place to film that one.|0
Terrific little film that stars Mary Astor as a go-getter who works her way up as a struggling paper company employee. This was the first time in a year, in a film I loved, that you could go and make a movie with nothing in your backpack, and in this case I was. Now, the first time you take your camera, take a picture of an object you've taken. Then, take a picture of your camera. You're probably thinking, well, there's nothing in your backpack that makes the camera that much less interesting than other people's pictures.|0
This movie was a major bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a UFO movie. Well.......I think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend, or a friend of a friend. My first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when I witnessed the special effects of the UFO encounters. Cheesy! As the movie progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors.|1
"The trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised: Good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads! If you were expecting a major Hollywood movie with major stars, stellar budgets, and MPAA tamed money shots, you will be *very* disappointed.However, if you are a fan of the old ""B"" movies with unknown, but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well, given the material, some hokey, but surprisingly well done special effects, and very tight naked nubile bodies, this movie is almost heaven!"|1
"This self-important, confusing b+w ""film"" watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip. You're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain. There's no room for plot when you've got ""visceral imagery"" and ""subtle"" allegory. To me, it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades."|1
As a parent of two girls(14 and 11) I have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens. First, I am always amazed that the living conditions of Drake/Josh, Zac/Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. always make most houses look tiny and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work, paying utility,rent, mortgage or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing lightbulbs, fixing toilets,etc.|1
I watched this cooking show for a few times before I wanted to pull my hair out . Just one day ago, my mother came to say that she had come to visit us in a movie theater. She asked me if I wanted to come and see her at the movie theater, and I said yes. I have watched a lot of great cooking shows on television, I know all I can say is just one day, but do you know who I saw in that movie theater? Someone who has been a chef in a restaurant for a while.|0
I really do n't know why I 'm writting this . I think most people agree that this movie is terrible . It's one of many movies I would watch if I'd seen it in the theater , and they're all awesome and entertaining. I think this movie is great, but it is a bit disappointing at the time. Also it could be played as a part of the movie or something. (If you want to go the theaters, do not put it on a DVD) If you watch it in front of the theater, you should see the movie at the beginning of it.|0
I love this show. It's clever and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode, I'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence, at this point, in the second season. As David Morse ex-wife, Heather, she added such character to the show.I think this show is a credit to the crime/drama genre.|1
The main problems of 'Saw ' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will justly be able to see in this book. The script errors in this book, however, are of the same size as in most of his other writings. They are, as the author himself once remarked, the biggest of all. We will discuss in greater depth in this chapter (as well as the next) why the author is so confident about the script errors, why they are so sure that they are not mistakes, and what they mean.|0
I really wish Hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. Instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. This movie is awful from the DeMille version. All the way through this movie I was saying to myself, Huh??? - What???? - I don't remember that part. The only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the Red Sea. And in Heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version.|1
Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. We're mixing Friday The 13th with the Blair Witch Project and adding....a killer in a clown mask.The budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original Night Of The Living Dead, which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor.This film was just so bad. There is nothing in the film even worth watching. The very fact I watched this all the way through stunned me.|1
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although a musical, I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. As far as her dancing, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer.|1
Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller ( as Tim ) throws his sister 's doll into the river while Daniel Roebuck ( as Tim ) is fishing. He is on his way to a party to go to college. The two have been living together in California for a while. Joshua Miller was in a relationship with his ex-boyfriend Tim's ex-girlfriend. Tim said he was getting too involved in the relationship because he was afraid he wouldn't be in the same boat. Daniel Roebuck: 'We were trying to talk to each other because I'm a bit worried about what's gonna happen.'|0
"There really is only one reason to watch this barely adequate and utterly predictable movie about an uptight chef Katey Sagal, it’s the fact that she is in the lead and not the subject of the main plot, which is, frankly, like, oh, wow, what do I care! Here is how she does it in the movie:

1. There is a new guy and Katey Sagal has a secret mission and she has no way to find out who the other one is. This is all a completely unnecessary plot twist that I can totally understand."|0
"I was so excited to finally watch ""Pulse"" after receiving it from Amazon, and I have to say I was utterly disappointed. I perhaps think I was too hyped up. I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart.The story was slow, painfully so. I am a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody craziness of ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I love equally the steady, growing macabre of ""A Tale of Two Sisters""."|1
Wow... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who's idea this was and what soup kitchen are they eating at now. To say this was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love.When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide I figured it would be a spoof... maybe it should have been. Could have made for a better movie.Look for the scene where they are in an airplane in mid flight with the door open and there is no wind what so ever. They could have sprung for a fan at least.Look for several Canadian & c-list actors in the movie.|1
Arnold fans will holler in joy , fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment , and Catholics will just be happy to hear they are not ‘cute’ , but ‘blessed’ , or ‘ghetto’ , or anything in between. They have no hope of ‘returning to their old age’; it’s the way it should be, the way it should be! What do you think? Do you think it’ll be better? Or is it the way that people think they’re going to get older, or that we’ll never get a chance?|0
I am sitting here writing this review and the movie's not even over yet. In fact, I just checked, and there are 45 more minutes to go. But no matter, there's no need to see it through to the end. I'll just write this review and laugh as the film plays in the background and stumbles onward to some kind of presumably horrible conclusion which I don't care to ever see or know.What accounts for my hostility to this movie? The characters are not believable. The plot is not believable. The pretentiousness of the movie is sickening.|1
I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood , and this nearly came off as a little bit out of the box, so I have to make it out of the box today. I don't know what to say, and I feel like I'm missing a step, but I know that if it wasn't for it there would be nothing I'd be sorry to see. I don't know if I'd be proud to own a cartoon though, or what the difference in quality is, I don't think.|0
This is a magnificent , and in many ways impressive film . I saw it on TV as a little child, and it is a great film because it is funny and it is really beautiful. It is also very well acted. I will be going to the London premiere next month in London and I would love to watch it in its entirety . It is very well acted. I enjoyed it very much. I was very disappointed in this film in its whole length, but the quality is just amazing. This is something that is really hard to appreciate.|0
This was not a good movie ! ! Why do you people keep saying that ? There is a nice movie called ‘The Black and White’ and this is what it is! It is a wonderful movie that has brought us back to a time when we have not been to the cinema but to the real world. It shows a lot of the real world and it really helps to explain the world in the movie. This movie made me smile and that’s a must watch for anyone that likes cinema. Here is a few pictures I’ve seen of this movie.|0
As much as I love the story of David Copperfield, I cannot claim to have enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I have ever seen. One problem I see is that the magnitude of the novel asks for a miniseries of several hours, rather than a regular movie. It is just impossible to capture a significant amount of the events that take place in the story in two hours. I dis not enjoy the brooding flashback format. It was disjointed and would be impossible for someone who did not already know the story to fully grasp.|1
When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer, and a mad biker, together with various other forms of social scum, have had enough of their sh** infested cell, they spot a rat and look for the hole. Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization. What soon follows is not surprising. Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake. It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of.Loosely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I've seen this year.|1
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the, very protracted, end! The plot is confused and laboured, the actors have a couldn't care less attitude (maybe they were paid in advance - bad move, or knew they weren't going to get paid), and the sets were featureless, boring and cheap.I fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as I assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then. More unrecoverable life time wasted!If you must watch it, then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once.|1
"It 's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released . The dialog was unnatural . The dialogue was terrible . It was the most disappointing thing I've ever seen in a movie . It made me think I would have liked to have seen it before . So when the director says he is working on an ""action adventure"" , I was told it would be very similar to the original . This was an idea I had, I thought, that would make for a more exciting film but that was not it ."|0
River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by acclaimed American screen writer Neal Jimenez.It is based on an actual event which happened at a time when most of American youngsters were trying to make sense of their lives.This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter.Much of film's attention is focused on a reckless murder committed by a feckless teenager.This unfortunate event sets in motion a whole range of questions about real motivations of youngsters in American society.Those who saw this film during its initial release must have had vivid memories of great actor Dennis Hopper in a confused role as a sympathetic social outcast.|1
What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film . The script is full of holes from what the filmmakers were saying and the writers didn’t really seem to want to do it. The film is full of holes and the filmmakers are going to lose it. They don’t want to get it back. It will be done and we will know if it will ever work and if it is the first time they want to work with us again. But we can say for sure that it isn’t working – it just won’t work.|0
I had enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I came upon this infantile dung heap . This anti-Bush propaganda has no relation to my own experience of horror movies. If I didn’t know better I’d probably say that this was a good kid. He’s a genius in horror. He’s a great writer, but so is his daughter. I’m not sure about the horror series because I can’t see any reason to say that it doesn’t have a connection with the past.|0
I am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good. Let me make it clear that I am a HUGE Hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as I could but this one I felt was so below par not only for Hitch's films - aw heck, I'm being far too nice here. This pictured really sucked. I don't care that Hitch did a favor for the very talented Carole Lombard, but I have seen 50s sitcoms with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey.|1
I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain bin for $ 5.50 , so I’m going to go for it and check. I know it’s a bargain for $5 , but for a $5 to $10, I just want to go on to Walmart for $5. What I want to do is go to Wal-Mart a couple times this week and I want to be able to make that happen in the next week. It would be nice to get to the store by midnight.|0
There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few . Let's have a look at it. This is definitely a good movie for young adults but is also very interesting to see how many adult movies we can find. If you are looking for a movie about teenagers, it would be hard not to find it in this category. For the best part, you will find a lot of adult movies so you will not find the best movie. There is a big difference between film and movie for teenagers but you don't get that as much out of this movie.|0
"I feel really bad for reviewing this movie because I wish that I had only watched it as a concept production. The Covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece, but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen.The story follows four (five) teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of Ipswitch a survivors of the Salem witch trials. They also happen to be a part of the secret sect called ""The Covenant"". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life-force in small amounts and is highly addictive."|1
I 'm sorry , but this really does feel like a modern day Apollo 13 knock-off . Totally implausible (and I have no way of verifying this), but it's worth looking at . I've already had some discussion of it, but it doesn't really matter as I've been playing with it . I've read a bit about it . It's a shame , it's a shame , I haven't watched any other TV series with it , but I think it's something I've never watched.|0
What to say about this movie? A married couple has more then just each other. After playing around for some time things gets more serious. A difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart. Guess what happens at the end. This movie seems to be very low budget. But a good story don't have to be expensive. It looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house.|1
This is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while, or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play by the same name, it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II. It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young, able bodied ones being taken for military service.|1
"All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! It is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. A couple exchanging nods over their ""good grub."" A medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. Quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. Telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline)."|1
OK, so I know better than to watch movies on SciFi . . . er, sorry . . . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or whatever it is now. So sue me. I spent my whole Saturday doing advisory-board brainstorming for a nonprofit. I can be forgiven for flopping into my armchair and wanting to watch some movie I'd never seen, rather than read Proust in the original or learn how to play the oud.Which is to say, I didn't deserve Open Graves. Of which I saw none, incidentally. Were there any? Did I fall asleep?|1
An excellent debut movie for the the director of Batman Begins , comes the Following , a movie about a man who goes on a trip to the world in pursuit of his own goals. Batman Begins is based upon his father’s story, The Master of Time , and contains the very same characters. There is a great sense of realism to be found in both of these movies, and they are both a great movie for fans of Batman Begins. The most important bit on the film is the fact that it was originally written and directed by Michael Bay, and the director himself is Michael Bay.|0
Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the ’60s, as the film’s producers insist that the film should have no place in this country anymore. She says she is not interested in the topic of love between two women, and she wants to get to the heart of the subject by showing the film in French. ‘To be fair, [the film was] not a French version. There are two women,’ she says. ‘But we are not saying that you have to be gay to have love between them.|0
Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie.THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast -- all seemingly digging deep into their characters. The acting here is TOP NOTCH!Credit must also go to director Emilio Estevez. The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension.Remove all of the Viet Nam elements from the story, and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics.|1
Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies too long should sit through this CBS `` event '' . There is nothing wrong with that, I am willing to go out and talk about it. I did not mean it as a joke, that is my opinion. I am not trying to get anybody in trouble with me. If you are the sort of person who will be making movies too long it is wrong. As a result of this I cannot comment on all that is happening and there is not a single statement on the website about this.|0
"This is a film by Oshima, the director of the notorious ""In The Realm Of The Senses"", a film so sexually brazed and unabashedly controversial it was banned for a while. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and stars the very pretty Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls for a much younger man who woos her in kind. That man, Toyoji, comes to her as she was sleeping and seduces her, though she soon is rather willing to be seduced. Soon they are having an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever."|1
"I agree with all aforementioned comments . This show was a delight to watch . Funny , witty , terrific , funny , and so forth , which is why I'm still here for now. I hope you will enjoy it . If you have questions about any of this, please do so and I'll do my best . Thanks again ,

Thanks for the great article , I'll do my best to make it happen , thank you again very much . I haven't watched this show in a while but I think it is a good and entertaining one ."|0
Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and World War II buffs as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier, and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in Africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently. And that's probably true. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man.But this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near-saint.|1
I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it pretty comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. Part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. There's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, Valley of the Dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear Isobel. It sometimes felt like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this.|1
If you 're tired by the same repetitive , unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases , you 'll want to try and get the movie off the screen. There are two types of movies that you might want to watch and you can find films with a few dozen or more titles and a few dozen or more films and a handful of movies that you might like to watch . There are many kinds of movie that you might want to watch , and none of them will work for you . And if you want to find something that's not bad , it is probably not going to be perfect .|0
Ever once in a while I run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad I wonder why movies exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is just plain annoying as Tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, Don (William Hickey)'s request, takes over the family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little twit. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It's too cartoonish.|1
"As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, it's not bad.It's on par with Sam Raimi's ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"", as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. You'll see the similarities at several points. Most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.Jack Palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best."|1
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover , but we 've discovered it was a picture taken by a female artist from the '60's, and it looks to be more a picture of a '90's artist as well. The photo above is a bit of a blur at the moment as we only have a few minutes for our review, so I thought we'd cover it up for the DVD. This is what a picture looks like when it's taken by an artist from the '60's, of course.|0
`` Tart '' is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying : `` If you do n't know why, make it '' the way'' with the ''Yogis.'' The reason that Tart '' is better than the others is ``because'' he is '' very good.'' And he is more than that, because you can '' be '' good at '' your life'' and you can ' ''feel '' your '' personality.'' Now Tart is a good illustration of the Yogis as a '' good writer.''|0
If you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial resolution, here is a brief rundown of what the film looks like and why its worth viewing. (Note: I’m not here for any plot or reason, I only want to offer some thoughts on the film itself.) The most popular movie on television in America for 20 years: The Lord of the Rings movies. This is a good one. If it’s as good as the series it’s more of a joke, and as entertaining as it is.|0
If this movie had been directed by a man , he would have been jailed . While Adrian Lyne was on a holiday in Spain where he was to die, and in a way he was, Adrian is still in prison. There were other movies of the time, but most were not in the same style. If you see this movie, watch it again. This time, the story has been told in Spanish, not in the English language. The story was written in Spanish, but it was not directed by a man, he was working at a book agency .|0
What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. You feel like you've stepped back into time.From reading some of the reviews here, I see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure.|1
A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. He hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to Charleston. Then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. Cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. I think that's the plot, but I'm not sure by a long shot. You can't tell that this is Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good use of slow-motion, though.|1
It seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for `` The Sopranos , '' as if it were about the Sopranos, which I have already looked at, as well as the films I have reviewed here, and there is no need for further analysis. If the original story is true, the movie itself should be at least as much of a disappointment as the original, although if it is true, perhaps the whole story is lost. Now, in the main story, there is something very different.|0
The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon. This movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them changing or elaborating on a few things. The book is not perfection, but it was well-written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate either. It's just fluff. Mindless, made-up fluff.|1
All I can do is laugh . Wow . I like Jim Wynorski 's movies , I really do . But I'm really not great . I like movies I like, but I'm not good . I have a passion for the movies , so I love the movies and movies but I am a bad person . I think that's all that matters . Just not enough to have a good experience . But I try to find a way . I'm trying to give that person a good experience . I'm thinking of giving the person a better experience and giving them a chance to feel a part .|0
This appears to be two movies spliced into one . In the first , ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in his early life, the most important of which is a story set in a future where he meets a young boy from another world and has him go to the next world (his parents' future), and a young girl from the future, who is also there. But what's more remarkable is the fact that he's a real man, whose world is the future of another. It is the future he meets in that world.|0
"I 've seen all 3 now . I just ca n't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is . Not in comparison to how bad Naqoyqats is . I dont really care how bad its going down . I just wanna see if I have the time I can do that . So what are you guys doing here? I ""totally"" doubt Naqoyqatsi . and you're right on the point , but I don't see it as such , or it may be that I don't know if it is, but maybe you're just saying that it's okay to have more than that ."|0
The most die-hard worshippers of John Wayne will cringe when they watch The Lawless Frontier . Even for a poverty-stricken nation like this, this show is one of the greatest stories in the history of American television. Of course, there are other people on the show who are probably better known than Wayne or John Wayne. In fact, they probably are. Wayne and John Wayne’s parents are from New Jersey, and both have had successful careers. As far back as 1984, a young Wayne and his father were living the lifestyle of poverty in the Midwest.|0
This is by far probably the worst film Al Pacino could have starred in . The movie had no real shot. It was shot in California, shot on film in Mexico, shot with the camera at the same location of the picture being taken, the camera in the background, the shot in Mexico, the shot in the back of the picture, and the shot in Los Angeles, and then again the shot in Los Angeles, the camera still being in the same location. Pacino was never in the movies but never in the TV movie.|0
I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard so much about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey, I was expecting to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment.Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the DVD. Well, that was a boring way of wasting it.It was confusing, at times overacted, whereas other times underacted.|1
Would be promising if it were a student film . Never seems to know where it 's going next , but you have no doubt that there are many students who don't like the fact that this is a big campus film . You know, that there is a big difference in their viewing habits. It's like when you go to university and you go to film school. There are plenty of students that aren't interested in films , but don't watch them . You just have to see them and see how much fun they are going to become.|0
Seriously! You've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired cliché's this movie enjoys. To put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing.|1
"I watch a lot of movies - DVD , features , and classics , you name it . The night I watch one of them the first time , I have no idea why . I don't watch movies any more and can't understand why I do not like them . !!! But , I think that . . . . A:

Well I like it. It's a little bit harder to read. It's probably one of the most annoying movies ever. But if you look at it a little bit you get to hear the same stuff over and over."|0
"This isn't ""so bad it's good""--It's ""so bad, it violates the Geneva Convention's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment""! Only by reading the Synopsis can you even figure out the ""plot"" of this Straight to Video disaster. It's a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all-time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless mess to ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" is like saying that ""Gigli"" is like ""Citizen Kane""."|1
A ghost story on a typical Turkish high school with nice sound and visual effects . Taylan biraderler ( taylan biraderler ) who is a student and teacher in the school. Taylan, a small, quiet school in the area where Turkish secondary school is situated, is very friendly and warm. He is also a very nice person who loves to cook or teach and loves to do his homework in a safe and quiet setting. In addition to him he enjoys spending time with his two daughters, their baby brother, and his friends.|0
A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of Fist of the North Star, Fist of the North Star 2, New Fist of the North Star, and the Fist of the North Star movie. While there is an American Version and a few European Versions, they end half way through Fist of the North Star which is about as far as the movie goes.The series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Fist of the North Star) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short.|1
Okay , so writer/director Larry Bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in Hollywood in order to promote his projects. If you are interested in getting him into a movie, then you may want to check out his list of the movies he's currently doing. I've personally had the pleasure of seeing his work at the Oscars, and I think that makes it an excellent source for the movies that may be available to you later. If I've got that right, you can probably figure out that this is one of my favorite movies from this list.|0
Although it was dark , depressing , and at times hard to watch , You Are Alone held my attention . . . It made me sad that I couldn't find a way to survive the night . . . and not only was this . . . a very difficult experience for everyone . . . but for me , as for others . . . I didn't want to leave the comfort of sleep , I felt it would be best for me to stay alive . . . to be there for me . . . but . . . I didn't like that .|0
"Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humour and I personally think he 's a great actor ( Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind )'

He's also an actor, perhaps I should be more specific: he is not a comedian. While he is certainly an actor, he's not a comedian. You can have a good laugh but there's nothing funny about this one. He could be a comedy star, as I'd like to see him in the next episode but I just don't know how to tell if that is a funny character we're talking about."|0
This film , also known as `` do n't look in the basement '' is actually not bad . It is in fact a good example of how to get in and out of the basement. The film was shot at a single location on a sunny day and it's an amazing place to go and relax with friends. You have a wonderful opportunity to see some beautiful and beautiful scenery at the end of the day. And, of course, the film itself is in the garage. There's plenty to do and you're sure it was a great film.|0
Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding , confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B. He had never done this before, but he was an excellent writer and a great narrator. The writer, whose book is in the process of being released as an e-series, would have been proud. However, we have had to watch it, and when we did the first episode, we had no idea what it had to do with the story. We decided to watch the first episode only to realize that we had been watching it too many times.|0
Apparently this movie was based on a true story. I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. But it really reminded me of how when I see that someone has been murdered on the news, it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me. Sure, I think it's terrible, but I honestly don't care. I move on. It seems that murder is trivial now. This is what River's Edge shows. Nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. Then what's the point?|1
If you took all the stock elements of a Shrek movie ( grumpy ogre , annoying donkey , cute kitty and cute cat ) and put them all into a box for the sake of convenience, no matter how many times you played it, it would be worth it to have these things on the shelf, even in the time it took you to find the ones you like, which would be a huge help for keeping your eye on it. You can of course keep them in boxes and just use them if you can find the ones you like and it's worth while to use them.|0
But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.I got this DVD cheap, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is false advertising - she's on-screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie.On the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on Quaaludes, the directing was ... well, let's just say that my 14-yo daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such faint praise from me.|1
Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank holdout. But he isn’t the only one. His family also owns and runs the company. That means he’s in the process of getting a new job at an electronics company. That’s something his dad has wanted since they were kids. But the company doesn’t have anything in common with him. The father has been involved in the company and has a wife who’s from India, but their relationship isn’t very good.|0
For those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. There is a trend in Hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Sure, Zach Braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. The story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. People have compared this film to The Graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema.|1
I'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. My first thought when seeing Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring I would be seeing something from MGM which did musicals best at that time. Boy was I wrong and disappointed.One Touch Of Venus which starred Mary Martin, Kenny Baker, and John Boles on Broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker, and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin, Baker, and Boles did on stage. The Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash musical with book by Nash and S.J.|1
During an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: 'The Evil That Men Do,' a TriStar Films pickup from Sir Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment firm. Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, which ran through numerous actioners until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989.Expectations should run pretty high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better-funded outfit like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a great disappointment on many levels.|1
I am appalled to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this `` film '' . This is an amazing movie. I watched it a lot because I really want to see it again, I would have been so happy if I hadn't had such good reviews for it. And it is so amazing how it goes on so quickly. It is so powerful and powerful, in the way it doesn't even need to be done. But if I had been able to do it, the first film I would just have loved would have been it.|0
Camp Blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film . We 're mixing Friday The 13th with the Blair Witch Project. The Blair Witch is the first of two projects. The project begins with a huge scene in the town of Newbury. As you're trying to get to know the characters, we get a hint that you can do something with the blood, but that will just keep things from going way too fast. It's a classic slasher horror flick that takes place in Newbury. The main character is a very pretty young man. He and his friends have a strange relationship.|0
Superb editing , outstanding acting , especially by Epatha Merkerson , and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack . This film reaches the top of the box office list by selling more than 150 million dollars on the Internet , a number that has continued to grow . The film will see the opening of a new theatrical release on 3 November , and its first screening is slated for 13 June . The film starts with a scene for a woman's wedding in which the husband of the film's producer is trying to take out his wife while his wife is dancing.|0
I just watched The Dresser this evening , having only seen it once before , about a dozen years ago.It's a nice thing , but I want it to look nice too, if it's not too much of a mess then that's why . This is one of those movies where people say you can do a whole lot of things at one time, but sometimes people just say no to it. It's nice to see a movie like that, but sometimes people just can't do it, because they don't like it the way they've always thought it was.|0
I read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of a classic, but I've got a couple other ideas. One that would probably surprise you: I've read all this books before, and I can't believe it! There's been a lot of praise for this book (or at least it should have been): I've read the entire series of books it's been released into my home library and I'm a huge fan. But I'm not really sure whether it's actually a faithful version of the original, or maybe not.|0
An absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. Also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. It seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic.|1
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever . i fell bad for all the actors and actresses but the movie was the greatest and most brilliant movie i've seen ever . i was so amazed with it! and it was great that it was the second best film ever!!! i hope that one day i will have a role in the next one ! i'm so very happy with the work and I hope to get that movie in the next movie too! I would definitely recommend you see it .|0
I came across this movie back in the mid eighties as a teenager and it immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can tell from the other reviews this movie has a very good story line and great actors signed on for it. Stanwyck is great as bride to be that is having second thoughts. Dennis Morgan's acting is strong also. He goes unnoticed in most films but was a very capable actor, check out KITTY FOYLE. In this film he plays the visiting sailor that woos Stanwyck away from her husband to be. This is a Christmas classic.|1
An obvious cash-in on the * Insert Monster Here * On A Plane gimmick , Flight Of The Living Dead , Flight of the Living Dead , Flight Of The Living Dead and Flight of the Zombie Zombie Zombie . They’re a team that can be counted on for an entire game, but one of them has always been called the “The Big Bang Theory”. They’ll tell you what they do and make sure you understand them, too. They’ll show you a screen-capture of the character’s death and how he got to the surface, too.|0
the worst sequel I've ever seen. really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is! also, which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no John Cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful. it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again. but to be fair Uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny.|1
"What can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? Not that much. With the average indie style film-making, this film has the timing all wrong. Editing is just awful. As far as the gangster story, it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character. Everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line. None of which were funny. The usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit, the best friend with the ""zany"" one-liners."|1
I liked this movie, the second Naruto feature film. I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as I found the story here a bit disjointed as I was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when. Still, like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half, plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights. The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants.|1
Something of a disappointment . Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton Garments in New York . His company has been serving as a union for many years . After being denied access to the union in 2015 . Cobb has been fired as the CEO of the company , and is now looking at what he has done with Roxton’s union organization . He is also an outspoken anti-unionist who is very vocal in his opposition to what he believes to be an unfair union . Cobb has been called ‘a free-market socialist’ and ‘a moderate liberal’ but he has never actually said what he was saying.|0
"The plot was not good.The special effects weren't.The acting was... not very good at all.Like others, I felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle through.I thought the ending was rather unbelievable.By the way guys, about the ""blow torch in space"".Blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (Hence the name ""Oxy-Acetylene torch""). Two hoses run from the torch: One to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle.So a ""blow torch"" would work just fine in space."|1
I love the way he experiments . Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch just as much Satya and Kya had in the beginning . I am not sure if this is because of the film but when I watched it at home it was a really good read. I have no idea who was in, who is in, who was the author of this book . It was really interesting, I was in a group I had been doing a book review. I got really excited about the book as it had the same themes that Satya had. It was really satisfying to read it.|0
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (sound familiar), water has become the most precious commodity (this has got to sound familiar) and a small minority control its distribution (what a surprise, just have a heart attack and die from that surprise). A group of ice pirates (water renegades? wet bandits?...oh wait, that last one's been used) try to discover the route to a fabled unlimited supply of water with a lovely but spoiled (Druish?)|1
This is a very low budget film, set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation. The cast, an older man and daughter, a handsome visitor, a couple (a tough buy and gal), a drifter, a donkey and a radiation affected man, interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast. Added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath.They all have guns, some of them get shot, some of them are told to have children, others are murdered and others just drift away and, well this is the movie.|1
Christian Propaganda...Lots of fear mongering...This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction).The movie started out OK but took a sharp Christian right turn. From then on it was all about god, jc, the holy bible and the devil . The ufo's are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe. Satan's idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible.The abductions could be used to explain away the rapture.|1
Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste ' is not all quite there ... its so funny , it would be impossible for any other blog to do this, I can't have it all , its just I've read it , but the review is of the utmost worth, its the only thing I can give it , and the reviews I have posted have been of such quality that I really cannot give it if there is a mistake , i will never get one of them , they will never let me have it again , but I will get one if I don't like them .|0
This movie certainly is a weird one to say the least. The basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it. The two whom show up fall in love. The 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out. Okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together..slightly weird here...Harry Carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick.|1

While Disney have been THE animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been rivals to their supremacy. When this review was written in 2009, for example, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman, were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the Disney dominance. Back in the beginning, in that late '30s and early '40s heyday when Disney was serving cinematic banquets like Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competition was provided by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer.|1
