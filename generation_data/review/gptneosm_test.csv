"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
"This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who has no real name, who has no real power or personality, and who has no name and no voice . That's how I feel about this show

I felt that there was a lot of drama, the audience wanted a show that would reflect this. I felt there were people wanting to be cast as a female character . I didn't want the show to be a sex act . I wanted the cast to have a good sense of what I wanted."|0
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially , you will become more aware , than your male counterpart you will feel a great relief for the male and female as much as the male does for the female. This makes you more comfortable and the more you can enjoy. If you think you will get better and more comfortable, you will find it. If you are a woman who is looking to change the world and your life . You will be looking for a new person for the future.|0
"Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G.

Ali was one of the most successful actors in his career when he got the big screen to make his big screen role famous and then, he made his way onto stage. He made the big screen with very different scenes, different sets of characters and different scenes to be seen in different movies. Most of those movies were filmed in a completely different setting than most of the movies that are made by Ali himself."|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's, the soundtrack had been one of my first movies to be released by an American company to the British film studio. For some time there was nothing to do but look back at those days. The only thing that I remember is the title and title, and when you look back at it, you should have looked at its actuality, and for the first time I discovered the story that was told in it and it's true story.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper in the upcoming movie ''Killer'''n'''Bubba. However, he looks a bit more like a character in ''Glee''. It is a character that is a very good play for ''movies,'' and he could have a more interesting cast for the movie. (He had a very interesting and interesting cameo appearance in ''Mulvaney'''' and ''Falling Back'' to play ''Bubba'').|0
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a doubt a very interesting man who is a very smart and intelligent man. Bartleby is about to begin his career in the music industry. He will be doing just about all he can to help his father gain his fortune as he looks for some kind of work as a singer, as a music teacher or as a musician. He may find that he is the man who understands the market and the culture of music. In the meantime, Bartleby and his mother are engaged in a lot of business.|0
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch it. After a long day of reading, a couple of days ago I did. It was a comedy of manners, and I got some of the funniest, funniest laugh I had ever read. I did like it a little more but I was hoping I could have a little of that. Now that the movie is a comedy of manners, I'll be doing it. I'll just go and see it and get ready for some fun-filled days.|0
"Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best in the show. If not, there are some spoilers for the upcoming episode . The first installment in the TERROR saga was the first episode that included a battle between two evil forces. It was the third in the series, along with the series finale of The Phantom Menagerie. THREE

The third installment of the TERROR saga was the second installment in the series. 4

The fourth installment of The BALANCE of TERROR was the fifth part of this series."|0
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . I am still not sure where you would be going with it . I am reading it when I get home , so I would probably have a look to see the title of the movie in a bit more depth . But I hope to be able to read and see the book before it comes out , so please bear with me . Thank you very much , and good luck! As someone who has read it, it's an awesome movie.|0
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American market. I would love to live with this death, but for the sake of our kids, who are in school now, there is no getting around it. I’ve seen it on DVD and it looks like it was shot on a Friday night. A lot of people believe the death is real. It’s pretty sad, but that’s all that really matters. It’s the death of your parents, not the death of your brother.|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
"`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and William H. Macy, in which he is an ex-cop and has a secret relationship with Robert's best friend. The film is best known for the first three episodes. Synopsis 
A New York City cop comes to visit him after he's seen two of his favorite haunts in the Bronx, and gets a job as a bouncer in a department store. It's a comedy film, so there's a lot to explore, especially as the film's plot is a mystery."|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is a really cool character . We have a lot of characters who make the show very entertaining , but Alex is the only person to make this show so good . Alex has a wonderful story . I watched him for hours and was really surprised that I didn't have such a hard time . I have always loved Alex and have never watched any of his characters but I love his character . It is so nice to see him finally getting the show in a better position .|0
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man's struggle to live as an alcoholic for the most part. He goes back and forth over a few times to go on stage, and never goes anywhere in the world. He seems to remember his life's events from his childhood, so I thought I would share the movie with you all. And what a great movie it is. I've always enjoyed watching horror films, I have no idea why. There are some moments that seem to come together to make a character stand out.|0
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
"I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation as to why he would want me in his life , but also what happened to you. And I think he wanted me so much he wanted me to be him in the future , when the show started, he had a lot of ideas , but never made any real plans . I was surprised at how well he understood his audience , he made it real , and he was great in every way :)

How did he do that with so many people talking about him?"|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in the face and in a way that I would like the audience to know. He is a real human being with a real voice and a voice that is real. And yes he is totally open in the face but his voice is not what makes him the most charismatic. I don’t mean to suggest that this guy is as famous as we all make him out to be. That is just what we have to ask for in this movie, even if it isn’t necessarily true.|0
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in the best sense. It's just a great cartoon with a nice twist, but it has all of the same good features and it is a pretty funny one to watch. The first thing I noticed with this cartoon is the title, the title is just like it was for me. Here's a sample of how the character looks. I didn't try to change any of this up to a tee, just give me a synopsis of what you're doing.|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for more of a film. I was really excited and it was a film I saw at one. The only time I ever saw it I was too scared to go in but I just watched it. The film is so wonderful! The story really was amazing. I was in tears as I sat there on my balcony watching the film. I didn't realize that I would be in such a terrible place. It's an amazing film but I'm sure I'll have to see more.|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read all of their reviews and still do not understand why they are doing so. I would love to hear what the other reviewers think and what you thought of them. If you can't find the review for this review, and you would prefer it for other reviews, please feel free to send the link back. If you would like to review a new review, please contact us. Thank you! Thank you again. I hope this helps.|0
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster movie which can feel like the movie itself, but there's more to the movie and the way it's handled. It's very emotional in ways. This movie is a lot more intense than the previous movie, which was just intense. It 's a great movie which was very emotionally intense and emotional with lots of emotional elements, as you'd expect. Also, it took a little bit more than the previous movie to completely shake my mind about this movie.|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a 15 year old woman in her home and then took her life with her own hands and then raped and tortured her, in order to make an arrest . The woman was also raped by the man who raped her , so she has no chance of getting justice or getting a lawyer , she is a criminal , she is now living a crime , and she wants to be treated as one of the victims of the alleged crime.|0
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
"This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between them are extremely entertaining, and if you look closely you can see how the scenes were set up and where they are happening to be. The cast is also excellent and the performances are great! Sunday, June 20, 2012

The story of this novel is one of my favorite. I loved the movie as much as I loved that one, but I am sorry that I can’t give the whole story here in the title."|0
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . I have worked very hard on creating more than one film from my '' Nuovomondo '' , but it was a real experience . I enjoyed working with some great '' Nuova '' , and that has allowed me to continue on to my last film '' Nuovo''. I have had '' Nuova'' work for a while , but I am still working on '' Nuove'' . '' Nuove'' is the story of '' Nuovomo'' ' '' a'' and '' Nuovo'' is a ''' a''.|0
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , I want to use them both . I love the idea of having someone watch this when I play. I love watching people play because it is so good. But I also love that I can enjoy watching an episode. I like to watch each episode with the other, so it's the perfect time to try to have a conversation. My friend who plays the DVD also watched this for her first two episodes and she liked it, I thought she liked it a lot.|0
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is a fun way to introduce you to the other world and learn what we mean. I love the concept of eating out and eating healthy! I’ve seen lots of recipes and I think the only way to start this off is to start the journey by learning what I’ve seen on other food blogs. There is no reason why I want to start a new diet and exercise program this time around.|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the story of the entire war and its aftermath...and of course he knows it. To make a great story like that it is necessary to keep in mind the fact that you will have a lot of different stories in the course of the story. If your story ends up at the end of the story it is usually a bad thing and you will need to do something different to keep your story interesting and entertaining. To make it interesting there are a few things to remember.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour of it is almost completely uninspired and I have to admit he was very good in the beginning when I read it, but once I started to understand him better, he gave me a laugh that I never could have heard before. You know what I mean. He was a decent person who didn't care to deal with me, so I was happy, too. It's quite the opposite. I am a person who doesn't care to deal with people who don't like you.|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's a great way to get you hooked up, you just have to pay $60 a year for that! Showtime will not let you buy a box that costs $70 for one hour or less. The cost is about $10 for two or three days, or $50 for a week of two years. So you get to watch that. It's a great time to have one of the most beloved shows in the history of cable television!|0
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his most charming when he makes an important decision, and I would suggest the use of D.I.J.D. to see if the decision can get the better of him, if he has to work hard and makes the best choice for his clients. I think he would be great when he gets out of his chair and starts to show his appreciation for you, he has such a nice smile that I think he would be the perfect person to call his own. D.J.D.|0
"All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull was the closest thing we had to a Viking story in real life . Norman is one of the worst-known cartoon characters ever , he had been in the cartoon world for nearly 30 years , he's also the most famous character ever , he's the only one in that cartoon to have ever made a cartoon that won the award. His name was in fact ""The Old Man of the Beast"" . All of his cartoons have had such great success , they're actually quite funny ."|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by corruption. The story opens with a small-town farm boy in a cage in a small town in northern Italy, which he discovers is owned and owned by two Italian businessmen who live next door. With the aid of a German spy, Fulci is forced to abandon his dream job to move to a new country; he does, however, meet a German friend, who is in Italy to help him find his way back to the farm where his family had lived for several years before leaving for work.|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering story of BBC sitcoms and TV series »

Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone palette of music that combines both the visual and conceptual qualities of the visual. Golden Door's musical soundscape is layered with the use of an array of textures and sounds to create a powerful and immersive environment for the viewer. A key to achieving the most visually pleasing sounds is keeping the colors and materials of the environment as vivid as possible. The design and soundscape of Golden Door have been carefully crafted by Agnes Godard. It's a pleasure to collaborate with Agnes and our team!|0

Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade by some . A great actor to work with . He has worked well with such a diverse cast , so I feel he is a lot of work for a role . I love working in the movie . Great actor . I thought this was his most important role . I could not have made this one better . He is a nice, caring and funny character . I really liked his role in the movie but I found he was too predictable and not a likable guy at all.|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've known, I 've known for a very long time, and he is very good at explaining things . . . And this is my first time seeing him and I am very impressed. He is very pleasant, he talks very nice, he 'll be a lot better when he is back in London , and that is one thing that I find very satisfying . . . But as an artist, it's difficult to work with him.|0
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine art I would not have finished it . If they did I wouldn't have made this film . They did do great work , but they have never done it before . The only thing that they have done better than this is make some of them look awesome . It looks like a great movie . You can't do this . The only thing is they are doing really well , it looks good . The only thing that they can't do better than this is make the first film .|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I was so impressed with it that it was actually my favorite film in the entire series . I really enjoyed it . I'm sure there would be alot of negative comments but it made me really happy . I can see it making some bad comments . It's got so much potential in the series but I'm sure it will change in the sequels. That was the best thing for me because I was able to see the first film I actually wanted.|0
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I think that we need to take that into account . . . I don't know if Rachael will ever get married . How much is this going to cost her if she doesn't make a commitment ? . . . Is this something they can do , or is it something else , maybe she wants to do so , or should I take her? . . . . . I don't understand . . ?|0
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
"No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . . . , . . , I would be more interested to find the original . . . and . . . But that’s been over a month now and I’ve got nothing to be concerned about. Hmmm…

I don’t know if there was a problem or a bug. If so, it would be too bad but I’m sure there are other bugs and/or bugs I need to get rid of."|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald, the one who was the main character of the entire film, is the main character of the sequel , which is going to be a much different film. As you can see on this post, I do not care what the plot is, however, I do think there will be another sequel . I mean the story . I am going to go watch this one . If you are interested in watching the movie I hope you will read all I wrote so far .|0
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't very well-formed, which is a big advantage to the rest of the series, and there is no other song that stands out as quite like the one they have been getting since I last saw it. And if it doesn't make sense, the series should be getting back to being an even stronger series than it was. It does have a long run of popularity, but I'm just glad it is back .|0
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson . And I guess it was only for me . It was also the only time I really didn't want to say it, so I was just making it up as I went along. I felt like I didn't want to say it at all, but I thought I should say it at least for myself and I had to say it a couple of times before saying it at a party, so I did.|0
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
"I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be one of his most popular movies and I couldn’t be happier with it! Here are some links of some of the best films that I have seen that I enjoyed:

There are some great films, I don’t want to get into all the other ones I mentioned. But if you are in the UK, it has to be in English. And you can also view them here. And here we are. Viva La Bamba!"|0
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic boundaries in a moment of crisis. In this time of unprecedented political change, and in the throes of the most dire economic crisis in history, capitalism has become the new currency of social and political upheaval. This is a time when all the forces of economic disaster, including racism and capitalism, have taken over the planet. In fact, it’s only in the context of this crisis and in the process of change that we can say, “Why are we fighting for the free market”?|0
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows many ideas, and has an interesting plot that's very much worth seeing

The main focus of the film is the role of the protagonist of the film. It is the protagonist who does not have an interest in the movie. The protagonist is a man, and that he does not really like the movie. If you think of a film in which this person will be portrayed differently than the character of the film, it is the film and the film."|0
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
"I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original movie , but when I checked the movie with the mainframe , it showed the movie with a different screen. Is it just me , is there a way to fix this ? Is it possible that the original movie is being broadcasted but not the same one? Is there anyone who has tried to do this , I really need your help

I have this problem, the original movie is getting broadcasted by the mainframe but not the movie with the original film."|0
Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story follows has some really cool shots for children. He had to have a very close up look to see how the camera would work. I know this will be the last time I post this film, but I thought it would be fun to find some great pictures from this series. I’ll definitely have to get to know this guy more, and he’ll have more fun with this picture later in the story.I will be going into more of this film as I learn more about my brother.|0
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. I have been writing about this show over the past two years, but have been struggling to find my footing since. I have watched it repeatedly, including on YouTube. If you have time, please do your research and see how it went. I’m sure someone will comment. Thank you! The Victim was not a bad film in my opinion, if you were looking for it, it was a terrible film.|0
If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933, he was living in New York City, NY as the proprietor of a hotel room where he kept a list of the zu'psi's which was then stored in his house. Now, I would like to offer some advice for those who are in the business of living and learning about their own Zasu's , as some of my friends are not in the business of learning and enjoying their zu's , but rather to share a part of their knowledge and experiences with the Zasu in the living or learning section.|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really. A few weeks later, it was released on Viacom as a downloadable content bundle, and has since been used for a variety of different marketing applications. It also features a great deal of promotional information, and we will be following it live on Kickstarter to see how it goes down. A few days prior to the trailer's announcement, we went to Google Images to see what would be going on. A bunch of the images had to go, so we decided to go with them.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere, who had just graduated from Princeton and is currently studying chemistry at Harvard, told me that he is still waiting for the director’s license to return. What he said is that they are very excited to have them back and hope they can work it out and find the time to work with a director like Louis. It was a long shot, but I know that Louis will do something different when the director takes it to the movies.|0
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is funny, but it 's entertaining , but it 's a bad mess . It was great for me when I was making a game that I like to create . I tried it and it didn 't work , but I still got frustrated with how I got so many bad jokes , and when I thought about the good ones , and I tried them all I couldn 't get them , I couldn 't get them .. , but I 'm not going to change that .|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and one that should have never happened '' - it was based on a common misconception of this sort of film (as was the case with many similar films in the past) that it was ""just a movie with a single character. '' In reality, these movies were written for a single purpose and not a common set of reasons as to why a person might have been killed or injured, or how to be a good actor in a movie."|0
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and my sweet, wonderful husband and my lovely sister, Jennifer, it 's all about making the best of the world with our beautiful little boys. This was all I could handle. I just had enough of it ... and I'm going to make it even better with Jennifer's help this week. She loves me and she is going to make all my things better. This week is going to be a special one ... so I'm excited for the weekend.|0
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about 15,000 different kinds of films every year. Brazil has produced more than 100,000 films, the majority of them made by professional artists. The production of many of these films is part of Brazil's very great tradition of producing and selling film on the public market. Most of them are sold in theaters worldwide. The biggest reason for buying these films is to make you feel comfortable in a variety of theaters around the world.|0
"This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira. They are both actors who play characters. I am so glad to hear this. She has done a lot of acting! I'm so happy to read all the feedback that you made. I have had a lot of good feedback in this blog and I want to thank you guys for your time. You are so cool. Thank you! Sunday, March 23, 2012

Last Friday night, I got a message from your husband."|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of the film make for a great read. It would make a good novel or a movie about the life of a single young man in the 1960s or 1970s. But there is a movie about the life of a married man. There is no telling how long he was going to be with his wife and children, or how much time they were going to spend together during the course of the next few years, or the fact that he was born in 1965.|0
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - a new day for the Romans in the face of a war that has become a threat to the Roman tradition. It is a battle fought in the open air, in the countryside and on the open ground; in the open land. In the Roman heart, this battle began as battle against a foe of the Romans , a battle against the Romulans. But when a man comes into the open land, with his arm around his enemy's neck, he can no longer do much fighting.|0
I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : ) This movie looks like a beautiful movie :D :D :D This movie has a lot of good scenes but I do not think they are good. My only problem with this movie is the ending. The ending is a sad ending and the protagonist has a sad ending too. What I think is a great movie but I do not understand the ending (The main character is sad). This movie was very good, it had lots of good scenes and it was not an ending.|0
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the New World . . . in 1873, from the New World to a Spanish settlement in Spain, he was arrested in a Sicilian convent, on the island of Santo Domingo. In 1874, he was brought on a tour of duty. The following year he was released from his convent. The following year also he was returned to Santo Domingo. In May, 1879, he was promoted to lieutenant and then lieutenant-composer.|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! We just had a great time in our lives, we just had a great time in our life, i’m sure they were all very happy that we saw this and enjoyed the show, thanks for watching :)

I would love to know where they went to, how far did you go? I think I’d like to know how much fun you did to be part of this event, it was really fun for me to see how you turned out."|0
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from one place to another. In such situations, the lover who loves him and who is in love may have a hard time getting what he wants. When the love is in your home and the lover is away, your husband or wife, you may find that he is not the best at what you want him to do. Some men, such as your spouse or wife, may find it hard to get what you want. But for others, like us, love is always present.|0
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it in our very first meeting, and I am really enjoying it very much. I had never been in a movie with a friend so I was very happy, I had been in the theater a couple of days now , and I’d never seen the original movie before. It was all just the same, you know? I don’t see much of it, but I thought the original was fine. I would have liked to have heard more about it after seeing it.|0
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the character himself . Makes sense to a certain extent . It 's actually quite good, at least compared to the film's other offerings , but the cinematography is still decent . But the whole thing starts out in a very poor direction . In a way, that makes it all a lot better . In fact, it starts out as it should have . It 's as if the performance was coming off the top . Makes the movie 's ending much worse than I was expecting .|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of work were lost in the production. This is what I call “post-apocalyptic zombie” . I’m very sorry, this is a new film and I don’t understand what to call it and I’m not familiar enough with the production to give it a shot. In this film the protagonist is living a nightmare. The protagonist of the movie has died and is in danger to live, and is being treated like an ordinary zombie.|0
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . The film is almost as good as a film from the beginning of the movie (or even the start of its own). It is, in fact, one of the better films of that era. The movie has its origins in the fact that Kersey had been living and working for a while, and by the time he got a chance to film after a series of events, he was quite well settled in the movie.|0
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to be around , I love her , and I can't wait to get back home for a visit with her ! Hi everyone, this weekend I had my first child . I got married this time . My daughter was in middle school for a few years . Then she was in middle school for three years then I got married. I'm now living in Los Angeles with my family for a couple years .|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and I finally realized it was a movie, not a reality. In my opinion it is much better than reality. It is a much more complex movie. But I still want it to be better. It's not just a simple movie that you can't find anywhere else. It has a lot of layers which make it not as complex as it could be, and I don't doubt that if you try to put it in it will still not work.|0
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . He is a funny actor . But I did it for my friends so when i saw it I didn't even think to mention the name Nicolas Cage. In the movie, I was told that there are two movies about him, so I thought of Nicolas Cage a bit. But I did not get the name . I thought that he was a manly actor , which is a strange thing , even when I don't know which movie is his favorite one , and the movie is called Nicolas Cage.|0
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys, though, don’t show up until the final episode , so you can’t do it in the beginning. I have never seen them, nor have I seen other people who did, before this series. And while I am not an expert on season 2 (as much as I am on season 1), I know it will be the first one. You’ll remember the first time there was a season 2 show, when a new character was added to it .|0
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a change from the first 2 movies that I've seen that was a great experience. I really like the movie. I really liked it, but I thought it looked like a poor second movie. It looks like a bad movie. I 'm sure I could make it work, but I'm looking for it in a good movie. I hope I can help, and if I don't like it, let me know. I'm working on it.|0
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described it in my head, but I don't think I have ever said it with my mind. As I said earlier, this one was so hard to say, but I think this is one of the reasons I didn't like it before. I was in high school when I wrote this book, I remember thinking that at first I thought it was really hard to say it, but after thinking it for a while, I realized I was thinking the right one, and I wrote it.|0
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched your video a few times and I'm very happy you got your video done ! But, i wanted to say a couple of things. This is not the first time I watched this, and it was probably my first time with a director. A lot of times it is the first time I saw your work and I was scared to say it, but that's what I tell you, that the work you do is amazing, it really gets you up.|0
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save up some time . As soon as we were inside the boats , we looked at the boats and when we went in we were looking at the river. Then we looked to see if they had seen us . Then we decided to go to sleep . So we looked inside the boats when we came out of the river and saw the boat . They were in the water and looked at the boats . Then we were in bed . When we saw that they were sleeping we turned around .|0
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock and pop. But there's not a lot more to it than that. If I were the director or even the cast member it would probably be better, but I've never been in a film that I think is that kind of film for me. There's so many characters you wouldn't want to have to worry about at the film's conclusion, but it has so much potential, you just don't have time for them.|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) as a young black who has grown up in the ghetto as his mother was killed by the mob in the 1960s. He can see the struggle against black oppression in the life of an African-American, but he is unable to become a real person without living in a world of struggle. He can be a person who can be a hero, and a friend to other people, and an activist to many people's world. The movie is an expression of black youth's struggle for survival.|0
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes some effort . For those who are trying to make a film of this sort you’ll have to be aware that this movie is based on a novel written by James Cagney . A novel is an idea that takes place after a long time , and after years . This movie is very popular . For those who are ready for a good one this would be the best one to see . The film is very funny . The characters are interesting .|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed the fine-tuned presentation, the film's audience loved it and now it's on its way. This year, the event was held for the first time on a weekend in July, which saw the UK's most prestigious and prestigious cinemas open for the first time since 1996. ( ) The film's release in Germany took place from July 11, 2013, until January 1, 2014, and is expected to be available for film in 2015 .|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , but for his teammates. It should have helped his team out in games. I wish he'd have stayed on, he was one of the guys I loved the most. The rest of us could have said no, the whole thing is just not right for this team. But it was a good thing for the fans. The fans didn't see it that way, it was good for the team, the fans were more than willing to take the blame.|0
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see what it has become. So I made it up, because it had to have been something that had come together and that was it, so that it wasn't like it was something that was going to happen. I think that this film has really caught the imagination of so many people and I hope that that will continue to happen. But I'm sorry if I missed it, it has been so lovely to see so many people talking about how good this movie is !|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because he is the best coach I know of his talent and his talent as an artist, but I am afraid he is the worst coach I've ever heard . He is a guy you would think you'd like to have , but you're wrong, I feel your pain , you know I know he is you're right , but if you can't be yourself , then who knows where I'd be  , you'd think you were an idiot , you'd be afraid  .|0
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for the award for the best animation director in 2003 , and won the Best Newcomer for the best picture in 2009 ), is the first to be awarded the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, the highest-rated award of its kind for animation. In 2007, Kim was named the Academy’s new director of animation in a ceremony in Hollywood in which she was awarded with her own award . She also won awards for her work in the animation industry including Best Picture in 2003 and Best Director in 2005.|0
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
"I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gearhart made it because he has a passion about movies and movies . Now I am really excited to see this film but it was only for 3 hours . It is so amazing how many movies you watched in the movie that you liked. I am not really sure what the 3 hours is but it is so good and i would love to hear your feedback on it. Please let me know . Thank you

I am so happy that you liked the movie."|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to read and the only thing that makes them stand out is how they are wearing their hair. The way the actors are acting in the movie is fantastic, and it's not as bad as it might seem to other filmmakers, but for me, it's very distracting and boring. It's a little distracting, but the movie is so good, I can hardly stand to watch it more often. I mean the guy is really cute!|0
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a bit different than what I would expect. I hope that you have enjoyed the film . You can check out the trailer here . I hope I get to see the film next time . If not, I'll keep you posted in case you are curious . Thanks for the review . You must have had a bad day of viewing the movie and I really enjoyed the experience . I don't have the budget to buy a theater, but I was looking for a theater to watch the movie .|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available right now but i would recommend it to anyone. I really hope it has been released by a new director so i will hopefully release it again . I have never had anything like this before and am glad i have found it so it can be seen by someone. I love this film but I would recommend it to any fans of this kind of flick. I've had it for years with only one shot of it but I am just now getting used to it.|0
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest on the screen . It's an all-star flick which takes you to some of the most dangerous places you've ever come up with in the city . Here's a list of films that you'll have to find your way through to find your way to . For a rundown of some more films that you'll be getting into in the coming week . There's always more to come . You've got to find out, and you've got to read it.|0
I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . If you are looking for some advice or suggestions about this movie then check it out ! As you know , they are based on a real life case of my daughter being shot by her father in a car accident . In a very serious way , in this case her father has had a very serious accident. In this case he has also taken her in for the first time , as a child , to get her father to drive the car.|0
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot is fairly interesting but it is also interesting at the same time. The overall animation quality is quite good, not the best IMHO , IMHO the story, and it is interesting at the same time . However, IMHO the story is better than the other . The movie has a lot of tension and mystery that IMHO . I just can’t understand how it could work . The story and the dialogue are interesting in this movie . This is a bad movie .|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written for the role of a man from the late-1880s in a series of characters who had just arrived in the city to be married and had to deal with the loss of their families. It was based on a novel based on Hilton 's story of finding a man and his wife living on a hilltop in the late 1880s. The novel is well written, much of it entertaining and an excellent read for younger readers who don't think of writing musicals about the era.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down to a place in the UK and found out that the original movie had been on YouTube . I knew this video was from an online site. It was the first time we’d used an online service like YouTube. I used to go into YouTube to do some research, and it was in this very place. I thought this might be an online source. I thought maybe the online source was YouTube? Now you can search YouTube for the title of the clip.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the film on my Kindle & I enjoyed it so much that I’m writing it again in a book. So I have this book I’m giving away on Amazon. A couple of months ago I had the chance to try the original film in a limited edition set and found that it was incredibly well done and was a good quality movie. This is a review of this film and how it was written and directed. I found it incredibly entertaining and a good movie.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since it is not only beautiful and memorable, but it will be the same as it was when they were shooting a scene in a movie. But that is not the point. What is the point, and what is the definition? The point is the fact that it has a lot to offer other than the fact that there is no real distinction between the movies. When I was at the cinema (now I am working on it!)|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but I have to say this is one of my most favorite movies in the world and it’s one of my favorites of all time. All of my friends in the world loved this movie so much I have never seen it before. And you know who you are and it’s so true. It is a very special movie but as I said this is one of my favorite movies in the world.|0
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following, I had a lot of movie-related information on the Internet. I did not want to be a film watcher, so I took the time to watch a film and read reviews. Now, after watching it, I must say that I can't really recommend it. It was not the greatest movie, but I don't think this would be it. After all, how can someone who has read the same reviews see a better film than another?|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it was in production and would shoot it live. The script was written by a man with a large beard, and has been adapted into many films. It was a huge success in the UK as well as overseas, and was nominated for several national and international films and was in the UK for many years after it was shot. This is one of those films I've never seen before in my life, so it was a big deal, but I never got used to that.|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who he was or how he was made, but I saw him from the back seat of a truck on a trip in the middle of the night . . I was amazed at what I saw . The Buddy Holly Story is not the same as a film, but the story of a boy who wakes up in his parents’ basement in the basement of the home with an older brother and goes to sleep with a girlfriend . He is the hero who ends up in a wheelchair for the first time.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 best movies of the year. Top 20 film that I want to see when I'm ready to give an award to! It's a movie that I love very much. In the movie the camera has been zoomed up to a very low level but it has to get back in your face to really take the scene in the beginning. It gets really annoying to have it zoomed in on the camera as it has to take the camera off the lens so that it's in front of the face.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience is over , but there is something special about him . You could be reading this book , read this and you will be surprised at the results , but it would really help if we did some research . In this chapter, we will learn that he has lost his father , which is why we want you to try your best to find out the true meaning of the name Sawyer, and why you can still find the book and read it .|0
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most of us, the people who read this article, would think about what I had to say. For instance, I have two children and they are very intelligent and well educated. When you have two kids who have to learn things, you have to learn everything. I don’t know what ‘learn’ is. I have two children, three years of age. For example, two-year-old in middle school. I don’t have to learn anything for two years.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
"`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , and I don't think it'd be right 'til this film comes out

It took a decade, two years, but it works. You'll find out more in the video below. It's more than an hour's worth of fun. I know I said I wanted to do it, because I had a lot of ideas! And I'll admit that it wasn't a complete waste of time. But I still like its style, and I still enjoy watching horror movies like this one."|0
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I was a bit surprised at the idea of making a movie. It was an awesome idea to do. I was only trying to make it because it seemed to me the easiest to make and because it is a bit hard to manage, it was definitely the easiest to make, to the point where I would be doing the movie myself (as if I would be trying to get my hands on something to do if it were an actual movie for a long time ).|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde back to my childhood and inspired me to try again after the reboot! I had hoped that I could get a sense of the characters in the movie because I have not seen a movie before and I don't have a full cast of characters yet (I'm not sure if they are related, but I'll get to that for the next post). The dialogue is a little dry and I think you can appreciate it better later.|0
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and not just cartoons in cartoons. If this was a cartoon and I were to find a picture, I would use that as a canvas for a comic. (If it's not a cartoon, it's just a picture and you can see what the characters, animals, etc., look like. For an example of what I would look like I would include the animals in a picture, including all of the humans, except I would look like a robot.|0
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
"Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this band so keep an eye on them as you come in, as you're going to find out. 2:00:45

You're not the only one that likes to pop on with music. If you're a fan of this band you know that it's really a pleasure to be able to get to hear all of the best acts of all time and bring you all the latest material and new music that you've never heard before."|0
My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen. One of those movies would get me on the boat. It was a very big movie in terms of number of shots, but also a little bit of time, I guess. It went up and down a bit, but it also had a lot of fun! So when I finally saw it back on the shelves I couldn't believe I'd been waiting for something else to be released! It was just about two minutes and a half, not enough time to make it out of Canada!|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as some of these films I saw, but that 's because it seems to me you get more exposure to die-hard fans at every chance, not because you are the only die-hard fan . . . you 're getting more chances for the die-hard fan . . . if you want to survive it you have to spend a lot of money and try . . . you have to keep your cool . . . but for some reason you are not getting as much of your exposure as some die-hard fans .|0
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does n't exactly give you the most memorable moments of any movie ever made , or at all , the ending is just as good . . . the characters are great, the ending gives the audience a little taste of what it's like to have your character live for a few hours , even if it does n't do anything for you . . . or at all , and there are so many movies that end up on the top of the list . . .|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) so I just got in touch and said hey I have some news... I have had quite a few new episodes I am sure that you will be happy with because they are fun and I have been reading the books on it. I hope that it is still going to be as much fun as the show itself is. I also want to add that the show is going to be great to watch even if you haven't watched it for so many years.|0
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , but it was a poor read at best. I loved the movie. i really liked the story but i was bored when watching it. the ending is not what i expected , i just thought it would make the movie even better. my only complaint was i didn't even get to see the movie as much as i hoped so i decided to see it again in the future. i hope you enjoy reading it as this movie has been great to watch.|0
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters by Columbia. The second was released on January 22, 2013 at 9 p.m. In June 2015, the film won the Best Director Oscar at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, winning it on a four-star scale. In June 2016 the film was included in the Netflix Original Collection Collection, which became one of the fastest-selling films in the Netflix streaming services in its class. It also received a Blu-ray release in a special Blu-ray release in July 2018.|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the birthplace of Pedro and his brother. In 1871, the village was renamed Pernambuco. The village is now a part of the municipality of Arras, a city located in Pernambucos . The town of Pernambuco is about 11 miles away from the municipality. The church is dedicated to the church of Jesus Christ, the founder of Antônio, who founded the village in 1879. The current building was built for the construction of the first military base in the early 19th century.|0
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . . . [The story of a young Valeria] was an emotional roller coaster ride. As I sat reading it I felt like I was standing in a world I had never really felt before. One of the best things that I have experienced, or thought I should have done, was reading an article about a character I wrote for “What Do We Talk About when the World Stops?” which was in the process of being rewritten.|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be thought of as one. It is a time of rebirth , or at least rebirth , of all that is real. It starts with our present self , which is defined as the body which we have to live by , or by our Creator , which is the mind we have to live by . As it were , the body is the soul of the present , not the past , nor of the future. It can only be our current self – the past , but that can only be a body.|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1

What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy in a ragged sweater, who has turned himself into a movie star . Or I mean a real actor . Or maybe a real role . Or a real show . Or a character . Or a real comic . It seems you've probably heard of them before, but at least you didn't get them. Or perhaps you never did . There were a number of funny characters in the show . You'll probably see some at first glance .|0
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge display case that you see above , it’s been a while since we last visited there . However, if you follow my advice and take a few minutes to visit all of the projects above, then I’ve been able to offer you all the links that I have shown in the comment sections above. But as I have a long way to go, I hope you will find my post interesting and also useful. I hope you find the information to be helpful too as it is.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I found the film to have a certain quality and texture which made it interesting and interesting . This film is a bit different to my original film . I am glad I had it. I was hoping that my original film could be something like this . I don’t think that it would have been possible . This film was a little more sophisticated than the original and I would hope that it would be able to achieve the effect I am hoping for . What is this?|0
"My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was the co-creator of the show and wrote it , I actually wrote it the second time , but it turned out this was the third time . I was so pleased with the show . So thank you guys for such great work on it ! Wow, I love your show! You make me laugh a lot , and I was hoping for a little more with your show. Do you guys think there are more than just ""I don't watch"" and ""I really don't think I watch"" there?"|0
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in deep with each other . As their names appear on the page the story is very interesting and interesting . When they go into the room the story starts to be interesting and entertaining . If you like noir and you don 't know what you are talking about in this story , it 's worth reading them . This is their first work . I think they'll be very surprised to know about their own first story . I know that they never had a clue when they 're going into it .|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
"I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO channel's show The Wire. I saw that you'd heard of it and thought what a great game that it was. And what was the difference between it and a 3-D game, like this:

How did you find the game, and where did you go to see it today? I was looking online at the web site and it was on one of the TVs on the corner where I was watching it from."|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like she’s a liar or a liar’s liar ), she is. She is in the middle of something that should have been taken to the police , like a murder. Libby is in the middle of what happened at a wedding in 2009 . The wedding was taking place in the same city in 2009 . I was with her for 3 days before we arrived , she was gone and the police arrived in 2 days . So the police are very interested .|0
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was a bad influence on me. So I said I was just making it and you can see it in the trailer. I don't think Paris Hilton could have had a better influence than a movie like this. I have some friends who are fans and they don't have a lot of movie ideas but I'm not saying she should be on the board. So what are some of these ideas you guys can try for the next film in the series?|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how important our cultural experience was when it was born and how much we spent our time thinking about. “This is a great example of what an art film can do for the viewer and a filmmaker,” says Amitabh Bachchan, CEO and co-chair of Film & Screens International, a non-profit advocacy group that is part of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for India (UNMIDA). He says there is great interest in this film in India and, like most film scholars, it is quite accessible to Indian audiences.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
"I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's been called an 'insane man' . I 'm sorry I was in a terrible mood. It was a bad mood, as usual, but it wasn't one I expected from Lucio. I wish he'd just said more about how the film was going to end, and he wasn't saying anything about that. There's only one thing we know for sure, and one that is going to kill the film for us."""|0
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It's hard not to love the show. I like how you have a huge cast. I do hate to see it continue as the second show. I have watched other shows, and I think the show will go on as long as the show lasts . It won't take a long time for it to end. It just needs a lot of talent. Maybe the show itself will take a long time , but maybe it doesn't .|0
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns and mowers! The world's most famous TV series is not that bad but that is what the movie looks like. In fact, the main character is Tom Cruise in the TV series, and that means there are two characters in the show. You can't see the character at the start of the movie but it looks like he's there! Here we have the characters of Tom Cruise to watch as well.|0
"I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there . I don't even think about it until after I read it

Lets say, if you go to the gym, I don't feel I would like to have to get to the gym to get to

So if I could just stay in my car that I don't like it. No, I think I would be happy that I didn't. I don't see any point in doing it as a way of getting rid of my anxiety."|0
This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are just so real. I just love the way the characters interact. The movie has always been a fun experience , it's a movie to watch on a Friday night , but in the past two or three years I've come to the realization this movie would change the way the world looks and behave. It's been a year and a half . I was very disappointed to see it as it's a movie to watch , especially when I had to take the movie with me .|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which is not at all well known in Britain . In fact, if you want to know the truth about this film, you have to know a lot about this film . And if you want to know what you can expect, you have to know all the facts. And, when you're reading it, you're not only reading about a book , but also watching it for a long time . It's a very interesting story , really. It's interesting .|0
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and it's very good! So we started with the story of the Civil War and it is a beautiful story. In this video we will explore some of the elements we will see in the film which are not in the plot but in the action. So as we can see there are a few very familiar elements and we'll start with a very familiar plotline with some interesting characters and elements which we'll later go on to discuss in detail.|0
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree with what you said, but at least it was a good one! . I was looking through the book reviews to find one that said the film was worth seeing. You can see it here and here. I was looking through the book reviews and I was surprised. I was just looking for someone to review the movie, I never found it. Also, no reviews were written for this movie. You should definitely go look for it if you want to see the movie at the theater!|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in and watched it in cinemas before buying it because I wanted to see the movie more. Also, I thought I saw a trailer of this movie on TV, I thought I might like it more than the movie I bought it for. But when I saw it in a theater, I wasn't impressed with the film. So here's to my fans who are watching these movies today . . . What are you watching?|0
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II. If that was the case, this would have to be the same story. If it was not the same for me, I thought it was for some people in the Middle East. So I got to see it this morning. The first thing we do when we leave for the first time is to have a view of it. For a very long time the first thing is to have a view.|0
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos. G was born in Chicago, IL on June 23, 1966. He graduated from St. Louis College in 1969 and received his BFA in 1975. He moved to New York City and worked as a reporter for New York Magazine. He went on to study at the Sorbonne in Paris for his PhD (1970-75). He also worked as a photographer. He moved to New Orleans to study film in the late 70's.|0
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
"Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD make more people read it !"" So, what would it look like? Well, you would have to write a lot of code, but, that's not really necessary. However, you could get a scriptwriter to write it. I've been doing it since the age of 4 - and I've used a number of it to get my first screen. Edit: This is probably not the most common use of the word - so I will not share."|0
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
"Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is one of them , and is still the best. Here are a few of my favorites:

This Is Not Just a Movie: The Movie. I wrote about it this weekend , but I can't remember which book I liked. It wasn't particularly good, it was really good. The title was pretty close to it, but I loved it, and it wasn't as I had anticipated. Fantastic Movie (2000): A Good Movie."|0
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
"I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed me by the sleeve, and I started to like it . It’s the kind of movie I love and the kind of movie that is worth a watch. If you are an avid movie buff, and you don’t need to worry about watching this movie every day, you are probably looking for some great reviews. Reviews from the last couple of years:

I watched this movie so often that I couldn’t find the time for it."|0
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' On Friday afternoon, the U.S. Secret Service was called by a young man who had been arrested after being charged with burglary for his involvement in a break-in. He had been arrested for possession of cocaine. He was released on bail and was later charged with possession of marijuana. A search warrant had been obtained on the home of an elderly man who had been killed when he was killed in the house in which his mother had lived when the house was empty.|0
"If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch this movie for too long then stop. That's it. The action is coming, and it will be awesome. Here we go with the trailer of the film so to be more clear on this issue. This isn't the first time that this movie will have been released, but it's actually the first time that it is released since the start of its career. The trailer is below:

In fact, I think that's the trailer for the film."|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store (I was getting a DVD for it). So it is really a great movie that is amazing. I always thought the same thing that the movie is great for the first time! I have never heard of it. The movie is so good and the sound is great. But the editing is also very good but the narration is still too long for what I wanted for my music. The narration is a bit difficult. I think it has to do with my voice.|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but there are many things that we would like to see in a film like his. I will not say that we will not say anything we would not wish to see. We are going to try something different, but I don't know what else to do. The story behind the characters and the characters are the same. In this film, I felt we should try something different. We want to know what it was like to learn the language, to try to learn a few new skills.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an example of why this might be important, but in this case there is no obvious reason to assume that the same result will also apply to the situation just mentioned. The next point I want to make in this example is that there is some other reason why this is happening. It is not entirely clear to me why this is the case in this situation but in any case there is a way to determine what the problem is.|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three years and I've only been back here once. I hope I didn't do too badly. But it's only been two years and I can't imagine why I don't get along with someone. It's almost been a long time . I'll do my best to find out . It's my first year here so I don't know what I would do in there. I have to be careful.|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this movie is , this movie was fun to watch , I liked it a lot while watching it . You have to read the reviews , not the review but the reviewer who read it , and you can see it's review by clicking here . This one was good but I would recommend this review to anybody who wants more reviews . Maybe this one was too good to be worth it , I don't think it is, but it was good .|0
"Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll find a few more, or a few more more. And you will find a few more. And that is what happens. In the movie I am talking about ""The Lost Boys"", it's about the missing boys and their friends. This is the first trailer for this film, the third trailer for a recent movie and the last trailer for a video game. So it is not just the story or the trailer that is important."|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about me, not about any other person. I had no intention of being seen in it except to make sure I understood what the topic was about, as well as to give myself an opportunity to have a good look at what I was experiencing, if it was worth it at all. What did I watch? I don’t want to spoil the story and tell you all I did have a good look at, what I did notice, what I saw.|0
"Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of this world to come...

...and see how we can make a full use of my latest research in the world of science and technology. I’m sorry I can’t be there. I’ve seen the world before, but I really can’t help but remember what happens when you have the time and energy to be there, when the time is right and the mind is there to help you to move the body and the mind into a better place."|0
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bartering with each other. They don't seem to have much in the way of financial issues, although they can be extremely effective when it comes to keeping a house. I would be happy to talk more with you as it sounds very interesting. On the whole, I do think you have a good understanding of my situation but I hope that I will have a positive feedback. I don't have much information with you here but maybe you could come to your own and write a review or something.|0
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and David Kornacki for bringing me back in to make this documentary, I just had to film that in real time ! I got the chance to do this film first-hand with my new camera , and now I've got everything ready to go ! It's very exciting to be able to do this ! I'm just really excited to be able to work with them ! The first time I've been working with them was in a video production. I'm very excited by their work !|0
"Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang is wonderful and a very very good masterpiece , in his words , ” In this picture there is a child. It is a beautiful child , She is a very good and very good actress ! !”

Mr. Im is in his 70th birthday , and has a very beautiful character ! He has an interesting story , that’s wonderful ! In a few days , he will be performing a film at the local theater . A great movie is a great movie."|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do love the idea of a beautiful little girl singing to her boyfriend's beautiful little brother, but as I was filming I noticed that she was singing to someone else and the boys are all very excited about her. At the end she sings back, it's so beautiful. And when you are singing it, there are a lot of boys singing about her, but they all love the love in her vocal. I think there should be more scenes like that because they're not just for the boys.|0
"Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been a plus )

Here you can see a little more detail as to what we have made for the food. We are just going to make sure to mention that as to what we made, it was very well done and made as easy as possible! This will be of great help with the food you have so far. As we have just shown it is a very easy one to make so it could easily be adapted to your own specific needs."|0
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a street in downtown Toronto. As they approach the corner they hear an unusual sound. In the street, a police officer and a man sit together, waiting to be apprehended. The man stands there with his hands extended in front of him. He is the officer in charge, with his bodyguard. James is standing in front of them, with his hands on the man's shoulders, looking down at his body as they wait for the officer to get out of the way of their pursuit.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing'. It's a comedy that seems a little like what I'd normally do for a movie, but instead the actors get to do a lot of crazy stunts, like running the house and jumping around and dancing with their friends. You'll have to pay attention to how that looks. Watch it for yourself and see if you think this is the right movie for you and if so, what are you getting?|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original cast and director who are both terrific, creative people and extremely funny. It was very good with the cast and director that they have worked with all their years of experience. The main cast and cast and director were all wonderful and they have made an incredible difference in the way they do comedy. It is always good to have a cast and director that work for your show. They have been great for the past 3 years and they deserve a lot more of accolades.|0
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . . . but I had the most enjoyable time . . . . . . . Now, I know it's all a joke, but for some reason it's the most intense movie I've ever seen. What do you guys think? You're really going through this, and I think that it's probably a great way to end up with some great movie experiences, because it keeps you focused on what you're going through, and that's what made it worth it!|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would have the same impact on the kids. I’m sure I could do it in 10 minutes but I know I should never think of it as a big movie. I’ve never had the chance of that before but it did happen. The first day of my life, I was walking on the beach, thinking “I know how to run and I know how to run. I’m not good at that but I’m always thinking about doing it”.|0
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be just the right combination of humor and plot. This was not my first time with this book. There are a lot of recipes in this book. If you know me personally and have read the recipe books in other cookbooks, you know that I want to try out this book, but I also hope you will enjoy this one as well. By the way, if you like cooking books for all kinds of reasons, check out a few.|0
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the dough when the only time they have to work out is when they're being asked by the press to make the bread. This film was shot at a private villa in the Netherlands, where it was filmed at different times during the war. ""Doughing is very much a part of life""
The film's director, David Morsch, who died on the occasion of his 50th Birthday, was very much a doughboy. He had to work his way up the ladder of fame."|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've seen since I was 10 or 11 . Gerrit Wolfaardt has always been a big fan of movies because of how they are supposed to move and move their characters. As you may have noticed, the films he is a part of today have the same kind of character animation that you saw many times on the television. But this movie was different and very different from what you already saw in his life. He 's a real man with a deep voice, and with a hard-headed way about it.|0
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it is not the only thing I enjoy doing . This song is so much about a man and how he feels that way . I like to hear all the good music and have always wanted to do more . The result is very good ... it is about one man , how he feels . I want to hear more from this amazing man . The story of the song is so interesting and I enjoy listening to it more often .|0
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this movie at AnimeCon in June of 2007 and I’m still waiting for it to come out . I loved it and I just wanted to get it myself . It’s really amazing what it has done for the entertainment industry and I look forward to it and I hope it does for the industry and hopefully one day I won’t need to have it . I’ll be watching it closely tomorrow and if I see something on the release that needs to be said .|0
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very clever movie. The movie shows you what to expect as the movie is made. It has some elements that you just don't see on a regular film. I was not a director of this movie as I was never one to watch movies and I didn't like the tone of the films. But it was entertaining to watch the film on DVD. It was really entertaining. And I was amazed that it could be so entertaining. I liked the acting and acting style.|0
When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who is one of the most influential women of her time and who is best known for playing the role from the 1970s to the early 1980s , was a brilliant character and a great influence on many of her books and films of her time. Although she would not play any role in many of the movies her role was still popular in the early 1990s , she played the role in almost all of the later films, including the early 1990s.|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing ... But I will not lie and make you believe it. My husband went out of his way to be a good friend of mine ... and told me he did not believe it ... He also said that if it is not your friend's fault, you are not worthy to be your friend and I don't care if it is your friend's fault but you must believe it. You must believe it. And you must be your friend to the best of your ability ..|0
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I'm amazed at that) but as a movie, it is not the best kind of film. It is one of the best in the business. However, I feel as if I should mention that it doesn 't get better. There is a lot of humour, there is a lot of suspense, and the plot is all that's left to say. In the end, I think it 's one of the most memorable films ever made.|0
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values of the actor are just what we need to succeed. We are looking forward to seeing the movie and know that the audience will enjoy it even more. When the film begins we will see how he plays with the actors. The actors will not be the only group of actors that is playing, but the characters will be the best and most memorable characters. For this reason the final scene we will start by making sure that you get the story of the actor that has been portrayed.|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are so fascinating and wonderful are breathtaking and awe inspiring ! I don't believe that you can find a lot of images like these, but if you are interested in what they are, then I will make you a very special gift!! I love all the work they do here and hope they get you to take the time to listen to it and enjoy! What I love so much about this project is the quality of the images!|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific moments in the story, but this was all very well said. But there was more than that, and I think the reader can appreciate the point I made. All the way down, you start to have the sense of an emotional connection to a character. You’re feeling a connection to his/her emotions, and when he/she is upset, this is going to get hard to hold on to. Then you get back to the emotional state you were at in the story.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared of them and the same with the horror films. It is my opinion, the best horror movie in 5 years .. for the best horror movie, the best horror movies in 5 years, that you 'll find in a long list. The best horror movie is one of my personal favorites for every time you 've found one. There 's a lot to think about and the most important of all the horror movies is the movie horror and horror story.|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes on to fight in WW 1 he is the only member of that band that fights for the nation.In that film Charlie wins a gold medal for his effort. The film continues with the battle against the enemy in a world where it is clear that Charlie would fight for his country to become the first black man in history to win the war in the United States. At first, the film goes on to tell us that it is the black man that will win the war.|0
"This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the 3rd episode. There is some interesting stuff here. I guess I am trying to figure out why they don't like them and it is the only reason they like it. I am thinking this could be the clue to the truth of the whole thing. Columbo 1.9:







If you look over the episode, I think they are saying that you don't need to get in a fight with her. If she has the chance, that's a lot better."|0
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake , its an amazing film in the first three minutes, but the second half is an incredible movie . Now if there is a movie in which some of the plot and characters are very strong , that is very powerful , but you will never find that in a movie when the plot of the film is the main focus of this movie . But this movie is the only one that will be strong , so what is your opinion on what I should do ?|0
"In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that has become the world's largest amusement park for the first time for the second time. If he's been on a cruise for five to 10 years and was a stowaway for his life, you're probably in luck."" ""Maybe it's time we went back to it?"" ""Sure, it's a chance. We just got a little bit of a windfall. We just have to find somebody who's going to do it."|0
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an old movie . '' The movie was filmed in New York for a month , in fact it was filmed there for one month , in fact that is true , but this was filmed there for one month , and that is true , but this was also filmed for a month , and this was also filmed in New York , and this was filmed here in California , and that is because that is where the movie actually is , because it is such a great movie and it really was filmed here.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really cover everything. This is very much like the original, it just covers everything and it's a great story with good character. You will need to do it again to get the original. You will need to read the rest of the episodes, but here is the first, where I put the focus on the characters and characters that I will be looking for. For now, you can find out more. This is a great and detailed episode.|0
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both seem to be in their respective strengths for the film . The film has been released on DVD , Blu-Ray , Blu-ray 's, and VHS . However, the movie has never seen a major release . Despite this, there is yet another DVD release . The film has already seen two DVD releases , which means that a DVD release is a better way of viewing the original movie . If you do not have a current release in mind, watch the movie.|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening night, and we were very happy to see everyone there and to see a film in its own time! So to sum it up, we’d never seen a film like this before, and it looks fantastic! It looks like a movie about a family. It will be pretty awesome. For the record, we do have to mention that there’s not much to say about this movie. It’s a classic love story of a girl with a kid’s name.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I have been following him since the last week. I always like his writing, but this time around I am curious how he is feeling. He is tired. I have not been there in the summer but have been in the summer and have a great week. It is hard to say how he is going, but a lot of fans are excited and looking to get to know him and his family more. I'm glad that he is here.|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with a knife and his own life as a serial killer — and he’s right, I guess — in the form of a “woke-house” in New York’s Museum District. This story is part of a series of films in which we’ve teamed up on a theme for the first time in the history of comics, which, like most art-driven projects, is also the subject of much discussion in the comics industry: The Man and the Wagon.|0
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and charismatic voice. He was very smart and funny and made me laugh! He is a fine actor! He does a lot more acting than anyone else I have known. I have a great relationship with his actors and friends. I’m not too impressed with this film but there are many good ones, and I am sure that there are many new ones, but I am going to give it a shot.|0
"Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that centers around a group of fighters who travel to a distant land, learn about what it means to fight for the United States, and how to get back to civilization. Review:
""This movie was a lot of fun, though not so much in the way that it made you think and get into it""
""He’s going to get a few more years in jail, but it’s worth it""."|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I had to use up all my money just to get out of the place, and I don't really know what it was, so I had to pay for it. Now, when I take the money I have to get it to the door. I have to get it out, because I have to leave the building. If I had the money I would be spending it off of my wedding ring.|0
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of people started making their money at theaters. But it never happened . . . until at some point in the 80's a guy came in and he took the money and told a friend that he had got his money's worth out of ' the money. I told 'em I hadn't been to the theater with 'em, they said, but they said they could make me out of 'em. A couple of years later I got paid for 'em.|0
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it as it was a very good film for me . However, it was not as good as we had anticipated . We had only just seen it two years ago . It did look pretty good but we couldn't explain it as well as it seemed like it should have. We ended up with a better picture. Here we go . This is a very interesting film to have. I would say it is a bit dated.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another “solo movie”. Instead, the film was praised as “the film’s most beautiful work.” And in an interview with Deadline magazine in December, the writer of the article claimed that the movie did “make” its audiences laugh, not cry, in part because the film is not a great movie for adults. In the interview, the author claimed that “[i]n the first half of the 20th century, it had no such effect on the public.|0
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation film. You’ve just made a picture of a guy in shorts, a character in action and they’ve all done it. This is the story of a guy who wants to go back to where he came from before the world changed in the 90’s and what he has to do. You’ve only been to Disneyland before and now he wants to go back and see all these things he knows he can’t get.|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on his own at his own rate, to do his own thing and to get away from it. He gets caught on a train, but it turns out he does not like it. One day, he discovers that he knows a few things that he does not know, such as the way his parents' lives are in a very different way than the one he thinks they have in real life. So he decides to set up his own school and get a scholarship.|0
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
"I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this show . . . . What a great evening! Spike Milligan, one of the hosts, got on with his evening's performance. The performance took place on February 22nd in his mansion and he was introduced to all those people who would watch him before and after. As he explained:

I wanted to have the opportunity to present a performance. I was very nervous. I couldn't get on stage, so I was not doing anything for me."|0
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
"this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall it is good fun. Hope you like it and if it's not good it's good enough as a sequel to the first movie. If you want to watch it for yourself it's hard to beat a movie and if you want to watch the movie for your friend it is worth it

Wow this review is very well written and is so well written I can hardly stand it and I don't understand why there aren't more reviews out there like this."|0
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause i cant say i am the most experienced movie star i've ever come across. ive seen it a lot. i do say so because i like the acting that is the best part of what they've been doing. ive seen it since i started a family and its been one of the main reasons that i like to go out. so i can say its one of the main reasons why it is the best of the last three films.|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . I loved the music in the film and I can't wait to get to play the soundtrack! I don't mind playing the soundtrack but I have yet to see a live recording. I've been told I just want to hear the live music but I'm not sure if it is possible! I am hoping for the live version of the soundtrack but it will be the live version of the song, as well as the lyrics.|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he ever did was even in his 20's and he really didn't even know how to use a computer. He's no stranger to tech - he's a computer genius, a software engineer, and a musician. I've never heard anyone even mention tech at all and I've always loved watching him grow. He's pretty amazing, but he's probably not going to be seen in movies or television, unless they do something for him.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps all the charm of the place and makes it a popular tourist destination for locals and tourists alike. Also a wonderful movie showing the beauty of a very beautiful and beautiful home, while still being enjoyable. The movie was filmed in a villa by a very nice family who were really pleased with how they were able to enjoy it. A couple of the scenes they saw in the movie have been changed for a more realistic look so that the characters have more of an attitude and they are very good actors.|0
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis the Menace , a comedy, was directed by John G. Fox , and in his movie ''Doom''. He made ``Doom''. It was also an ``Doom''. '' '''Doom''' was an all-star comedy directed by E. L. James, and features the main cast , and was the first production of a ''Doom'' film since the early 1960s , and was a classic of American humor .|0
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling dialogue. But after I watched it and saw the actors from the first movie in the series I thought it was funny. As far as I can remember the dialogue was pretty well detailed and the dialogue was very good, the acting was great and the casting of the actors was fantastic. It was very well shot and filmed and it turned out great. I had been looking at the film and it was like it was in motion and not like a motion picture.|0
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of my favourite films and I am so very happy for it . But I do not think that it 's the best movie I have ever seen . A very well presented and very entertaining movie

I hope you enjoyed this review! There have been many requests for the DVD. Some of the requests were so good that there was a lot more to it and it was very well written. Here is the final review

I would like to make my comments."|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a really bad time. I just wanted to go to work and say hi. He did, and then my husband didn't. He was like, I have to make it. It's not supposed to be funny. So yeah, I'm trying to be nice, but I just couldn't resist it. I love this movie. I just couldn't help myself. I love this movie, too. And I love that it's on DVD.|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections on 8 June 2012, the Opposition accused him of committing an act of sexual deviance against her and claimed the Prime Minister had ‘hollowed’ him and ‘became ill-suited’. The opposition said the Prime Minister had made it clear to the Opposition that Ali G is the candidate, and “would not have been chosen in the first place”. This was in reference to the incident in Parliament where Ali G has repeatedly made it clear that he would not be the candidate.|0
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
"That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is to say the least. As always, here are my top ten best films of 2017. Cinema of the Year

I love this movie. And it’s certainly one of my personal favorites. The Man With the Cross-Mesos is a fantastic documentary, but I’d say the film should be viewed by the average viewer for the first time in the documentary genre. I saw it on a TV and it didn’t make my mind up but I’ll do it."|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his brother . He decides to have a child and to take the chance with a new one .

TyNesha, who feels that the life of the young girl is being taken up with a new boyfriend .|0
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is cleverly crafted by a team of experts, this article is meant for people who do not yet understand and who want to learn more about the art of dialogs. Here is a list of the best dialog dialog games for Android and Apple. The first game for iPhone is a pretty straightforward dialog. It is really easy when you click the link. When you type in the text and you are told to type it in, the next step is to select the text to put in the dialog.|0
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was the only actor who had the best performance in his career . I mean I know Cagney has been around a fair few times so maybe the film has become a lot of fun . And yes I think he had the best performance in a film . Thanks for giving me the chance to give him your opinion . Thank you! It's not a great film but it's still a good movie. I think that the way it is made and adapted is a bit more of a story for the characters.|0
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona and his stage presence become the defining features in the musical . In this, Garlin will not only have a great time with the cast and crew , but as the film progresses he will come to understand his role in the musical as well . Garlin is a strong believer in working with producers and producers that they are working on this project . He says that if you do not want to see this production, you should be working with a producer.|0
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the same standard as the last one in its original, the story is more than that . . . it's not that great . . . it's really just great . . . This movie makes an appearance in the book of the same name . . that's what it looks like . . . and that's how the movie gets the title . . I can only think of two possible explanations of this movie's success. First of all, the movie is very good .|0
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had to be released a year after it was first released. It wasn't until Christmas that it was actually released. However, when the release date is released, there's no doubt that people are going to love it, which is exactly what happened with the series finale, which we'll get to when it gets released in the next episode. And that's because it's an episode that everybody should be looking forward to. It's just one episode.|0
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a big-picture director and producer of a TV series called The Twilight Zone. His credits include the original feature-length film The Twilight Zone from 1998 to 1999, and was nominated for a Goldwyn-Meyer Award in 2003. Fulci died on January 23, 2012, at the age of 95. He is interred at the Church of St George Cemetery in Los Angeles. Fulci is interred at St. George's Church in Los Angeles and Chapel of the Savior in the Cathedral of St. George the Virgin Church in Santa Monica, California.|0
"Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also means that in Sweden and Switzerland, it's really not a bad idea to watch it ! If I am watching it for the first time I will probably be disappointed that I don't watch Stingers . But I find it a wonderful way to watch the game for the first time , but I can't take it anymore . I don't love Sting but I don't like Sting . Quote

"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling. It's not that Fulci's performance has been lacking in modern cinema as much as it was for some years previously. And the result is that he is, as far as the studio can show, still working as a director in his early twenties. He's not the only film maker who's come through, and that's certainly one of the many reasons why you think he's a good actor. You have to ask yourself if there's any way you could do this in his work.|0
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I'll give you the rundown. It seems to me there's something I don't understand. Why aren't Showtime doing it? And why does it have to be something they've written for it? I can't find out for sure and I'd like to know. But as a result of my reading it seems they haven't. And then, as I said, what I mean here is why is that and why aren't you trying to explain this?|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother and I in my head) and the Internet as a whole has not seen it, I'm hoping that by now it has. That is, of course it has. It will make me happy. So let me know if you have any more information. I'll be sure to send you any new stuff, and I hope that you'll have a wonderful time. I'm happy to hear from anyone that was interested in watching.|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only comes to your attention after reading that. It was not a movie I had ever seen, but because I had seen a few episodes, I realized that I have been watching a few more episodes and now I have had enough to go back and try my luck again. This is a film based on a novel by Charles Dreyer. As I’m typing here, you’re probably wondering why a film like “The Aristorcats” has such a bad reputation.|0
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any of the plots to appear on screen ? !!! If this is what you want to show , i am sure you'll have a lot to learn . I have a lot of questions about this, but in my case , I have a few answers to my questions. As an aside - what can you suggest to me that would be really helpful? What is the plot for this series, and how does it relate to the show?|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . I have never seen the movie . I have never even seen any of the films . . . This was my first day with the cast , and my first experience of the movie . I was surprised to hear the name of this movie . The actors are very nice , they make a strong impression . The main character is a young lady with a great story . It has to be great , she has to act as a little girl and that’s what they do .|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've read these days I have come to think it's all a joke . But this is an idea I have been wanting to explore in a few years . . . I hope to come up with a few ideas as to what it might be, but the time and money involved would be very much appreciated . . . If you would like to discuss it with us or any of the people interested . . . Send us a message and we'll get you on the front page .|0
I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very interesting. I like to think of the audience and the writer as the ones who are in charge of what we do as well as in what we make. I can't think of a better place to begin my film. And the film was great to make so it's been very rewarding to have this kind of relationship with a writer, so it's also a really nice way for us to continue to do something together.|0
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks in my time, some of it pretty good. However, there are still a few bits that are pretty bad. The one scene I saw was where the vampire who has taken the lead in the previous film was shot dead and his head was cut off . He was killed by a body in his house . He was shot to death in a bathroom in a home . A lot of the dialogue was made up.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient , the movie about the relationship between the patient and the leopard and its story'' has recently been released. The film was one of a number of films where the actor had to do something that he had to do. It was also a very popular film because it is not just a joke, it was actually a real joke that the film itself is not. This made the movie really popular and in many ways was not the first film to have this kind of story.|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors of the attack had not been able to see anything on the deck and had taken only a few photographs. The next time we went ashore was on Saturday night, October 13, 1986, and was the first time that we had seen a boat. This time we found the wreckage. It was made up of a lot of pieces, including a large piece of iron. This is what we found, when we saw it at night.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with a cast, and an engaging story-telling with an excellent cast. The film will premiere on 13 March 2017 on BBC Two, at 10.30 CET (UTC +9) on Friday 23 March, at 9am IST. The film will also be shown at New York International Playhouse . The first film of the film, The Battle of the Battle of Hill Street (1962), won Best Actress for its portrayal of a soldier's battle over a bridge, and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress .|0
The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the originalkees , but even though I don’t remember who the original, I remember the Monkees who made the best of them . I mean , they’re a pretty good band, and it’s the same as they were for the rest of their lives . So, I’d say that if they ever did, this would be the Monkees , and if not it will be the Beatles , and yes, they’re going to still be in the game .|0
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and in the last few months , I've started to get lost . I'm on a mission . The first thing I noticed when I was about 20 was my hair . I always wear it just to wear a hat and my face is always visible at the top of my head as I look in the mirror . I have no idea where the hair comes from or what it looks like . Is it something that I'm looking at when I am out here ?|0
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. Maybe I can get through to them now, because I think they're looking at us, and they need to work on their relationship, and I think they need to get a little more involved in our relationship so that they can continue to grow together and find a common purpose. They need to find a common purpose and find a way to make us happy. I love what I've seen, but there are so many more movies than this I have missed out on.|0
`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of gold, for which he is certainly one of the funniest characters on the series. He has been cast as ''Kissed, '' in the film'''s ''Olympia''. He's not an actor , but he's intelligent , and has a fine sense of humour which can be put to good use in any situation. One of his first big movies was ''Tristan Haller'' and it was a smash!|0
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to the immigration issue by my mother , and her father . So I went to a lot of the world's capitals and did my research on the subject , and it was my first time doing a research on immigrant experience . Before this book was published, most of the writers who have published books on this subject were working on the same thing.So I found out about these books a little bit earlier , when they were first published in 2008 .|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things , I was looking for someone with my experience, I am going to go on with your review. So if I do what you say, I'm happy with it, I know I could have done some other reviews. I will try to explain myself more in a few weeks or months. Thank you for your feedback, you have made a big difference to my book. Good luck to all of you.|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an evil boss in the latest Oscar-nominated remake of James Bond. Madden was asked if he would consider playing a female role in the remake. ""Yes. I would love to see the roles,” said Madden. He said that the idea of playing such a powerful woman was the first of his dreams for the film. “I imagine she’s a great guy and a great director and the only problem she has is that she’s played to perfection in terms of the movie,” he said."|0
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
"This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Takes place at an old school building and shows a little boy in the corner.He is pretty cool with a bit of color and lots of food.You can check out their page of the movie here.My first thought is if he was a bit different from the rest of us he would have to be different.But no that was the problem because he's just a very cute dude. It looks great on your screen so i have a few questions for you
1) How old is this movie??"|0
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that a movie that looks like an actual real person , has some good sound. A movie that makes you realize this is real , doesn't it? This movie is a must-see if you're looking for the real thing. Also , it is an excellent way to look at something that you've never heard of before , and it really works well for you . However , the film does have its moments , especially its animation.|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in St. Augustine, Fla., on Monday, April 21, 2010. A few months ago it seemed a good time for him to make a stop at a candy store and get a taste of it, so to celebrate that day it's all about the Buddy Holly Story. He's looking forward to seeing all of the new and improved pictures on his Web site as soon as it's published. The Buddy Holly Story is the tale of two young boys who discover that their dad has died unexpectedly.|0
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz, who is an amazing actress but she is also very interesting as an actress. I'm sure there are plenty of Oscar contenders who will do well, but I will be very interested to see which one is going to come out well. You know how I can watch a film with a little bit of care. I would be very pleased to do this one if I were to be in a film, but that would be very wrong.|0
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness.'' I guess it can be argued that in a world where I don't live, we live in a world in which we have no political power. That's not true in my world of mine, of course...but it doesn't mean that I've never lived in a world without the political and financial forces that make up the government. I lived, for example, in a world where there was no money in the treasury and everyone had to earn it.|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architectural style. With his great-grandfather, Nathaniel Kahn, a self-taught craftsman, the architect has the courage to build a large home and set it up in a modern, modern-minded fashion, with a view of the past. In the film, we meet a young man named Charles Kahn, with a long history as a successful designer. He was born to a Polish family in the town of Ząbrowski, today in the city of Śląszcz. This small town was known in Europe as the 'Nathaniel's City'.|0
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more, but they never mentioned this as an issue to anyone. But I don't think it's a matter of whether this is the case or not. I don't feel that there are any complaints in this book. If anything, it seems to be quite clear that this book makes the reader think more critically than any other books that have been published over the last several years. I can't help thinking that this book really was intended as an introduction, rather than as a critique.|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how she got to have the title. It is the story of all the young girls in the movie. I 'm just wondering how she gets to know them. And I hope she can learn a little bit from them later. I don 't think this movie is going as well as you may think (but if it were to be the best movie of the whole series I 'm not sure how much good I'd be at it lol).|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce a TV program for a limited time if they do not have the Internet to download it. The Internet can also be considered a small amount of space if a user is unable to access the Internet. This means that users are not able to use their TV to listen to their favorite TV channel. With the proliferation of the Internet, the cost of TV program production and distribution has become so high that the user must be able to purchase and use a set of equipment and accessories.|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but there’s also a supernatural element when you play in a cinema. That means that you don’t just shoot a movie, as the film’s acting and cinematography makes it easy to pick up the pace. But the supernatural can also be an element in the story. The most commonly described element of supernatural elements is the story, which is why the supernatural is an extremely popular element in the film genre. As an example, the story is actually a comedy.|0
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to have a main character but it does because it did. Not that this movie is wrong. Just that it wasn't supposed to have a main character . The main character is not a super villain of course. And I can see why people would expect it to. I don't care if the main character is a character and you are talking about a really big guy, it really shouldn't have a main character. And if it does, then I will not be surprised by it.|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I love the characters but the action and the plot are just not enough ! ! ! ! ! ! This is a story that has to be done to be funny! I love action movies and this is definitely one that is not easy, but this is my favorite action movie I have seen before. It is just so hard to choose a bad action movie that doesn’t deserve to win.|0
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There are some good movies to be seen . I would say that for me , it's just a shame it's not seen in a very nice movie . And if you go to a theater, you can find some great movies that are better than this movie . It doesn't look bad , but the movie I'm talking about is pretty bad , it's not good . I love movies , but sometimes they don't go to the right place , and they can't be viewed by everyone .|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 years old, she was married to her father’s daughter when she was just a little girl. But we were watching a movie that made me smile. Here’s a video of Lana Turner showing the film on her screen. I love the way you think about her. This was made when I watched the movie. I think this is the coolest movie ever. Oh my God, she looks amazing! I love that she had a big body and legs!|0
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea). She was kidnapped from school by her classmates. The only reason she could find is because her friends have called her mom to tell her she had a break-up . So, when the teacher tells her to get a new job, she makes her new job the next day . This was one of those movies . But I was so nervous! And she was so scared to leave her home and go to college . This was one of the most frightening moments of the movie.|0
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction was very well done. In this film, the audience were really impressed as they were treated to such a magnificent presentation. The story was told from the beginning to the end of it. This film is a great example of the cinema and storytelling that we have all seen before. The story and the film itself were very effective. The music is good. I think there is still more to discover in this film. This is a great, great film.|0
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with its lack of a good plot. If there’s a plot you think we’re all going to hate at the moment, then read this one, and if you want to make a point, you’re going to need this book. The Matrix trilogy, based on the Harry Potter series, centers around a group of people who’ve come to grips with the power of magic and decide what their next moves should be.|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
"A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at least one occasion, I found this weird to be something I was really, really, weird about : . This is weird, and really weird.It happened to me that way... :

On the first occasion, it turned out to be one of the most difficult episodes to write about. (It was a very strange scene, and I've always been a big proponent of writing stories about anything that you can get your hands on."|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the `` dark house ''' movies and discuss what is missing in the '' dark house '' sub-genre'' of popular culture. As we continue to discuss these movies, we will discuss what it was like when you first met the new dark house, and the ways you can use it as a stepping stone to a wider range of television shows. The new dark house '' '' is one that you can look forward to for years, but it's still the most popular television show in existence.|0
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs etc. As a film about a man's gay life, you really get what this story is going for . It's a love story , a story of life, sex and sexuality . It's all about gay people . And if you love this story so much you want to have a film about it . In this story, we get to see some of the gay stories in the gay community, which you will see in the movie. What's in this story?|0
"A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling can take you away . There’s also a lot to find out in the process of making a film! We are here to help you make a film in just a couple of minutes! Reviews

Reviews of “Frozen” have been shared over the years, but have rarely been shared in reviews. We’ve taken a couple of reviews off the top here, but there’s one review that is still a great fit for me."|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you watch this film you really can't say it was good but it did give me this idea of a story and I was a little worried because I've only watched a handful of movies. I really enjoyed the movie because it was so fun. It was really entertaining, but I am a huge fan of this movie. I like it a lot because it gave me something I could relate to. The storyline is very good but the story was a little bit difficult to follow.|0
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of this movie being released before this year. It is a terrible movie and this movie can't be made again, but it is not a bad movie. It's not a movie, but the fact that it is made is that it was made. It's just so horrible it could not have gotten to theaters . This is the first time someone is saying it is a bad movie. If you want to watch it again you must see it again .|0
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to say this was one of my top ten favorite movies, so it's kind of strange that even if I like it, I haven't watched it. I haven't watched a single film since 2010, so I can't really explain why it's so good. I don't even understand why, but it's a great film for the movies. I watched it a little bit but it just felt so much better than the last year I've been on this site.|0
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in love and love for their own child. I would love to see that same romance in every girl or man of their own age. It is important for me to remember that there are more than 20 of us in the world , and I want to go back to that experience and to the stories of the grown-ups who came to this earth. I love to hear the stories about the people that have been around for so many hundreds of years and have always lived to be 20, 30 years.|0
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
"I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For that you can go to the right website. You can see some pictures of the house as well as the picture gallery. And here's what I found on the internet : ""You need to buy the film from the shop. They should have it in stock right now and you can get it on your phone."" It doesn't even have an email address to the website. You don't get an email from the store if you buy it."|0
"This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun ! I still have a hard time with it. But I did it and it has been really good. It was very funny and it wasn't that bad ;P

I had never heard the story before, so this is an improvement. But, this is the version I have to read right now :D This was one of my favorite movies in recent memory, I love that story! And I read the whole book."|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I am saying that it is just not right . I really do think it is the most entertaining movie I have ever worked with and the only one I have ever made. I do hope the audience will take the next step . I think it is because of this movie that it is still the best one to work with . I have written this book for many years and I am so glad that I finally had time to write it.|0
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
"David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary book. Attenborough describes how, as he describes in detail, wild animals and their stories , and how they were the inspiration for what he called ""the wild animals of old"" . He was one of those who were fascinated by the animals in the book. As he described the way they appeared, he saw how they ""had a variety of sounds, and they moved from one to the next, sometimes like moving animals in a river."""|0
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name. It follows the story of Hari from a young girl, whose father is a famous doctor who helps her to get back her old life. Hari's father has always had a fondness for his young son, and he is able to play the role with ease. Even though he's a criminal, Hari wants to prove that she has a true love for him. In this way, she is able to take care of the family's needs.|0
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need more than this . You need more . As you know I'm writing this article to show that in the US it's almost always a problem if there's none or the majority of people who feel this way, it's because the majority of people do. I mean if you want to find out if it is true that some people don't have this problem because of some other reason, it's possible. But in most cases, you don't have to do it.|0
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight was doing the most good work . But this was the one I wanted , it is not easy to watch on any one of us . If we watched it it was a waste ! On one hand, this show is a bit dull - I can see them both wanting to kill eachother in a show, and if they had a better chance of destroying eachother in the end, they could have a better chance of beating us in a fight.|0
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could wish for' but it's worth every penny you'd get from a decent film like this. If this is the only example, then it could be the only time that a movie that has done this has been able to do the opposite. If it's not, we might get another example from the same movie. But you know, I'm sure there is more to film than this. I'm hoping for the best part.|0
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Shakespeare and of Edgar Allen Poe. When I saw the original of this film, I was a little excited, because I thought that was such a fun film . It's a great way to see all these characters at their best . It's like something that's happening to an author when he talks about Shakespeare. It's actually a wonderful way to hear what he's talking about and to see a great actor.|0
"We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. Its a pretty unique film. The theme of the film is ""Rise Up!"" You can see a couple of trailers in the above clip

The film itself is based on the works by La Spettatrice

In the trailer below, there is also a video with La Spettatrice as a guest star for the festival, which has been made available via the film’s website. The film itself is set in Venice, Switzerland, where the film is to be staged."|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life now ) they’ve been talking about how they’ve had a really nice experience over the past four years. At first it seemed like they were joking that they had to have a great experience with this movie, but to get them really excited at least they decided to try and make the experience better. They’ve had several other great experiences too as well, but this one did just as much to the point where the experience was actually really satisfying.|0
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch my life on my laptop and I'm still trying to get into it ;-) Now I think of as my life, but not my computer. And I don't want to stop. It's not the way I'm doing things and I want to get to the point where I'm doing the best I can with it, but I want to see it through to completion. Maybe it can be done better than it was, I don't know.|0
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think will be made into a movie for everyone . . . , and I thought it would be a much better release for me to give you the option . . . but I'm getting frustrated . . . you know how I think . . . . . you can't wait . . . but I can't . . . you think . . . you think . . . . but this movie will be amazing . . . this movie is very special .|0
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the movie is in the DVD . But I really hate it. I think the problem is that there are a lot of people in this world who think that people are stupid, stupid. But I guess that is understandable. So I'm just glad I've found this site. I like it better than it ever was. I hope it doesn't end up getting banned . I don't want my kids to get mad, but I know you can do the things that you're doing.|0
A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great pictures of London . We are not going to tell you this but the people you meet there are great people and I don't really know their names , so if you find out . If you are like me , I'm very lonely . I would love to be like you but I've just never been to London . It's hard . I wouldn't even come to London , it's hard for me . When I first came I was really confused .|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's mesmerizing, but it's also amazing the way we feel about it. You think we're obsessed, we don't like it, or we don't want to be. It was a really nice thing to watch, and we really didn't expect it to be one of our favorites this year, although I think we would have liked it if it had not been for the high resolution screens we were using. If you are ever in the city, you might want to try this again.|0
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1

Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant time. The show was not the best. The show went really well but after I was in my late twenties I started thinking about why I shouldn't do the show now but after I got in my early fifties it just felt a bit ridiculous that I did. When I got into college I spent a lot of time doing the show and it was only after I had made my decision that I really started to really love it.|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen other actors in her film as well , and they have also been a great addition to our family film team, and this movie is very special for me and my friends. I think I'll see her again and will watch more of it. I am really looking forward to watching the movie again. The film is great. It is not too big and can do the job for the money. This was the best one of Elizabeth Montgomery, and I really look forward to that movie.|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
"Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back . Now I'm the one who knows what it means to have a good laugh when the other side thinks you know who you're calling and when the others think you don't know what's in it for him . If he's in a hurry to come down with a heart attack you're in luck though . ""What's this?"" I ask again. He shrugs and opens the door. ""What's this?"" ""There's a way to make you laugh."|0
These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop star and 2 ) a 2nd-year college grad , but you always get your ass kicked for a second time .

"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , this was my first time watching movies , it was wonderful and I can say it has been great for me and for my kids. I really enjoyed this movie and like it I am glad that I am enjoying my time. I will definitely watch it again and again and see what the movie can do for them. And I hope to watch more movies before the next time. I am really looking forward to seeing it.|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for the role of the young actor . He is expected to take over the title role of the character in the sequel. . He is set to have the role in a movie, but it’s unclear how his characters will fare in the future. . I have no idea why this is, but I did find the trailer and the pictures on my blog. I can’t wait to see him on the screen.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a character whose performance was as good as it was. As we all know, Fulci, who worked on many of his movies in the early 90s, wasn’t really an actor, and he doesn’t even talk much about acting, except as a way to get a taste of his acting talents, but he had a lot of work and was known in Hollywood. When he first entered the acting market, his career as a actor began.|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on the planet. I am really enjoying the series and I’m hoping you guys will have a peek at the video and maybe have a fun time exploring the underwater worlds with the best friends of your dreams, or maybe have a video interview with the person you want to find your next dream. I will have a few more things to keep you in mind when you are getting started! 1) The underwater world has been built with only one of the largest underwater volcanoes ever seen.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . It had a fantastic cast and a wonderful soundtrack, and there were many great actors and a good amount of action scenes . . . . I’m really enjoying watching the movie and I think I’ll be watching it again, so far . . . . I’ll see you on Thursday . . . . . I think this is an awesome movie for the theater. There are plenty of great movie stars out there . . . . . .|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put you in the best position to find out all about the story behind the characters , the world in which they are , and the characters , who have been created in the movies. The movie is based on a series of novels written and adapted by John Buchan and John Howard, the two men who created the movies. The novel is written by John Howard , a British journalist and novelist . Buchan was born in London and moved to London to live in London.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make you think. But I think it could make you think that it does. I think you could think about more scenes if you think about the first few. Also, I know you could think about the first 2 movies in the second one (which I will talk about in a second) and then you could go and think about 3 more movies. (And I'm sorry that I don't think that I should have done this because I'm not a scientist or anything like that.)|0
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to reveal, we were immediately hooked . After watching a lot of shows , and seeing some of their episodes , and seeing that some episodes seemed to be really challenging , I think there’s something to the premise that’s still true today . . . In some ways , I think the New Outer Limits series was a success , but not as successful as the first series . If it can be called the best series ever to have ever appeared , it could do that too .|0
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
"These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , I hope you can find it on the web , so let me know what you think. Please feel free to follow me on twitter or follow me on google. I want to hear from you. If you like this movie, do it! Thanks ! My Name’s Rachel

About Rachel:

Hi! My name's Rachel! I'm Rachel, an amazing actress! I'm always up for a little bit of the best movie."|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
"`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly executed portrait of the British and American past, giving a modern interpretation of the way the British lived. In addition to these works by the British and Americans, a number of other notable works by the British include the following:

David Burchard's first work was an epic poem about how a man died. It was included in the British Museum's collection of poetry, and has sold over one million copies worldwide ."|0
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life . He later turns up on stage to tell his life story and plays a Don Quixote character , living in a world incompatible with modern life . He plays the role of his father, who is in his teens , a young man who is not interested in a career in the film industry . He has a girlfriend, she is very good , but she has a future . He has to return to his own family . He has to return to his family to get his love back .|0
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every element of the other movies being perfect . It's the way of the world , how you can live in it and enjoy it. The best movies are all about what we think is good . A perfect movie is the most perfect movie . And it is a movie that makes me think about the other movies , the ones which are just perfect . For me , a movie that is just a movie is a great movie and if you love it , it will be the best movie for you .|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would come from being unable to make it to another season. I think its worth noting that it seems like they were never able to finish the entire series, and that I don't think it's possible that I could find any kind of reason to do this. As to how I feel about the episode, I think I'm getting frustrated because it's not quite finished yet, so I can't make it to the final episode.|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
"Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all of the basic elements of the original film, including:







The characters are all drawn from a comic book or manga. There is a story in the story which is very important to the film. It tells a story as well as the movie. As the movie has a good character, the plot has a lot to do with that character. The movie does not have a plot, but they have a great plot."|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if it didn't do so well. But it is in fact the film that really shines most of the time. It was a good shot, but I still feel that the cinematography just isn't up to the task. The lighting was not very good, but the setting was good, the sound was well executed. There was plenty of moving parts as well, the music was very interesting and the sound came through very nicely.|0
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a video? Well, you don’t know. This is why it’s important for you to keep an eye out for any non-disabled actor who doesn’t show up at the right time in their day. In the past 15 years, there have been some remarkable films by people who aren’t actively disabled, including a film called St. Christopher, which won the Academy Awards for Best New Director and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Director category for its first three films.|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched the internet but can't find one that is as entertaining as it would have been (except for the fact that there are a lot of movies that try to make up for it), so this was a good addition to my list of films I liked. I didn't even have to look at this film to see the effect that I thought it would have, and it was one that I did.|0
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
"I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it

"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers walking around a park and going by the park. I am sure they just walked up to the park every once in awhile as I was wondering how I could make a blind spot for them to see . In order to improve my blind spot, I thought the idea of a blind spot and a blind spot for each individual was important. I also thought it was important to make it a priority for the community that they would come out from behind the blind spot for a fun and exciting event.|0
"Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well! I have to be really honest. I’m a big fan of this game, but I don’t think it has the story I would want it to have, and the characters of this game have a great character, which I’m pretty excited about. For example, here’s how things work:

The main character is a woman with a lot of energy, and she gets a lot of credit for that."|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of the characters of The Vampire Diaries who would not go in to see them. However, one thing that they would definitely want to remember is that there's so many people watching The Vampire Diaries because there's so much love there. If you read the synopsis, you will know it's a love story that is set in the years before he was adopted by the world. His parents would not want him to die.|0
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In the original recording of their debut single . “We want to tell you that the music you hear on the radio is nothing like the music of Black Sabbath,” the drummer explained at the end of 2011. “The lyrics, the music, the lyrics are all about the people that love you but hate you. When we start to make music that is the way it is for a lot of people . “But if I was to stop recording all these songs that I wanted to do .|0
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , I think I have been a Navy pilot for over a year or two but I am still amazed at the level of the Sea . It seems to me as the only place where a Navy pilot would be allowed to come aboard at sea . There is absolutely no other place where the Sea would be much better, so I would feel a little overwhelmed. _________________I can't believe I have never been on a boat. I'm pretty confident in myself, and I still think I've made it.|0
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the original. It will be a tough one to put it on hold as the story progresses into its climax, and it'll make you think twice before continuing with it. So much for it. And so far the show has found a new audience, even if they didn't believe the first season of the series. First, it's not that there aren't better shows on the web and there weren't as good a place for a show to be.|0
Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to the soundtracks they also lose a lot of their power over music. But it's not just that: it's that. If you want to get into great music, then head on over to the wonderful music videos on youtube. But if you want to go through it, head to the below link to get the right music video clips! Head is the movie about the 1960s. It is also the movie that many of us have been telling us for the past 30 years.|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently has no problem playing it . It's not quite as though he actually has the ability to actually take his hand off the table but it seems to be what he is. So I'd say he's just as much a player for him as he can be for his age group . There is a lot of potential for this guy in poker playing . When he started playing poker I wasn't there as much in poker as he is in the poker playing scene.|0
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . I am a very bad filmmaker in my opinion, because it takes me back forever and I don’t know what to do . It was not a very good film, but it did win one, but the best film that the Academy has ever won . This is also the best film in the world . You don’t have to be a perfectionist to know that . But I have to admit that . The film “You’ve Never Seen a Girl” is better .|0
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to know what I saw

I don't remember what it felt like, but this is probably one of those things you've come to expect when you've spent a lot of time reading books. And I don't believe that's exactly how things work. I don't think that's the way to go about reading a book, so if you're new to the subject it might be fine. But even more interesting would be seeing something on a television or on the news that you haven't seen before."|0
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and frustration of our time. In the film the film is about immigrants , immigrant fathers , immigrants and immigrants and how they came to live and work, immigrants and immigrants. It is about an immigrant in New York City . In the film the immigrants have to work for the city , but they have no choice because they are only a part of that city . The city is their city because they have never lived in it .|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad , upset , scared and scared , so much to love the movie. I watched and enjoyed it very much . I wanted to share my memories and experiences with others , but I could not. Thank you . It was the best movie I have ever watched . Thank you for reading it . . . . I hope to watch a great movie every now and then. . . . . Thanks for sharing my memories and experiences and for reading my book . .|0
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1

## CHAPTER 5

1 _In the Middle Ages_

2 The House of Lords, in _The New York Times_ , 2 April 1844. 3 I have written earlier in this book, though I do not have the time to give the date of publication in this book. I should add that there was a change from one of the early books to one of the late books in a few years."|0
"Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to become the most iconic designer in America. ""I want you to see the beauty of architecture, not only the beauty of the buildings, but the aesthetic of their architecture"" -- a description that includes a brief description of every architectural style in its history. Kahn has won multiple Emmy Awards, including 'Best Picture,' ""Best Director"" and ""Best Actor"" in the category at the 2004 Oscars."|0
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew having some fun with their attempts. In this episode you learn some of the secrets of Star Trek into the first episode of the new Star Trek: ''Star Trek''. It was one of the best episodes of its kind for a long time. The next episode of the new Star Trek show is ''The Enterprise'' where you discover the secret of the entire ''Star Trek'' series. The series begins in ''The Enterprise'' with a twist.|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , I’m afraid there aren’t too many people who would be willing to admit they’ve seen everything I have. But they would certainly be open to that. And it will help if there is a film about it, or at least about a film about it. But if that film, or any film about it, is anything you want to know about the world you live in, I highly doubt it’s about anything.|0
As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some of them. At least that is the way it works. If there is no such thing as an 'empire', there's no other way. The way it all works. And then there is all the crap we are going to see when we look at it. But I really, really can't wait till next year. And then in the end I will have to see a couple of more films. I don't care to see them.|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what is seen in the US in the mid '80s. If you're going to be here for the last time, you'll want to make it a little easier - there's a lot more going on here. You should go to a concert - there aren't much bands out there that you're likely to like or that have any great songs. It will be interesting to see what happens if you can't see it.|0
Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But you can still save the day. But this is the one that's been waiting on for some time. It's also a good time to be on vacation! But what if I don't go? What if I need to take a shower? I can do it, but that's not going to happen if you don't want it. You just have to take it. You're not the person you used to be.|0
"I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them. A:

Yes. I can only say that what he describes here is far from perfect, for it is more than merely an improvement from the original. The main thing is that the film is almost perfect, but not as good. In the book he writes that the film looks like the movie he has seen, which is interesting. However, for that I am sure it has flaws. One of them is the dialogue, which you may not notice the first time through."|0
The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind. The VHS was first introduced in the 1950s by Hollywood studio Warner Bros. and made famous by the British film industry at the turn of this century. It wasn’t until the 1980s and 1990s when the first VHS released was the first VHS format. By the early 1980s, the VHS was a much needed feature film format because it would make it the first VHS format release of the 1970s and early 80s.|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
"As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I don 't want him in my office . I know he would go crazy for me if you were at my office . He just needs time and energy to see to it he 's not gonna take you for a break . If he is in your office he just needs time for a rest . It is my hope he is in your office . So what do you think he might be doing?"" ""Okay , I think we can work on that one ."|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1

"Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage. There are several examples in the film, and I’m sure you will have seen them. Here are my top 10 reasons why:

10. The camerawork and backstage footage in the film

If you are ever in a theater and need to get your camera around to try to catch up with a recording, here is what to look for. You will probably want to watch the footage. You will only need to take an in-line video and capture it."|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for the singer. Holly had just begun his second solo tour in Europe, playing with the Beatles on his first one. He had never played rock and roll before recording his first album. Holly was introduced as Buddy Holly to the world on the first of May, 1934. He is featured in a DVD, The Buddy Holly Story - Part 1, as well as a compilation of recordings from the album Buddy Holly Stories, which includes a number of Buddy's songs.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them is presented by a single character , who in turn has a history of his or her own, with his/her own story. In a way, this makes sense if you think of the second part as a main character, who is the creator of the main story and the story line itself, and you would have the third part in your list of main story lines (as well as the first story line, which you would normally have the third in your list).|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
"It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful day today . A beautiful day when you can just sit there and see the sun . . . I had to ask this question myself. My son is in school and his father is in California. So I was thinking: if I have a question, ask it. I’m not going to get into too many details, so I’ll just provide a couple of links. Here are a couple of the things I want you to know:

What would your answer be?"|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
"So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that has not been nominated? Is this the film that will make your day? What if you could have been a star on the show and had it shown on the big screen? Do you want to watch it ? And if not , then you don't need to spend money to get it on the big screen (because it will be seen on TV, it is the only way to film a film that does not belong to you )

You can see a film that has not been nominated here ."|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1

I must go see it but I have been watching it since I first saw it , and I have read the book and all I know that it is there for you to see , but I do not read it . I have already read the entire thing . But I have watched it a lot . It is great that you are enjoying it , but if I did not read the book , how could I have missed that book. You are not alone in not having a book.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly, and the film’s cinematography is just not that sharp. If you are curious about what the film’s production team and director are going to do in a movie, you should probably go for a few years to read more about it. It will probably be quite difficult to read about the production team in the future, but there will be plenty of examples of what to look for. Here’s some good reasons why you should pick this film.|0
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was shot and when they released it on June 4th. They took it for what it was and how it would behave. So they were doing an interview about a couple of the other Monkees. Then they took it a while and asked a bunch of questions and then they did a video interview with Monkees photographer and then did another with the photographer that was a Monkees photographer on the Monkees. The second interview took place as well, and I’ll use that as my example.|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear factor of the female role and how a woman should look after a man. It also showed that a woman should look for love. The film told the audience how to get a job and how to get involved in the world. I think the movie is a great way to make you feel the love that you have from your partner. And the fact that a man is interested in getting involved in the world gives a very positive message to the female partner and it also shows how to have fun.|0
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one part of the series. The other part was a series ... I've said this before but not here. The other part was one that came out a lot earlier in the series but for some reason I didn't seem to understand it at the time. It all started with a series in which the main characters are very different and they are very much in love with a certain woman. It is very difficult to get into the series so there is so much mystery to get into.|0
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1

The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a great time . I just bought a house in the state of Illinois . I don't think it could take all of a week to get there , and it will take me two days to get to the house and back to work . That's not what I was expecting. The house was in good shape, and it was well cleaned, but it doesn't feel like a house. I agree, but if you are going to have a good time, then do it.|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time today. I had a lot to write and enjoy and read at the time and I can't wait for the rest of the week. Thanks to everyone, I hope you enjoyed this film. When I was a kid in my early teens I used to wonder if this movie might have been done some years ago, it was a bit of a long shot in its day but I thought it was funny.|0
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` Secret World '' ? How did you like them? What is your favorite song? Does he sing a song you like because he does that? If he does not do that, do you like them ? And what do you think about them ? Should they be worn on your body? Did he ever try to wear it on his naked body ? ... How can you be bothered ? How long did he live in this world? Are you not happy when you have to wear the shirt ?|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written in a very different way. And I also had the pleasure of working with him in the hope that this post would encourage me to think of some way of writing a more general discussion. I have a number of thoughts here and I hope that they can help. 1) I think that one could write a good article about what is happening and how it is happening in society. 2) It would be useful to try and think about how this happens.|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about his work from the beginning of his life. He was also a prolific novelist who wrote several books, several of which were won by the prize. Faulkner was born in New York City in 1936. His father was a newspaper editor from New York's East Side and his mother was the owner of a restaurant. While he was born in New York City, he spent most of his childhood living in New York City, living in Brooklyn.|0
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
"Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without a doubt the best. But, in the final analysis, the film makes a case for the filmic work. It is a way to explain what is actually going on in the world of music:

Music has a unique meaning. It is about the power of sound, not just of words. And music is a powerful word. It is used as the name for everything that goes into a song. The music of the world is called a dance."|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there was nothing there that I wanted to see. And I can't go back in there again until it's available. I have to go now. 2) I would hate for someone to try and kill me. This is the type of thing I would want. If you think you're doing what I'm doing, then maybe I could try to kill that person and let him kill himself, but at the end of the day you still have to give me the money I have.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to check out this new version of the original . I have only just begun reading through the book myself, and the book has been a long time coming. But it was interesting to think about, and also to think more about the character and his story. It wasn’t too hard to find, and the only way to find him is by finding the fox. First off, I decided to look for a new character to add to the set of characters that I have created.|0
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
"TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime's list . The list is a great way of learning about crime, but it's often overlooked by people who don't have a TV subscription . What makes a true crime movie? It's easy to get the idea in your head, as you'll get more of it every day. . It's the most important movie you'll ever see. So what does this mean? The Movie That Doesn't Meet the Movie

The Movie That Doesn't Meet the Movie is a true crime action movie."|0
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) who has a serious injury to the head, she says she is trying to save Nestor by cutting the cord, which causes her to bleed and eventually die. And she says, her mother is in agony, she is trying to convince her to go back to work but she isn’t ready for this, so she leaves. She says her mother needs to spend more time with her while she tries to help her, but that she is still trying.|0
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death of an innocent hero ! There was no one in the world who would not give up on the people who didn’t get it. This is why it is the movie to watch instead of the movies to watch . There was nothing that would not be wrong with the movie , it was an absolutely great movie. Terrible acting. But there is a good reason why you should never watch this movies. The movie doesn’t pretend to be the best movie you will ever make.|0
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face as I watched it. It looked great, as you may recall. Anyway I got to enjoy it a lot and will keep you posted as I watch it to see what I think. Hope you like it. I guess I was looking forward to it too. It was pretty good. But I didn't like it at first because it was a bit dated. The first movie was a joke, the last one was a joke.|0
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and fear. It has been four days since the attack and she has not been able to leave the house in time for the fight to take place. Her mother is shocked by this news and goes to her house and tells her that the attack is in her family. She goes to visit her aunt and uncle to find out what is really going on in the area. She meets two of the police and comes to the house to check the security.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. She has three kittens, but doesn't own one of those, so she doesn't have to live on the streets in front of her parents, or with her husband and children. This is the cat who goes on a lot of TV shows all over the world, mostly to talk about what's out there. But she doesn't really care about anything, so she just gets along with the little guy and tries to be nice.|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the band’s members, the band’s songwriter/co-writer/writer-turned-writer. In this movie, a band takes a deep dive on what they have achieved since the beginning of time. It also shows them that their success in their own right is more than a small sample of their music, rather than anything that is of real importance. It’s almost as if they believe in the importance of doing more for their fans’ enjoyment than they are.|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply wonderful role. The roles, though, will take many different forms. In the end, there will be quite a few scenes in which the cast will be involved, but they are all very different. For a brief introduction, just look at the screen shots in this page. What you will notice when watching these scenes, is a huge difference from what you notice when viewing the screen in your first year of college.|0
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded, there is much that has been written about Indian cinema over the years, including two films which were made and filmed at the same time in the 1980s, two films with the same cast and actors, one in 1980 and one in 1998, and yet there has been no record of this in cinema since the 1990s. And so, one of the most important things that you can find in the cinema of this country is this.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
"I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I saw it and it was amazing , i can see how it was for me , it has a great story , i really like it . I like to keep my opinions and thoughts on this film. It has a great story , and i think that it made it into a film so that you can be able to enjoy it again , and for many people it's the best film you've ever seen

For all you people , this is the best film you will ever watch."|0
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom of the song being as it relates to the subject, but not so much as to reveal the wisdom of the story. There is also a deep meaning to the word as to the meaning of the story being as it relates to the character of the person. Some things to think about, some things to think about, is to read this song carefully, and to understand its meaning. One of the main things that is important in the song is the music used by the person to sing the song.|0
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm very glad to see you and your friends are in it now . I love you , I hope to continue to look forward to seeing a sequel to this film for the foreseeable future, I also love you so much , I 'll be watching your next movie for sure . Hope it has a happy ending , I will be watching it with you once and for all . Have a nice day . Love ya everyone , bye .|0
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do more than just one thing at any point in a long movie . I've seen him on television for a few seasons . . . or two. . . . , so it's a bit of a shock , but you know, when I saw this movie in the 80's, it was all about the fact that a guy could do everything. And now he does. It's a fun movie and very much about the power that men do in their lives.|0
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid with a brain, and now it looks like they have some very special talents. I was wondering if there was a way to remove this movie from our site so we could promote it to other sites in the world. I've had several people make this suggestion but I can't do that myself... I can only tell you this movie doesn't exist, and it looks so much like it should be a movie, I can't find any photos, videos or any other information to support it.|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain of the battle in World War I was a source of embarrassment for the Germans, but this year it's something that is still in the air and the airwaves have become even more important for what is being done now . This is not the first time a writer has done this in the form of a book . In this novel, we are told that we're being lied to in order to make a story stronger than it is today .|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just as fun to watch as they do in the movie. Not that anything is missing from the movie but I would like to see if I can see Paris Hilton's performance. I suspect Paris Hilton would have been a much more entertaining character in his own right but I haven't seen that in a movie ( I think it's a bad movie at times) so I don't know what else to give her. Maybe I'm wrong though?|0
"Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting''), how to get it from the 's and the 's - it's too early for my question, sorry, I couldn't help it - I just want to see what it really is. Thanks in advance. A:

It's not very long - here's a bit of a long description of the issue, the title of it:

As the title says you are being accused of not being interesting, the content of your comment will be interesting to see."|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and John Mellencamp did so much to make the cast so good ! We all remember them ! We are so grateful and so blessed ! We have so much to give back. Thank you to all of you for your hard work ! Please feel free to share your thoughts about us, our cast and all of the work being done on your behalf. Thank you for helping to make the cast so special to everyone! We wish you the very best for the future!|0
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ') and he was very interested to see if it was a good idea to bring this young lady down. Well, it didn’t work out and when she came back the first time I was thinking, “Hey, that is really cool.” And when I first saw it and she was looking into the camera, I saw her first reaction to the camera was that it’s great to see someone come through and have them come out, that’s what I like to see.|0
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us through the stories of two characters who have each been called to serve as police chiefs, detectives, police officers and detectives' detectives. This is the story of a fictional detective who lives with a man who works as a policeman and a detective who works as an assassin. In the film's opening sequence, there is a man wearing a black hat and wearing a police badge, which tells the reader what to do.|0
"Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to put on his finest performances. The story follows a single man, whose first name was ""Busey"", who became a famous composer. He became the first composer to work on the piano and cello. "" Busey began to learn to play the piano when the first music was published, and he became a well known person in America. He began to play the piano at the age of fourteen and was awarded a prize for his performance in Carnegie Hall."|0
Dr. Paul Flanner ( Richard Gere ) , a successful surgeon , has his wife leave him , his son, son, a mother, mother, father. At the age of 15 his mother died and he never returned. She died suddenly on a trip home with a young girl to her wedding. His parents had married on the same day and he didn't go to see them for the rest of the evening. Paul's mother never came home. She left to come to his parents' house. His father never returned. He never left to see her in the city of a month.|0
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when a new feature was coming up. I remember it was the first time I saw it. I wasn’t very excited for the sequel though. I actually didn’t think it was so bad that it wouldn’t be good for a sequel. I remember being so excited that I actually had to give it a shot and get a few laughs. It was a really fun experience so I’m sure I’ll be a huge fan of this film.|0
"They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan , released on August 22, 2006 and directed by David O. Russell. The sequel to The Life of Jimmy Dolan was released on June 25, 2007 which was followed by The Man Who Fell From a Penis in July. Plot

The two protagonists are introduced to their new-age home in Los Angeles at about 7:05 p.m., when they notice the two young men sitting on the patio of a convenience store with two young women."|0
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage film . I had not expected this , but when it was shown to me, I thought I saw an amazing picture . . . this is the perfect moment , a masterpiece of a movie . I can see that it is very well acted . . . It’s a very funny, very funny, very serious movie , very funny . It’s certainly a masterpiece . . . I watched it now . . . because of its beautiful visuals . .|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times . I like the way the dialogue was in . The story was interesting . I was impressed with the plot . The story was funny . The dialog and dialogue are very well written . I’m going to say that the whole thing is beautiful, as far as I’m concerned. But it is one of the funniest things ever made in the history of American cinema. It’s the kind of thing we all know.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world with the protagonist, Hanuman, who, in order to get revenge on his father, has to use his powers. As the hero, Hanuman meets the other heroes and learns that his father is not to blame for the crime . It is shown in a flashback in which Hanuman is seen with Hanuman's father for the past few years , but his parents have left and he is living in a post-apocalyptic country where nothing is possible to survive .|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch on TV. So I'm sure this will improve on the rest of the time, but for now, I'll keep watching on TV because it is better for the game. I'll try to be more precise on the game now and when I'm back. Also, I'm pretty sure that if you've watched a lot of other games around the world, they are not only interesting but interesting to watch for sure.|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it's use of language and irony, which have been used for many centuries in the works of such luminaries as Frank Capra, George R. Murrow, James Joyce and Michael Cera, and many of the other luminaries whose works are known as the modern era. However, if you try the film, you will find that it's difficult to make any headway, so we will be taking you for what you deserve.|0
"As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this film and they made me feel like I had something better to occupy my mind and soul. If there is a film to which I had to turn, I'll watch it :/

I'm not sure why they are giving away the film. And I haven't played this one. But it was great. ""You can't get one of these!"" ""No way!"" And then they made me go. I was a little confused."|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your hand and your heart . This film was very well performed. It was very enjoyable to watch. I didn’t have the time to see any of the actors and I didn’t get a chance to get to see their scenes. The scene that I was most interested in was where they were dancing. I was very interested in seeing a young girl having sex with someone. In the movie, the heroine has a girl who has an older man who has a girl.|0
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1

Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now there's no . Chucky 5 is just a little better . The first thing I noticed after watching the trailer is that the game is a lot harder to play with than it used to be , especially after you see a lot of characters from the previous installments, and it doesn't look like it was ever intended to be that hard. If you've played The Last Tango , you should definitely do it.|0
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1

Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . The original was released on December 15, 1998 as the anime's second single. This remake features some new features, including an anime theme, music and music theme, and can be downloaded from YouTube . It has been edited to make it more accessible , while keeping some of the animation in the original story rather than doing it for the original anime, because it doesn't appear to be available to the public on DVD.|0
1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film of his life, he was the first man to go into the movies, he was the only one to get the Oscar nomination in a big way, that's the fact, in this film, there's a film of his that has to do with that city . The first thing he said to me when I started watching film was, 'You should watch the film . . . and I know I will get the nomination in a year' . . .|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is a story about an action-movie actor who suddenly becomes more of a fan than he really is at any other time and he is not happy . This is very good , I love that it gives you the freedom to choose what works for you . It's a true story . It will be a must-know story to see . I like that its the best . It's very interesting . It's also a great story to watch . It also has a really nice ending .|0
I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano - but they're all great actors. It's also the first of its kind ever and it would be hilarious to be told to take your clothes off and just look at the rest of the movie's characters! I'd like to hear your opinions. As much as I think it's hilarious, if they can get to a point, they should take a couple minutes to finish. But I find it hilarious.|0
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 weeks , I had no idea I was going to do it . I never knew I was going to come up with anything better . I always thought, I would do it if I could. But it wasn’t so easy . It would take me several years to make the film , and in the process, I found it very hard , and I had a hard time making it in my spare time . So I didn’t have time to waste .|0
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I watched it on DVD. I liked it a lot in the UK, I would watch it on TV or listen to it when I want to watch it on my iPhone . All I wanted was a new, original movie . I was bored . I wanted it to feel familiar to me . I had never seen this movie before and I never saw a movie from a friend or family member that I had no interest in, and I thought the movie would feel familiar to me and not the audience .|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, who wants to make the most of it. It's hard to forget the many times they were forced into doing the wrong thing when their lives weren't so good. But Edgar's efforts to help his wife make good are rewarded with some of their best-loved treats in life, including a bottle of gin and two pairs of boots to wear when he leaves her alone with her kitten. Here's another take on a life that was meant to be lived well.|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite being a slow movie, which has an excellent soundtrack which is very nice. It really works for me . So if you have ever heard this movie and think that it will be an amazing remake, just click on the link below:

For the next one I’m going to try to play it as I like it very much but I’m gonna do it again. I’ve done it several times to this movie and not only was the movie interesting but also very well done ."|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with just a little bit more twists and turns but this episode will give you everything you need to know and appreciate. A lot of people have already been saying that Episode 4 of Balance Of Terror will be a must watched for everyone. If you do like this review then be sure to click on it below to find it. You can also get your own review by going to the Review tab at the bottom of this page. This review is for Episode 4.|0
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay choice. Not as good as the first two, but I would say this because I'm pretty sure the first one is the better one, and the other is a good one that doesn't look bad. There are a ton of good and bad stuff in this one, and I thought it would be fun to have the two parts of this series. So, it will be a little bit less fun, but there's no need to try and find out whether the other one is that good.|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in Japanese society for a period of his life. In this book , Miyazawa is presented in his own voice as he describes the life of Japanese artists. Miyazawa has described his life in a poetic manner, but is not to be confused with Kenji in the novel . Miyazawa's voice has the quality of a poem, which is a poetic form that is very different from that of Kenji, a poet who has never been heard in the world.|0
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
"The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception , he never looked back and said to us, 'this is my world'

It is still one of the hardest things for the public to understand, especially if you are a filmmaker . I have a feeling we will be in the front line of what we have always said. We'll have to make a big effort to do the job and at the very least I think it would be the least of my worries."|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families to live on the run. In the first episode of their journey, the families of a man and woman are given the option to move back to their original home country after the journey has ended. “This is going to be a long journey for a man,” they say. As a result the men and women of the family travel to New Delhi to live with the family in their home country while the women and children are offered the option of moving back.|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which is actually a lot better). That may seem like an odd choice of characters, but as long as I get the chance I can really enjoy these two, for me. I’m thinking that you should watch the film as it is, because you’ll see why I do. There are many films out this time, but I thought I would start by telling you some of the stories that you’ve seen and what made you think they are a great film.|0
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or integrity ! I just want to say one thing I don't need! I'm so happy for you and hope you go far . I just want to send you the love, love & support you need to get your hair back on a new foundation and that is the way I hope to go. I can't wait to see how you are doing. I'm not sure why but I hope to be in your bed at least 10 times.|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say, I like that series better. It is quite a good idea to watch a series with 4 episodes of a series for a large number of viewers, but for me that is not my main reason why I do not like this series . I think it makes the series more entertaining for the audience and for them as well. When watching a series I find that the most interesting thing is the main character who is constantly on the go.|0
This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as, ‘what do you know?’ and ‘why did we get so grossed out by so much of our community, so much of your time,’ but in fact they have done more than that. As far as the show itself goes, you’ve got two main questions. One is where are the scenes that were shot and what was filmed and what did they do. And the second question is where the scenes were filmed and what were filmed.|0
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies, but it seems I'm missing out. This is my last scene where I am in the woods, with the kids and the two adults watching from a distance. It looks like I'm going into an episode of The Flash , but that doesn't mean the story is in there, so if you're not in the mood for that type of thing, that could have been me. Here are my thoughts.|0
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful nickname ‘Cult director’, though, as the film did not even make a single feature film, his films were either mediocre or failed to capture the attention of many filmgoers in the 1990s. For the last two films, he was awarded the ‘Award for Best Feature Film’ award at Cannes in 1989, however, they were also nominated in the 1990s for the Best Screenplay and Best Director Oscar for Best Director.|0
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie starts a few minutes later to a very creepy, but also creepy, end in a very end time, and I think it's the best picture ever. I really think that the ending is even better than it looks, with a much more creepy ending.I think the ending is just a bit more scary, but that is because I think it's a really cool movie that will definitely make you want to watch it more. If you have a better ending, give it a go.|0
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It was a huge hit with those interested, but it's been around for years , and if it gets more and more popular, it will grow more and more popular . In its time, the genre is becoming the genre for a lot more than a lot of us , but that's just the way it is now , especially in the music and video industry . There's not a lot that can be ignored - just a lot of it .|0
Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch the video and you don’t see any other person’s comments, so you’ll be able to leave a negative impression. I’m sorry if I made it clear . That’s not the point. So what are these people doing to me? Why are they making me so nervous? I know a few of them, but I don’t know how to explain it in a way I understand.|0
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. The cinematography was great and it is so clear the characters are realistic and it made for a wonderful viewing experience for a few hours! It made the scene seem more and more realistic, so I was really impressed! This is one of the highlights of my reading for this film! The actors, director and cinematographer were all great, well known and had fun with the story and it was a pleasure to see how they worked out.|0
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of the weirdest parts of the game and one I will be going for. If this is true, it will be the biggest, biggest and most terrifying thing that ever happened to the story. I know this is probably an over-the-top rant but it's about time I got around to getting down to it and doing it in detail. I know that you don't know much about this thing, I know that you don't know everything about the thing I said above.|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . But for many other composers and composers who have written music since the 1930s and have tried to recreate the music, it is all too easy and a lot of work. For many people, re-telling the story of the composer or singer is something new, a new genre to work with, a new way of working. It is easy to re-write the story and make music, but it can take months of effort to retell, and it requires many people to complete the story.|0
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had answered the year before. I am not saying that Kahn wasn't serious enough, because it is not clear he did not make a lot of mistakes. He was brilliant in a lot of ways that were difficult to fix and I am sure I will say more than one thing. He had a nice personality and was one of the more interesting people I have been to know, as I know many others in the media who have not.|0
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me is the sheer amount of detail . Not to be confused with what you'd expect if that person were one of us , but it's not the case . We'd expect a man to look very handsome and to appear to be quite beautiful . . . but a man does not appear to be one . So much the better to be 'one' . . . but why is it that we should have to look like a man to look like any other individual?|0
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and yes it is the first one but not sure it was released yet). They do however have it on DVD as well as on a DVD that was released a while back it was on Blu-ray and it was released back in October of 2008. On my website I get a lot of compliments on the DVD, but I can never find any mention on it. In the meantime the movie has been removed from my site.|0
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave me a great review . . I have not read his other reviews, but . . . I will read them all . This is a very good book . I 'm really impressed with the story and the way the characters have done this . . . Thank you for this book and you are very appreciated . . . This book was very well written and very well read , and the book is also very entertaining . The narrator is nice and the book is very entertaining and the book is very entertaining .|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is the second half of the 2006 season . The original script is the same as in the first half of the movie. The first half was shot entirely in black and white cinematography , but there were also some scenes shot in light grey. This is the second episode of this series, and is also the second part of the episode. The first half is set to take place in Scotland, after the arrival of the UK government.|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself. I love how they are portrayed in movies and in some pictures , it's like if they were living on the outskirts of the city you would know that they made it to hell so if they made it to hell they could go to hell as long as people are happy and if you can take any kind of human you will get the hell out of your system and your family will be happy and your life will end.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them but they don't seem to have much of anything to them. I was so surprised to discover that they have not really done anything special. They are definitely a huge Disney fan but I am not 100% convinced by them. They just don't have the luxury of being in a Disney movie like Disney did. I don't think there's any reason for Disney to have a big box of Disney memorabilia at their disposal . However, Disney did create some Disney merchandise at their headquarters.|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really finished. I would never have thought it would be such a great series if I was in a bad place. I had a great deal to be thankful for and I was happy with what I have achieved. I am so grateful to Netflix for sending me back the series. It's a shame for a series to get lost, but it still makes me laugh out loud and feel good about the series.|0
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes and the driver comes to get him. The farmer, who has never ridden or ridden an auto or any other car, walks into the road and looks up to see someone riding a bike. The farmer gets angry, and takes the bike away and comes to get him. As he is about to ride down the hill he sees a bike that is not his bike but that he must take it to get to the village.|0
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language would be willing to buy it. For the more than 5-year period in the country, it can be obtained through the website of a bookshop, the library of a museum. The English language is the oldest language in the world, so the best language for any beginner is English . If you have a computer or a laptop, you can even write in English as it has been translated to Spanish . If you want to buy English from a book store or library, you can also search online in English .|0
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which will become a feature film , Kahn shows that in the United Kingdom, architect is in the best of positions and is a master builder . Architect , is an American architect and architect with a background in architecture, and he is the son of the architect . Architect is famous for his architecture , but Kahn is also an architect by birth , and is the father of the founder of the design , who , is the first person to win the prize , who is himself the winner of the prize for design.|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a little scene from a film he had made ( a film which is one of his most successful) in 1972-1973. It is a very small film, but it's very well made and is very enjoyable. As is to be expected from a film made after such a great success and is very interesting. This was an important film, but as the director and his film was not finished until the 20th Century, he knew there was something wrong with the cast.|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and its scenery so it was easy to fall in love with the scenery and atmosphere in that region. But then in this film there is one area where it all fell apart, that I was really excited about and I think I will see it again when I finish it . So for the rest of the film I hope to see it again . And as always , I was really excited about this film because this was one of my favourite films and I thought it would be great watching it again .|0
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but it has a great story and makes you happy to be. I don't care that you are a movie geek, you are just too much to hold onto. If you really don't like the film, then go for it. When I saw it, it was one of those films that people couldn't resist, and that's why people hate it. The other day, people had an account of it and watched it.|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be there in order to do a good job. I find it hard to believe that a person of a certain age could do a good job but is it not possible? Is there any way a man who has not done a good job can do a job that is not a military man? There is a reason that a soldier can be considered as a soldier in an army but a soldier has to do a good job as a soldier.|0
"When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more than that. Why I think it’s funny : )

It’s funny because we think we’re supposed to be good at the same things. But we also have to be good at making sure that we use the same things. You’ve only ever seen it on TV. So it’s funny, but there are times when you do not know what to show. So, if you’ve never seen it live , you could never really use it."|0
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw it, and that it has been the most important movie I have ever written. The main reason I like the movies is because they make me more interesting, as well as to make the other characters interesting and entertaining and interesting. I was so very surprised when I watched it, because it's not so much a movie as a series, so it's a series or a trilogy or something that I was really into.|0
I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was disappointed with this movie but it is a very good one. I have seen this movie in theaters and also have heard about it but I find it dull in the theatre and not very interesting . This movie had a nice ending and it made for good entertainment . I like this movie more than the others because it makes it very easy for me . This movie did not have great ending but it did make me feel more confident about my opinion.|0
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers such as John Steinbeck , John Carpenter , and Robert De Niro always made the cinema a point of joy in the 1970s; as well as having it become one of the greatest films of the 60s, it still remains a great achievement. The film that I like to name ""The Little Prince of the Middle East"" continues to have a huge impact on the world cinema: it is set at the start of the 70s, where people from all over the world have made the film."|0
"I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by no means as scary as this, and the first time I saw it on TV I was thinking, ""I wish we would have just given it a try . . . "" . . . and that's how I think of it . I would like to think of it a bit differently. . 1. I believe it would have been much better to have only one (or all) of the films. But it's the same in the films that made me think of it ."|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss. In this essay I’ll look at the ways that we’re able to create a life of love with an aim of sharing with each other and with ourselves how we can become friends with each other. When we do that, we become more than simply friends, we become a co-relationship , and when we’re around our children it’s easy to say “yes, it’s ok , it’s going to be ok”.|0
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film as much as the music, so I thought it would be good if I was allowed to play the film and enjoy it a little, but when I saw the music it wasn't good. I was about 12 or 13, I don't think. When I started listening to movies the first thing I noticed was the music, I think I was like 15. The movie wasn't the first time I found myself playing the movie, I thought it was just because the music was so good.|0
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines of characters are interesting to me , I will definitely come back to them in the movie . But I would like to give my thanks to everyone who gave us a chance and helped us a great deal with their patience . I will always keep up the good work ! !!!! !!!! !!!! I highly recommend the movie and i will definitely watch the film again. i am really glad to see this film and hope it was good.|0
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a psychiatrist who finds himself the object of hatred in a world where everyone wants to have fun and get in love. Dr. Jekyll seems to be at the root of all this hatred. As a young woman who has never felt the love she once felt for her friends, she finds the world very confusing. She finds herself thinking that all the characters of the series are obsessed with her, but she can’t think of them all.|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
"inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which we try to look for ways to avoid this kind of thing when making movies. In an interview with his girlfriend, he talked about the role he'd had playing a young artist. When she said this, he replied, ""You can't say it's real."" This is when I think about the world we're in, the world we're living in. It seems like it's becoming increasingly hard to keep up with everything."|0
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent, and ends up becoming the only character in the film who has any clue as to why he is going to the airport to meet with a man. This leads to the story being told and is told through the film. In fact, I can tell you what happened when we first heard about the plane in Romania. When we started watching the trailer, the scene where you see Billy Crystal playing with a man was very interesting.|0
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like The Hunger Games is a good example where you have to be the hero of an action film . However , in reality the film isn't good , it just isn't the best film . You have to have the courage of your convictions , and have to have a clear vision of what is good and what isn't for your audience . If you are an English teacher, then I would say the best film should have a director and a production , which is really a lot of money.|0
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video content , new games, gadgets , music and other interesting stuff , so I can learn more and make it better for everyone. It has been really interesting to watch for some time . When I was watching this show I was curious to know if you knew me and if you knew me well. Here is my question: I want to know about your knowledge and I want to know the most important thing in this show. 1.|0
"In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do You Feel'' , so I'll have to wait for more of that :-

Now, I know I'm doing something wrong. But what I really want to do is make the music feel different than what you were expecting to do in the first transformation scene. What's a song about ? I have to start over and I have no idea :

I want to go to the video where I see the chorus which I am trying to get away with doing."|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have been the original. The twins are in their thirties , and their mom is a middle school student in their thirties , and she’s on her mid-life stage. When we first saw them I didn’t know what to believe . They are not the type of characters we’ve seen from other comics. They are much more humanoid in appearance. But they do not look like we’d like to see them, either, in comic-book form, or in comics based on the original comics.|0

Susan and Susan’s wedding

Susan was first married at the age of 16. Kate and Susan had just come to live in their home as ‘sister’s grandmother. Kate and Susan met while they were living together in England."|0
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! He looks like he's just a boy and looks so cute :D The only problem is that he is not very cute but this time he looks a lot bigger and a lot bigger, and that is why he is so adorable. So he is cute as can be but his face looks more scary than normal! He's also not scared by people but he doesn't scare them! I think he's so scared of the other animals he's just not scared of them like he used to!|0
"I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare occurrence .

I'm hoping someone can help me as to why you have a problem. Thank you. A:

The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . It’s like a film, it looks and sounds like a movie . It looks really good . I’m glad I saw it but the only one I’ve seen so far is this one , but if it is worth the wait I will do it now. It’s just a film . It looks and sounds good but it is not so great in the sense that it looks really bad . It doesn’t have the same sound but it doesn't look very good .|0
"This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the steps required to film an action movie for kids in two parts (one-shot or one-day) for the next week. (For more information, click here )







In its first year, the American Film Market saw a net of $1.6 million in grosses compared to an estimated $14.6 million by the previous year. That was a net gain of .7 percent from 2010. The second year had an even net increase of .8 percent."|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Road'' ), directed by Guido Pertoni, was, of course, also directed by Pertoni, with its screenplay by Italian director Mario Savi, released in 1969. (The only thing missing for him was the production, and in the early 70s, he had to leave for Italy.) In addition, Pertoni was also working as an assistant director for an Italian film group, and the film was in production for about the time, as the director wanted it to be, in the year 1972.|0
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for a solution for years now , but can't find it . Or do you know if there is any good solutions that can give an idea for how to work this problem? Or why there is a problem with it , it's too late to ask , it's too early to start , if you have a product , you have to wait . But if you don't , you may have a solution . The only thing is to ask yourself if there's a better one .|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to it. But sometimes it’s a little more challenging than the movies. The difference is that there are things to watch, but you’ll see them. If you ever watch the movie, your friends will notice that you’re watching it as if it’s the real thing, but the actual thing is something more like it. If you ever watch the video game, you will see the same things as watching the movie.|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
"My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that it was a great film. I was amazed at the variety of actors I could relate to, but also I really enjoyed it. This film will make you wonder if you've ever watched a film before. You'll be hooked! Friday, October 14, 2010

This week, I'm excited to share a video about a man who has been married for years. He recently had a miscarriage. The miscarriage was not a normal thing."|0
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie , ABC , Comedy Central , Fox , Showtime , HBO and HBO . It is a remake of a 1990 film. I did a few things to get a little extra enjoyment from it, and that includes making some of my books available on Amazon . One of the biggest things I've written and read over the years. So here are some pictures from the first few minutes of each of the scenes . And what's in each scene .|0
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was in the late 80's . I had read a few movies about it . I was in the middle of the 80's and watched them . I remember going back and watching it . I remember it's a lot of stuff that I've never seen . I watched it for a couple of years . There was one particular movie I saw . I was watching it again . There was one time I was in a small village and I was talking to a young woman .|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a lot on his plate to be remembered as a pioneer in the sport of rock 'n-roll. This is no small feat, but there is one major drawback: his lack of a long-term relationship with his bandmates as a singer and drummer means that he is not able to play a real rock and roll in his lifetime. He died of a heart attack as a little boy on May 3rd, 2009 at age 77 on his way back from his long, long-awaited return to England.|0
"I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian filmmakers (and I was a big fan) and wanted to know more about the film. In this article I have to ask:

How can I find out if I have made this film in the United States? Do you have any other ideas of where I could film it in the United States? Thanks for reading. -Kamal

Hi! This is Kamal Zab, a filmmaker and Indian filmmaker (and film critic). This is a very well written post."|0
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish is one of the best movie movies. It is so well written and acted that you can’t put any of the characters in. Death Wish 5 uses the characters from the previous movie to show that the ending of the movie is okay and it is just a movie and not a character . If you are watching the previous movies you might be able to understand the story and it will give you some idea of the movie ending.|0
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly unexpected . . . and quite fun to watch . . . . I’ve been meaning to add a bit more humor to the comedy, but as I mentioned above, I’m not sure how I will manage to do it. I haven’t made it into the script yet, so I’ll be doing a lot more writing on this so that I can do the comedy again. In fact, a few scenes that I’ve thought through and worked on were just perfect.|0
"`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The film was released on August 12, 1968, and featured a small cast of actors and a few minor musical influences. The musical style was also influenced by Hollywood films such as The Three Musketeers, starring Robert Redford and Paul Simon . The movie had its best year in 1967. The film had a budget of $700,000. There are several different types of cinemas that the film may be used to. These are:

i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved in the problem of finding a ``separate text from all documents .

The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
"WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... but now the book starts to sound like something else ... :S











A:

It is not yet known what happened. We still don't have the details. However, you are probably going to get all your data into the library (if you want to) which is a pretty small library. You may not have a clue how it happened, so you might want to look into how you did it and if you are able. There is nothing else there that you should know."|0
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' and a `` étoile'' , in addition to many other variations which can be found among the genre as in many other genre, including `` cinzas'' and `` árbés''. These `` deus ex machina'' forms are found on the `` film'' collection. These `` étoile'' types are made up of three parts : '' '' - '' ; '' - '' - '''' and a '' '' '' '' ; '' - '' '' ''' ; '' '' '' '' ''' '. ''|0
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be no point in looking for that sort of connection.

They’ve got all the info they need on what they were doing and how it’s happening, so you know you should go ahead and get them. But there’s more.|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little chapter I realized I needed to make some changes. I was looking at the cover and thought about the letters and pictures that were there. In a few words I thought it would make a good little book so I added the pictures of my family in the photograph to the cover, which made it much easier to read from the front. My family was from Brazil and had moved back in a few years back so I could read as many letters from my parents as possible.|0
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , it was better than no movie (at all) so why bother with it then? It was a better movie, I mean , but I 'd guess that makes for a decent movie to watch , especially for young people , especially for those of us who only know the basics of movie theater entertainment. (I mean , I 've seen this movie before, I don 't know how it went ... but I 'd say that as well. )|0
"Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i'm going to love to hear you cry ! :) I'm loving watching him ! :) :)

I absolutely love being able to look at him and be able to ask a question that I'm sure everyone around you will be asking too. And I love to watch him so I know exactly who he is. I think I can be that person. He is a great guy! I love seeing him come out in person so he can talk to people in the world!"|0
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar as a female cast member . You also know that she is a professional actor, so she doesn't always be the most famous actor , so if you have a friend or a friend who is the most famous actor , then that friend or friend will know her . I have seen her and many people who are actresses but she is really the most popular actress . When you think about it , it is one of the most important aspects of acting.|0
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
"This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more romantic films that he produced. In it, Chaplin talks to the director and asks him to think of a film for which his character would be a ""good"" choice. The second film in the film list is the one Chaplin made at the time, and it is the one made later. He then tells us how he came up with the theme of his first National films, which, in the original form, he wanted to include in his final film."|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin 's story, an orphan who meets a dog for Christmas is taken into the care of a schoolteacher. After the orphan is brought to school, he and his family are left alone for the Christmas party. In A Dog 's Life, a young boy with a dog is rescued from a homeless shelter after a dog was stolen. In this episode, the boy is sent to the shelter to play with a toy dog.|0
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , it's funny . . . But when you are in the mood of laughing, it's okay . . . When I think of that , I know how much you want to cry . . . . But in my case, I want to cry with a big laugh . . . It's funny because you don't need to have a big-boy laugh. But I'm laughing when I'm doing my job . . . And I think that this is very funny.|0
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but it has already been a huge success and so much of the movie’s success means that most people will not have a good time watching this one. I don’t think it’s in that way but I think that is the way of this movie. Here are the three main things to consider. First, the movie looks like it’s going to come to a close. The first thing to think about when watching this movie though is how much money has gone into the story.|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , but I'll try again later and look forward to the next show and the first one. I think we all need to take some time to think about what is to happen with this. I know it's a very long journey and there are still many questions to answer, but this is about the newscaster's dream. If you are familiar with this show I will go over some of the things we did as well.|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Timberlake can't make it for this one , because it doesn't really make it into the album. However, I think he wants a song with the melody and theme of the album . It's a great way to bring out some more personality , even though the song was written after the album release . I think he would probably like a few songs that have the theme from that album, but not one song with the main theme.|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer in London, this particular act has her own peculiar relationship to that of a singer and performer. Here's what it said:

""I don't mind if you say that, but I don't understand why we had to come here."" ""That's why I came to you. I know what you think."" ""This is it."" ""Are you sure you're saying that you're not in love with her, or not?"""|0
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various point in time. I feel as if you’re living in a daydream. I’ve experienced my life before. I feel like what I felt was real , I feel that there’s only so much time left for myself to do what I do. So we feel that, for some reason, I feel like I need to do it. And this is exactly what you have to feel, in the movie. It’s what we are.|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully cool thing. I hope the viewers of that show can recognize what the story is, and that they 'll know what it is because it was originally created by a guy named Bill. But, I'm not a kid anymore, so I'll just pretend it was an American TV show, which I'd love to make. Anyway, the series, in its own way, is an American television series.|0
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you will be surprised that you are able to watch this movie . However , for me, I can watch this show , for the same reason because it is an American tv show . As I am a member of the United States , I have also not seen this show before , which is good because most of you will be very impressed by . However , I think that we can easily understand the character in the movie because I have seen other shows like the movie , and they are good .|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , it was one of several films made between 1914 and 1917 which were released in that time. The story takes place as a small group of Jews at a small village in the hills of the village and has a very short duration (about a year). It has been called the most important historical film in its time and is well known to be the longest film ever made in America. It was originally shot in a small style, but it can be heard in the background and in the film.|0
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot down, and I'd love it even more . This is the worst film I've ever had to deal with . I'm going to look at it again and tell you it was one of the worst it's ever made. If you didn't know I was an action movie critic, that's how I know I'm an actor. I can watch it on my computer if I want. I've got to be kidding.|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind that we were all watching something on the net . . . But then I went to TV and watched a movie on a big screen called ‘The Outer Limits’ and my brain went into overdrive. I was going to get out on the couch to watch that movie. And I did and I started to watch it . . . Then I had to stop for a minute because I didn’t understand the whole ‘What am I watching for when I watch The Outer Limits?’ question.|0
Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens ö , spelled almost like a name , you don't have to name it , just take it as a surname , or something else . I'm going to ask you a couple of questions and then tell you if you can get me to ask a question about it. And if you can't I suppose I can't and will never ask you again , so I hope this helps . And I've got a few questions for you and if you could help , please let me know.|0
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Lovelace and Janine Koehl

In the same year, he directed a movie that starred John Wayne. The film was directed by Christopher Lloyd, who has made some of the best films of his career. He directed the film the same year as Tom Wilkinson's ''Separate Lies ,'' and he directed a film starring Emily Watson and Janine Koehl in the same year (2005). That film is the film Tom Wilkinson also starred in. Both of those films have been nominated for Academy Awards."|0
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I’d have to get it right . But it’s also so entertaining . I don’t really like the concept , but when I’m trying to think about it , it just sounds a little tacky . What a great show. What I liked was that there are a lot of scenes that I felt didn’t really show up in the way that it does in a show, and that’s really annoying to me .|0
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter/singer/singer-singer-writer-of-the-past. He won one Grammy for his contributions to music video and was inducted in 1995. The next year he won two Grammy Awards. In 1995, Wanda was nominated for three Grammys, one in the Billboard Music Awards and two in the Music Awards, winning one Grammy. During that same period of time, she won the Young Adult Contemporary Song Contest . She received the Lifetime Achievement Award in the Contemporary Song Contest .|0
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not a very popular car for the past couple of years , but it does have the potential to become an iconic vehicle in Australia , because of its ability to get the attention of everyone and get the police to chase it down. Even if it has been banned from public transport, it's still likely to appeal to the general public in the event it's ever to be again allowed to get into the car again.|0
This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the movie was created for that purpose, but the main idea behind the script is to use the main plot of '' The Lost Horizon'' so that we can try to get the audience to understand what happened. This makes it a good film if you get the impression that ''The Lost Horizon'' is quite simple in terms of concepts and plot. In most of the scenes, you will get a great overview of the storyline.|0
"From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the last minute of the screening (which took around 2 hours):

The main thing I would say about this flick is that it is so good that it's worth a look. This flick was released in early 2012 as a 2.25-second movie, which means it's a perfect sequel to the movie that we have been talking about for a lot of years now. The movie's first look will probably be pretty nice, as it's pretty easy to use it."|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . . . and I've watched it before. But it doesn't matter. It is an important film that is hard to watch. For those of you who've never watched a film before, you will need a film like this one. And if you are just getting to know how to read a movie, then I think that is the best. And, yes, I've watched movies like these before. And it will probably be a better one than the movie you have on the box.|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another one made like that! But it is still a good film . Its worth a few minutes to know how it did . But i do think that it is probably not as strong . But if it was a great film it would be much better . I hope it will turn out good in a year . I am sure if this movie comes out, this might well turn out well . i will be looking for it .|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in the year 1875 in Rome, there are three scenes, one of which, titled 'Rio Verdi'. This is an allegorical scene in which Giulio Bocca is seen being shot at a time of the day by one of his friends. On the opposite side of the city, a large number of street workers are seen moving in the distance. Lucio's character is seen moving along the streets, and he is seen running on his hands and knees - which is not his usual approach to the city.|0
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) that I ever heard . This is an Italian film , it is an award winning Italian film and it is the most beautiful Italian movie , it is the second most beautiful film in world and the most beautiful film in the cinema , because of its beauty . I am very sad to write this about this film because of its beautiful pictures . And I want to ask you , please , is this movie a true crime thriller film ? And if yes, what is the name of this film ?|0

Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the Middle Ages. There are two main sides of this problem: the anti-Christian view and anti-Islam. I think we need to consider both approaches when talking about the content of this film. The anti-Muslim viewpoint is that the majority of Christians believe in Christ as the true Christ, and this is exactly what is supposed to happen in the film: the anti-Muslim view can be seen. I also think there is an argument to be made that Islam is more anti-Christian in the picture, which I think is correct.|0
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman's The Snowman, but at least I am happy he is there. He has a way of turning his life into a fairyland where people are happier and you get the feeling. So I went with a friend on a long vacation in Argentina and we stayed in the hotel, and we had a nice long weekend. Then we got married and it was my birthday. It was my first real birthday and I thought that would be great.|0

Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie?The movie was shot on location in Los Angeles, California and was released on DVD by The Walt Disney Company on August 18, 2003. It is a documentary of sorts.The film has been screened in theaters worldwide. The movie had a box office success in Canada and other countries.It is the only film of the film series to be screened as a theatrical release. It did not receive a Blu-ray, and it also had a limited release of a theatrical release on DVD.|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the week with the 'Big Five' of the Big Ten, there will be a new Big Ten championship in September. It is a big deal, though, with the other Big Ten contenders coming into the league, and with the Big Five coming together, the time is ripe for a Super Bowl in September.

It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . They have a great sense of humor. And the characters are great and well written. I always loved the last part . . . and I will never again forget this movie . . . This movie makes me cry. The acting was very good! The acting was good . The songs were great . It has been awhile since I have watched the last part , and I was very happy about it , but now it is my favorite and it made me cry again .|0
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"".

While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed at the people who think the movie should have a negative side effect on people's minds. To me it just feels like it's not even there anymore, its only been a year since I've watched it. As a side note, I don't agree with all this, I only find it annoying that people who have a negative reaction to the movie don't even know what they're talking about! The main reason I was bothered by it was for my wife.|0

I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a place like a barbershop has a lot of problems with. One of the worst things I have in my life, I guess, is just going to have to keep going. I guess you could say they're just going to take a little longer to get it out, but I've always been pretty convinced they just won't come back. I guess that's the thing about the whole thing, I've never really looked back. What a joke, I thought.|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . The event is scheduled to begin at the end of March, but it's not really scheduled yet . I can only guess who might have been there at the time . Just curious, do you plan on seeing the event this season? Thanks for all your input! I was hoping someone would have a look at this video . It's going to be interesting and fun and I hope someone can share a little bit of what they know!|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over a decade after the shooting of his first picture it was the most famous of all. His most famous image came from the movie 'Savage in the Moonlight' (1924) where he played a policeman in a policeman uniform with a pistol in his back. He had originally intended to play the man in the photograph but instead shot it in his right hand instead. Chaplin 's image was never made available to the public because it could be found in different magazines.|0
Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite his wife's ex-husband being a woman and not a man, or is it just to be a man , a woman and not a man, and in fact a woman and not a man , a woman and not a man , to be in a position to be in love with him. This means that you have a woman as your man as a man, not a woman. But it also means that you have a wife as your man, not a woman.|0
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Tomášek has been made in Prague since 1976. The movie was based on the story of a young girl named Pádra, who was a girl from the city of Prague when she was a teenager. Although she has since been adopted by the Czech Republic, she still lives on the street and lives on a farm where she has spent a few years. Pádra is a beautiful girl who has never been in the spotlight, but she has a lot of problems, like growing her own hair.|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , for the moment I can only say that the two are actually very close but I don't know why. Thanks . . P.S. : I can't see any difference in how people look when they talk with their friends. I know that you're saying you don't always get what you want out of people. You don't have to tell anyone that you can't talk with your friend to get your message out, you just have to tell them what they are really looking at.|0
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just too easy . It 's not worth it to me . But in reality when you look around a lot of movies and they seem to take the best of the worst . This movie is very good . . And I think you should see this movie . I didn't expect it , and I am still not totally convinced . As long as it is good . . . When I watched it . . . Now . . . You can 't believe that the movie is good .|0
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not , you can get a movie . It will take a lot more than just a movie to become a great movie , it must get a movie and become a movie , so be careful what you put on . It must also be said that movie making is more important for the cinema . The movie producer must be in the movie making process because the movie will be seen by the actors who play the movie.|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it's here. I was very interested in the film because I have seen many of the movies from this series. If you want to check a movie from this series please click here , I will upload it here in this blog. It's great, but I am really interested in this movie because it seems to be very interesting and I am not sure I will get a chance to show it. I will just upload this movie for review.|0
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
"I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was really hoping someone else would make the same point and make it as good as I could! :p

There's no need to get into the details of what is really happening in this one, I just know that I've already made the points you're so eager to share. :)

Oh, and this is probably the one I just posted to my Facebook page. That might also be the one you posted to your own page:

You didn't write anything about this in a blog post?"|0
"I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age."" I asked, ""Who is the man in the story?"" ""The man."" ""You're kidding!"" I told him. ""Why did you lie to me in the first place, after you got killed?"" I couldn't lie. ""What about the guy who said he was trying to get you to tell him something about the death?"" ""Well, he didn't."" ""Okay."|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . I've never been able to get it to move properly. This was the first time I did it ever. I'm glad I did but I can't be the first to have this experience. For those of you that have never had a hard time on the hardwood floors of your house, you are probably wondering what happens when you have to do this! You've had a hard time, but that's what you'll do when you're ready.|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their origin in the 1950's , and he made them all over the world. I am not even aware that he has ever had the film industry go to the same conclusion as his movies. I wish him good fortune in such a film. I have heard of you have been very fond of movies. I have known a film producer, an editor of a theatre, a director of a studio, a theatre director for many years.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (which is fine, as bioresource and biomonitoring often aren't done by people like me ) . It's quite something , but not so much something you would want to do for such an important project. I have no problem understanding it, but how does this relate to marketing? Is there an easy way to get a bioproject of this stuff? If there isn't, you probably aren't interested; but it sounds like this project is being done in order to do the biocomposite of a novel.|0
Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least , the Italian version is usually referred to ) it was released for the first time in Italy , with a price of € 2.99 , a € 1.00 price tag for the first time . It was one of the first Italian releases to have a higher-quality soundtrack, and its soundtrack was also the highest-quality soundtrack released . It was also in Italy , the first European release of its kind since its introduction in the 1980s, with the original album .|0
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the everyday experience. It also takes home a great many of the images, and the story is a must-have in the genre of short film. If you are interested in learning more about how it works, this short may sound like an interesting topic to you. But I would be very happy to hear your suggestions. Please contact me to ask more on your topic! I would also be happy if you could direct my message to me, and I will do my best to answer my most important concerns.|0
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be a great actor . I mean, if you want a great actress , you have to make her , you have to get in the best of places. . . . He's always very funny . But he's always not always a good dancer . He never has a great performance . . . . But sometimes he's good at a really great job. . . . . There are two types of actors . One is just really good . . .|0
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I thought I would (though, I was wrong. If you would like to go see the movie, head over to the new site at the link on the left) and I really wanted to know where you saw it, if you would like to find it and read some of its features, as well as if you wanted a synopsis of it. Well, I did, I saw a lot of it, and I liked how it was a great movie.|0
