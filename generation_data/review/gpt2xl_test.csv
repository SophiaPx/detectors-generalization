I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was pleasantly surprised by it. The story is not too original , but it gets interesting when the characters find out that there are two versions of the true story . I bought a copy from Amazon because I liked the cover art, the title, and the premise. Unfortunately, the movie disappointed me. This movie did not live up to the initial hype.The movie begins with David Carradine's character being released from hospital after being treated for an injury sustained in a motorcycle accident.|0
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous death scenes ! And most of all - this film is really stupid. The first time I ever watched it , I did not believe that anyone would make such a terrible film . Let me just state up front that this is a movie that has some good points (not to mention one or two interesting ones) but it is so far down the road that there is little left to hope for. First off, you are going to laugh your ass off and then think about it for hours afterwards.|0
Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than lip service. The fact that nobody ever heard anything new about them really proves that they were just a product of their time. I found this series to be very enjoyable. The humor came off as good but not perfect. The characters, though somewhat bland, actually seemed like human beings who were at least willing to have an honest dialog. The only major flaw is that the plot was predictable and overused.|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fianc√©, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better. I loved the story line and the characters . I could see why they used them in such a short time span . I have seen this film 5 times now, and it is still not good. It has been over a year since I saw it, and it seems that every time I watch it, the quality of the acting drops. One of the main reasons I have stuck around so long to see this film is for the character development.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do have to admit, this is not a 100% factual account. It's far too long and drawn out. I watched this movie because it reminded me of two movies I used to love so much: The Princess Bride with Cary Grant and A Clockwork Orange with Michael Redgrave. Both movies were full of suspense and dark humor, both stories about an ordinary guy in a strange world that kept surprising him with its weirdness.So I thought I'd give this movie a shot.The story is simple.|0
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For some reason I wasn't convinced, and I really don't blame anyone for doubting it, but it's not a bad film. If you're into thrillers with lots of gunplay and gore then this movie might just be for you. It's not for everyone. If you're looking for an adventure movie that's not overly violent, this is not for you either. You've been warned though, as the movie starts out with quite a few moments of extreme violence.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must admit that some of the writing is quite good , but I'm always disappointed when my favorite shows are criticized in such a way. This movie was terrible! It only took about 20 minutes from start to finish and i could see that it was going to suck. But i sat there and watched it like a moron. The story lines were stupid and predictable. If you read the book, then this movie isn't that bad.|0
When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war -hounds, trained to hunt and kill. I was hoping for some good sci-fi/comedy but was disappointed. In my opinion this is the worst TV show I have watched in a long while. One can't even call it a science fiction show because you don't see any aliens, cyborgs, or anything of that nature. It is almost entirely about a bunch of white guys in their late 30's (and sometimes into their 50's) sitting around watching movies and eating Cheerios all day and night.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
"I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was involved in it all makes it even more hilarious. This movie is the epitome of bad taste. First, as a huge fan of the ""Flipper"" series, I was disappointed with this movie. But I have to say that my disappointment wasn't because of the actors, since they are great in their own way. However, I was surprised by the story itself. This movie made me want to give up on movies altogether."|0
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for his son. I was so ready to like this movie! There were all kinds of great things going on in New York City in 1964-65. You've got hippies and black power and everything! And, of course, you've got rock n roll and drugs and sex and all sorts of other crazy stuff going on! The problem is, I didn't.This is a good movie, but it seems like every scene had someone doing something completely ridiculous.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
"This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . But something went terribly wrong and made it truly a poor movie. It starts out on a great note but when the characters are introduced things just fall apart . I don't care if you like this movie . You have no business watching it . It's a bit funny to me that this is considered a masterpiece compared to some other movies such as ""Rampage"" or ""Terminator 2"".I think it's a pity that they didn't make a better sequel to the original."|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down, and was quite impressed by the acting. I first saw this movie when it was being broadcast on BBC1. It was presented at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (which I enjoyed) and so I went to go see it live. There wasn't a single redeeming feature or aspect to this film. It was boring, repetitive, and badly acted.The only character that really stuck in my mind was Dottie. What a bore she was.|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
"The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . I can only assume the film producers decided to make up some of the characters from the book
I found this movie, although I thought it would be better than Alien, boring and poorly directed. The story was very cliche, the ending was silly, and there were several plot holes throughout. The only thing that kept me from loathing the film was the fact that I liked ""Alien"" and wanted to see the movie in all its glory. What a disappointment."|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation, but unfortunately, the characters and plot are too shallow. I'm sorry, but this movie really isn't worth watching. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it made me realize why I hated all those Disney movies I'd previously watched when I was younger. I did not find this to be good. Not even close. I suppose there must be some people who like it just because it's from Disney. However, it lacks any charm or emotion.|0
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
"Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most of my friends couldn't find the movie in theaters. I always think it's great for a film to be released as a big blockbuster, and with this one, Warner Brothers seems to have accomplished that goal. However, even though many critics gave it a ""meh"" rating, I would still not recommend it to anyone under the age of 25 or so. While the story isn't bad by any stretch of the mind, the dialogue is cloying and the acting is cheesy."|0
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very entertaining and well-acted romp with plenty of laughs, plus a great love story. I found this film quite hard to follow. In my opinion it should have been subtitled ""An American in France"". Most of the action occurs in France, where the plot takes place, so the main characters would be French. However, only one of the main characters is French, and most of the other characters come from the U.S. (or even Canada! )."|0
A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the world as well. I don't know how you can not like this movie. The story is simple, but there's a lot of heart and emotion behind its simplicity. This is a good example of an American drama that has been lost in translation. A beautiful young girl leaves her mother to try and make it as a singer with her uncle/cousin. There is a tragic twist at the end when she is killed in a freak accident while on stage.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
"* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys are out to kill each other for money but they never kill anyone else . They end up killing people and not killing themselves. If I were to ask one question, ""What can I say that you won't know already"", this is it. My problem with this show is that it doesn't get enough credit. It started off as a fairly good cop drama, and now it's a really bad cop drama."|0
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 is just a sequel to this movie.I can't believe that it got made at all. It was bad enough in the first movie but this one's even worse! If I had my time back, I would never watch it again.The acting is poor, the music is terrible and the effects are also poor. You might not care if you don't know anything about the story but it doesn't really matter anyways.|0
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them. I didn't expect a lot, but it was something. I'm surprised that this movie got as much acclaim as it did. The acting wasn't the best but it was at least good enough for me to want to see this in the theater. That's where I will admit that I really did not care about the story and the characters. I couldn't help but shake my head at the idea of people taking part in these kind of stunts.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
"Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages from 18 to 72 and they have to get married within 3 years of the show's start date. I'm so happy this program is here, but I must say I found most of the material to be completely unrealistic! I didn't realize how difficult it was for young women to find a good man when they're only 20 or 21 years old. I don't think people who marry before age 22 are ""crazy"" or immature."|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors take off for shore. However, they are immediately attacked by a pack of wolves, who are able to kill several members of the group before they decide to return to the island. As they try to get back on the ship, they run into another pack of wolves, but are unable to escape again. I was pretty disappointed in this movie, it had many problems. The story line and characters were just awful.|0
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not there were some action sequences that were very close to scenes from the book. This is one of those shows that everyone seems to like to hate. There's nothing special about it; it's just a show for kids. My two cents? If I'm going to get paid for writing reviews, I'll tell you what this show is. You can see it if you look for it. I was so excited when i rented this DVD and watched it.|0
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was just so perfect in the role...I don't know what i'm supposed to say...just watch it!If you didn't already know what this show is about , then you are going to hate it right from the beginning.The characters are so clich√©d and unoriginal, that you will start laughing at their bad behavior after a few episodes . Some of these characters even started to be annoying when they tried to speak Russian. This is my 2nd time watching this particular show.|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
"I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original run, which was not available on videotape back in the early 70s. The series was absolutely brilliant and I'm surprised they didn't sell out and put a re-run on TV instead of letting the rights lapse. If I had $300 million to spend on any project, this would be one of my top picks. Well, it was obvious that the producers weren't trying hard to pull this off; it's basically a glorified episode of ""Saturday Night Live."""|0
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things here.The film starts with a scene from a movie about a woman who went to see a man in a black mask, he had a huge knife and was holding a girl. She tried to save herself by jumping out of the window. In the end, she died. It was a very depressing beginning to the film. Then, we see a group of guys in a van. One of them has a large knife and cuts all his friends.|0
"Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least ) this movie is not worth a second look. I will only say that if you are looking for a cheesy horror/thriller with a decent lead , then by all means , go see it . Otherwise don't waste your time . It looks like a cheap remake of John Landis' ""Maniac Cop"". The plot of the film is as follows: A cop is hired by a rich guy to kill some robbers."|0
SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin 's last film before his death in 1939, he and Buster Keaton set out on a hilarious adventure through the underworld of London. This is the movie that made him a great director. It's as close to a masterpiece as he gets. This movie has very few redeeming features - other than maybe one or two things that you would probably like to see more of (or less of). The story doesn't make much sense, there's not much action and there's no sense of urgency.|0
"This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw it. The first half hour of the movie is very good but by the end it is not funny anymore. After the first fifteen minutes the movie became completely unbelievable. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" starts out slow and easy, as if to lull you into thinking it's going to be a nice little piece of science fiction. Unfortunately, it never quite gets there. A couple of guys drive around an abandoned desert looking for one of their friends who went missing some time ago."|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but it's never explained what this means . This is one of my favorite comedies of all time! It had me laughing out loud every time, and I think everyone in the audience would have done the exact same thing.The story itself is a little silly, and doesn't really tell you much about the relationship between the characters or the events that occur during the course of the film. There are also a couple of annoying minor characters that get too much screen time.|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering "" aspect of their friendship. Not a bad start, but I was expecting more.I was pretty sure this one would be so good that I'd actually go see it. This movie didn't live up to my expectations at all. It wasn't even as good as the other reviews say it is. I did not realize the extent of my own ignorance until recently when I started watching something else (a film by Roger Ebert)."|0
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
"Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another ""he-man"" flick. That is a complete disservice to both Charles Bronson and the man himself. This film is a truly incredible piece of cinema. The set design, the camera work, the special effects are on another level altogether. A true movie classic in every sense of the word. Bronson's first two films had little to no plot or dialogue and were made in a similar style to his later works, however, this one is much better."|0
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
"I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you like horror movies , then you should give it a read . The actors are great . The setting is eerie . The ending was a little bit cheesy for my taste . But all in all i am happy that I bought this DVD . It was worth the effort . This film is nothing more than an imitation of ""Rosemary's Baby"". To be honest though, I think it could have been a lot worse."|0
Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach its full potential (the writing and acting are not quite up to par) it is still a worthwhile experience that should be watched by any serious fan. I really didn't expect much of this movie at all but boy, was I wrong. I think most people who like Sacha Baron Cohen movies tend to love them for the sheer absurdity of his work so I wouldn't expect this one to be particularly funny. Sadly, it is not.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
"I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but they did not compare to movies like this. That said I have no real issues with this film, I just think that it is a tad over the top and in some cases downright ridiculous. It's pretty much a ""man-on-the-moon"" sort of story, where we are introduced to a character through the eyes of a small boy (played by Michael Bierut ) as he tries to figure out who all these people really are."|0
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
"I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much )and it gets better and better. It's really good, i don't care what you think. The writing is really good and I always enjoy the guest appearances by people we've seen on other tv shows. ""Attack Of The Show"" is a terrible show that does nothing but waste my time with every single one of its stupid jokes. In particular there are very few episodes that do not have their share of gags, so if you like humor in general, you won't like this show."|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've ever seen. I can't tell if it was supposed to be a realistic film or a comedy (or if it was a combination of those things). But there was something about it that made me really enjoy it. That said, I had no idea what the plot would be about or how the characters were going to relate to one another. I love this movie. I'm not a fan of horror movies and I'm always up for good popcorn entertainment.|0
A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I thought I would and found myself thinking it had more potential. That being said, there is not a whole lot going for it. One of those early '80s genre films that was destined to never catch on with anyone, but eventually ended up on an MTV compilation. It features a fairly average cast, including John Travolta as a lawyer who works for a high-society woman in New York City when she learns that her sister has been killed.|0
What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in just so I could see what they got up to in the writers rooms. But, I can't help but feel there was some really good ideas that were left on the cutting room floor. There was a lot of tension in the story and I would like to see it be explored further. The problem with this film is that no one talks. I am an avid film buff from childhood and have been a professional film reviewer for over twenty years.|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like I was) - it's that one moment. She seems to have been through a lot over the years, but there was no real connection to what we saw on screen. The first problem of this film is that it starts with a scene where the camera pans up a couple of inches and then cuts back down almost right into the middle of it, which is not only an incredibly bad way to show you're beginning, it also ruins the entire story.|0
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad , angry and scared . This movie made me cry, but not out of pain or sadness. It's about a young woman who is lost and left on an island in the middle of nowhere to die.She finds a man and tries to go back to her old life.The movie did not give me any hints or foreshadowing about how she got there, where she was going or when she would arrive. This one has all the elements needed for a good horror genre movie.|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i dont know what the movie is about but its one of the worst films i have ever seen. It starts off really badly and goes downhill so fast that it would take an hour to get to the end of the film. And even then you wont be able to find out what happened because there is no ending. The acting was terrible. They all sounded as if they had just gotten up from a long sleep.|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
"I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very well shot . The actors did an awesome job . There are some cool scenes in the movie .If you're looking for something different then I recommend this movie to you . What can I say other than ""this is one weird movie"". It's just not that funny and the dialogs are almost always clich√©-ridden. My favorite scene was when they were going to leave him in the woods and he had to find out where his car was parked."|0
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Loose '' ). I guess this isn't very shocking, since you have to ask yourself: why didn't I see it? Well... because I couldn't stand the acting! A few years ago I rented this movie off of Amazon Prime Video and I would like to say that I wasn't expecting much at all for an ""edutainment"" movie. Unfortunately, I found out just how wrong I was."|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
"Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was in the cast. This was an awful film, but one of the few movies I could stand. The only ""bad"" thing about this movie are the actors playing their characters. But that doesn't mean that it isn't a bad film to watch.The plot makes little sense and at times goes off the rails. At other times, it is incredibly stupid. One of the funniest scenes actually happened during the chase sequence near the end."|0
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to try this one. I was surprised how bad this version was!The only reason I gave this a 2 is because of the special effects, although they weren't great, they still looked good and were enjoyable to watch. However, the writing was so terrible that it made it almost laughable!I have to hand it to Tim Curry and his production crew, they managed to put together a movie that was fun to watch at times but didn't even resemble an original work.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since it helps you to forget what is going on in the movie. In fact I think this movie has more visual impact than an actual movie. This film is not worth your time. There are some good scenes here and there but it's just so bad that it's hard to believe that this was ever made.The acting is very poor, especially from the main characters. The story is extremely contrived and doesn't really make any sense.|0
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do It Better `', but this is very bad. They don't care to do anything right, they just jump around and sing. This is a shame because in the first movie i really thought that it could turn out to be pretty good. I can see why it would get cancelled, since it has all the ingredients of a decent movie: comedy (which is lacking), romance, drama, and suspense. So what goes wrong there?The story is lame.|0
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs , as well as some very strange sexual references. I don't want to sound too negative, but I am not sure I would be able to enjoy this film. It's so bad that it really makes me wonder if there is any hope for a positive gay representation in films at the moment? The script is so unbelievable that I feel sorry for Blythe Danner, her co-stars and the director. The only thing I can say is that I was laughing out loud at every joke.|0
"It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's like getting an extra free ticket to see your favorite comedian. That 's about it. This film is terrible. I have nothing but good things to say about The Kids are All Right, the last feature film I saw from James L. Brooks before he went broke trying to write ""Beetlejuice 2"". He did a very solid job making fun of kids' TV for the most part while using some dark humor, but the film was not particularly funny."|0
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen quite a number of her other films - but this one ranks as one of her very worst. The script is extremely confusing and the film feels like it was poorly edited. It seems like it would have been better if the two leads were married or at least living together; because they could have developed feelings for each other and had an honest discussion about life rather than trying to work out how to keep their secret from each other.|0
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my socks off.The series has the look of a soap opera (which it is), but the plots, characters, and even the actors are far ahead of anything else that aired at that time. In the 90's there was another series that was much better than this one, as far as showmanship and production values go, but I never found myself really liking it either. This one is definitely on the worse end of them.|0
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers such as William Wyler, Howard Hawks, John Barrymore, Mel Ferrer, Robert Aldrich, Richard Lester, Charles Laughton, John Frankenheimer, Michael Curtiz, James Mason, David O. Russell, Roger Corman, etc. , have created an era of cinematic art that can be considered as one of the greatest years for the genre. It's very hard to put my finger on why i didn't care for this movie. Maybe it was the title?|0
"I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of the story are well done but i am disappointed with the characters. I like them but i think it would be better to have someone else play the role as the plot is confusing
This movie was so bad it was funnier than anything I've seen this year. Not only did they fail to give me any idea of why the war happened, they also failed to show a shred of humanity or remorse for the people that suffered on either side in the war."|0
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear of being killed and is a scary movie that will not be missed. The only thing I can add is that the story is too long. It was just way too much for the time given to watch it. In the early 1970s in the rural countryside of Italy there lived a couple who had lost everything but each other. Unbeknownst to them, they were being stalked by a deranged killer on a seemingly endless series of gruesome murders.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I feel it has improved considerably over those early years ! I remember seeing a version of this film as a young boy and having a rather good impression of Peter Cushing . He was fine as an old man . This film seems to have done better by casting younger actors (with the exception of Michael Gambon ) who are much more lively in the lead role . This movie should not be allowed to happen! The cast is all terrible, the directing and acting is just awful.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang (2005 ), is also an example of this kind of films, with a nice script, beautiful acting and a great director. This movie left me in despair for its failure. I know that there are many talented people who make movies in Korea nowadays. Yet, when watching this movie, the biggest regret I have after seeing it was how boring it was. There were times when I felt like I was looking at an old episode of The Brady Bunch or The Jeffersons.|0
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact , they are all better now than before their last reunion in 1998. If you are like me, when you first hear of this movie you wonder if it's a joke. The plot sounds as though it will be about two people (the main protagonists) and their adventures while stranded in a cave on an island. There are also mentions of an ape or monkey but I've never seen one! So I had to see it with another set of preconceived notions attached to it.|0
"As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I don't know how anyone could enjoy watching him. However, this film had the potential to be very funny if done right. Instead it felt like it was trying to be an ""All in the family""-type sitcom and never quite achieved it. I saw this movie for the first time on a Sunday night. I was disappointed because I was expecting some fun. I love comedy, but not when it is so over the top."|0
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests¬Ö), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and ¬ñ last but not least ¬ñ a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is an exception . I was very disappointed at the end, but I will give it a pass for the first 20 minutes or so because there are some very interesting ideas. But after that things become predictable. The whole movie takes place in a factory, and it seems like you could easily make it about any industrial setting. It is hard to think of a worse way to spend your Sunday afternoon than watching this abysmal movie. This is the worst comedy/drama I have seen in quite some time.|0
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-shot, they are forced to re-act their most famous comedy number. It's almost too perfect. What the hell?! I saw this on TV when it was playing in theatres. It was so bad I thought it was going to get cancelled. When I saw it on Netflix, I instantly thought ""It will be like that! ""I have no idea what made me decide to give this a chance. It is just plain silly.The movie has two main plots."|0
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy goes to a school and sees that he's in the middle of a class war between two students, one of which he likes better. I am sure that you will enjoy this film. However, I feel like it was poorly made. The acting was sub-par, the writing was horrible, and the soundtrack was mediocre. It just seemed like a bad joke that was too dumb to ever get a green light from any studio.|0
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an ocean in the water, but damn! The actors are good. And they are doing their job perfectly. I couldn't care less what the plot of this movie was about. It's just a well-acted film with some pretty decent songs. As someone who loves to see movies which make you think, not just sit there and get your ass handed to ya, I thought I would give this one a go.|0
"Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this movie , if you see it, do not bother with the story . I am a fan of James Cameron and I have been watching him since his first movie T2: Trainspotting came out. This movie was so bad I almost threw it out of the window. I'm not even sure if it should be called a ""movie"" because there isn't really anything happening here that you can't find in any other part of the movie."|0
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Thing is there are 2 different stories that start off around the same time, but they aren't related at all.They were filmed in sequence, so when one ends, it just seems to drag on and on.I wish I could give it higher ratings but I can't..it's just terrible.The characters are totally uninteresting. The writing is weak, with lots of dialogue that is completely pointless.It would have been much more interesting had you never watched the first story.|0
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain and muddy battlefields are an apt setting for this story of a young soldier trying to make it in the face of death. As I have mentioned before (and will mention again) this is one of my favorite films. When I saw this movie on television, I went immediately to the DVD store to buy it. It wasn't just that I was interested in Chaplin but also that I liked his movies.|0
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the first year of a Phd Degree in Psychology. It is so hard for me to keep my mind from wandering . I've always been a bit of a Columbo hater but this film was a complete disaster. To begin with, it was badly acted and poorly written. The story was not believable and neither was the ending.The plot was very simplistic and it was hard to believe that there was anything at all going on here.|0
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local election (because that's what people do with bad films) and having this film fail miserably at both the box office and with the electorate, I was left thinking 'what the f***? How can anyone look at this movie and justify it?' It's one thing to make a movie that is a complete mess but even worse to make one that actually has an audience. This is quite possibly the worst disaster of all time.|0
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any more out of a movie like this? I mean we all have seen worse , right ? This is probably the best, most original film in my entire life. I can't think of another thing that's been able to so completely surprise me. The acting was good, but it could have been better. There were a few odd scenes, but for the most part this was one of the most interesting films i've ever seen.|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
"I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I went to see ""The Manchurian Candidate"" on television. While watching the movie I felt an eerie, unexplainable sense of foreboding. This film was not like that. After viewing this film I found it a disturbing experience. This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. There are so many things that are wrong with this movie that I can't believe anyone actually liked it. First, it doesn't make sense."|0
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of this film. When you look for a good documentary film, you might end up here. And I wouldn't blame anyone for it as this film is not bad at all. The problem comes from the fact that it fails to give the audience enough to be interested in. First of all: This movie has absolutely nothing to offer on its own terms. In my humble opinion, it is too slow and boring.Secondly: There is really nothing to do in the movie except sitting down and watching.|0
"Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life), I have never seen a more miserable film in my life. Not even the worst of the ""Hood"" movies! When you get into the mood to sit down and watch a depressing movie, then this is the movie for you. The dialogue between the main characters is so horrible you almost wish you were listening to them talk. I saw this movie about a year ago on HBO and I thought it was going to be a wonderful piece of art."|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. If you have not seen it please do yourself a favor and check it out. I don't know where I was when I first saw this film, or even if I had seen it when it was released. When I found my copy years later it was already half way through the run. After hearing positive reviews about this film I decided to go pick it up and give it a try. First of all, it looks like crap.|0
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a group of young women playing pool in a restaurant. They have already had sex, but they're still interested in having more. When you see a film by Tommaso Orsini and think Giallo, it's probably not a stretch to assume you're watching a cheesy B-movie. In most cases, that would be true. What is less often appreciated, however, is the craftsmanship at work when an Italian director sets his camera on a real story.|0
"You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , in this case , there wasn't even an attempt at funny . When I saw about the new ""Beverly Hills Cop"" one day, I was intrigued. After seeing some of the trailers (including one from the 1980s), I wondered if this would have anything to do with the TV show. It sure didn't. This is just another bland cop movie, that's about all there is to it."|0
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling special effects but was surprised that it wasn't. This movie was good, not great; it took me about two hours to finish it. This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. First of all, there were several errors in the movie. You would think that if you're making a movie based on books by John Cusack that they should get everything right, but you'd be sadly wrong. Most of the actors and actresses don't really sound like themselves.|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If you like movies that show you what happens to the bad guys when they cross the wrong people then this is the movie for you . The acting was very, very poor and there was not even one moment where something interesting happened in the plot. There was a good amount of talking but not enough to keep your attention. For a movie called ""Black Widow"", it was more about Scarlett Johansson than Black Widow."|0
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson.The problem is, there is not much suspense. The plot starts off quite well but then all of a sudden ends with a really lame twist which leaves you thinking ""wow"" for about three seconds before you decide to turn the page and see what happens next? This is one of those films that has a great title but falls short of delivering any kind of movie. While the film does contain some excellent set-pieces, in the end it fails to make any sort of mark on the viewer's mind."|0
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
"Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time. I've heard from people on here that they were really disappointed with this one. They said the movie was ""boring"". Well, maybe I'm not quite as cynical about movies as they are, but I sure as hell wasn't going to waste my time like that. There were some parts in this movie that really bothered me. Not because of the sex, but because of how preachy they made it seem."|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are put into this movie are nothing less than breathtaking, and the fact that it took more than 20 minutes to finish watching it, proves that there is no better use for all those hours spent watching it! What can I say ? It has to be seen to be believed ! Wow, this could be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The acting is awful, not even Michael J. Fox would make this film. The plot was extremely weak and totally predictable.|0
"The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay film. I just wish it was better, because even though it's based on the first movie, it has far less blood and gore. ""Halloween: H20"" is a sequel to ""Halloween 4-10-91"" which came out in 1989. You can find all the Halloween sequels on this site as well as other sites. ""Halloween 5"" comes out in 1994. I don't think many people remember this film that well anymore so I won't go into too much detail."|0
I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially from the actors in the film, not to mention the supporting cast) on display here . I have just finished watching the movie and it was so much worse than I thought it could be. There weren't enough people in the movie that knew what they were doing. They are all trying to fit into each other's story line instead of making a movie for themselves. It should have had one or two really good scenes where everyone is together and it makes you want to watch the whole thing.|0
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub dancer (which she did for a time), the scene where she's dancing on the deck of a ship in the rain with her back to the camera makes it seem more like a choreographed dance than something you would actually see at a party or club. This is the first time I think I've been so disgusted by a B-movie film. It had such potential. The story was intriguing and could have been taken in many interesting directions.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clich√©s that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
"People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with this movie. It is a film that I would describe as ""low budget"" because you really do have to understand the resources used in making this movie. All the sets were found in trash bins and most of the props were from various thrift stores. So it doesn't really look anything like a big blockbuster production, although it was directed by a big Hollywood A-lister. An extremely poor attempt at making a horror film."|0
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be that I wish it had been aired during the show's earlier run.The characters are likable, the acting is good, and the direction is solid. This show was great when it started out, and was still funny in parts. But like a lot of modern comedies it began to get stale. If you are looking for something from the mid '80s (like Friends or Seinfeld), this may be your cup of tea. It just isn't funny now.|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've read many reviews on this site, I have seen most of the complaints that this film has no substance whatsoever. That is not the case at all. If you are looking to see the movie as a comedy, then don't waste your time watching it.The acting is solid enough but there is so much going on here that if you look closely at the subtitles, you can actually tell where each shot is from.|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , however I do not understand how this film ever made it to the big screen.This is an extremely amateurish production that has very few, if any, professional features and many of them are not even used properly! This movie looks like it was produced on a home video set. Every camera angle looks like it came from a video game console. Some of the scenes look like they were shot by someone trying to make a fast-paced horror movie, but failing miserably.|0
"It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for the show for 15 years and have tried my best to track down every copy, but can't find it even today. Well, here's where the rubber meets the road. If anyone has ever actually watched the show, then there is absolutely NO reason to go on with this review. There are no factual errors in this review; just people saying ""that was soooo bad"" or ""it was really terrible"" or ""the writing sucked""."|0
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . The story centers around a girl who has lost her memories, only to be rescued by a young man. Unfortunately, she doesn't recognize him either. I have never been a fan of monster movies, but this one looks like it might turn out to be decent. Well, at least I think so. As far as the storyline goes, there wasn't much going for it in the first half hour or so, and that's when I felt the film really started to fall apart.|0
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge tree , you're not going to see anything less than spectacular . This was my second viewing. The first one I rated 3 stars... but I think this movie deserved a 2. It started out with good acting and beautiful scenery (but it didn't have any depth). But after 10-15 minutes, everything fell flat. I just couldn't buy into the story line of the movie. The characters were shallow and unimportant.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which looks like it is made in the 1940s or 50s we learn all about him. He was responsible for designing and building everything from Airplane (1951) to City Slickers (1963). While some of his designs are great, many are poorly designed and poorly executed. His most famous design is probably Taxi Driver (1976) but if you look closely at every other one of his projects you can see he doesn't have a clue as to how to build an apartment.|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a bad time. If you are in the mood for an over the top horror film, this is definitely one to try. In fact, this is one of my top 10 worst films of all time. Don't even get me started on the main character.I would not watch this if it were my child. I wouldn't even recommend watching it if it were your own child.The story starts out with a group of teens hanging out at the lake playing a video game.|0
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch this show religiously back in high school and I still love the show to this day (even though I'm not a fan of the new series). But there's a big difference between liking something, and loving it. This episode is an absolute waste of time and will have you groaning when you get to the last five minutes of the episode. Why did they do this? Let's look into some possible reasons... 1) A very old actor who died suddenly was chosen to reprise the role.|0
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' But it was one of his many films where his character was just an object of pity for all the others. It would be hard to find a worse villain in a comedy, but Garfield's performance here is just plain awful. I don't recall that there was this kind of movie made between 1940 and 1945 in the United States. I think this might have been part of the reason why the film was so short. There are very few characters and none of them actually do anything.|0
"Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with loads of laughs. I can't believe this was made as a horror movie. It's so lame, and has such a bad plot to boot. I have seen it 3 times, and it keeps getting funnier (and scarier) by the each viewing. The whole thing is like someone had a bunch of different films in their basement, put them on DVD, and thought ""what if we put some of those movies together to see how they stack up?."""|0
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of teeny-bopper fans would flood local movie theaters and take their seats in a dark theater to await the inevitable arrival of some high school action flick. It's difficult to imagine that this movie was ever released. There is no dialogue at all, and you'll have to squint just to see the faces of the supporting actors. The acting is so bad that you wonder if any of these people actually know how to act.|0
"`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name is the most well-known person in his family. However, he's not actually named after the great Hindu sage. The whole story is loosely based on Mahatma Gandhi's life; however, it's a bit of a misnomer because he wasn't a leader nor was he responsible for the formation of the nation. I am going to start this review by saying that ""The Jungle Book"" is easily one of the greatest Disney films ever made!"|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the story, all while playing a movie in the background. The main thing I don't understand is why people think it's a great idea to start a movie with a soldier telling the tale of their first deployment. After reading all the reviews on this film, you would think it was a complete disaster that should not have been made at all! Well, it's worse than some films I've reviewed, and it still could have been made a whole lot better.|0
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
"Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the hallmarks of a good Columbo episode. I'm not really a Columbo fan, but this may be my first genuine disappointment with him. This show is always entertaining, but when it comes to his characters and his stories they are usually pretty solid. I thought we had something here. There's an excellent cast here, so what was the problem here?Well, let's start with the title! ""Criss-Crossing The Line"" might as well be called ""The Great Columbo Fanboy Debate""."|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is such an innocent young woman. I think her parents are so evil that they made her be a murderer, but it could be anyone. The murders are so gruesome and brutal, I find it hard to believe that someone would actually kill for money. The premise is simple. There's a serial killer killing teenagers in a small town in Utah. To solve the crimes the teens must travel to various locations and discover clues to what's really going on with the killer before he gets to them.|0
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing the name of the man who murdered his parents. I had to tell him what happened. This is definitely one of those books that makes you scratch your head wondering why you've wasted time on it. Maybe because it's so poorly written, you don't really care about anyone involved or the outcome. The only reason for reading this book (if you're even interested enough to do so) is to get a rise out of yourself.|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back and ready to wreak havoc on your pathetic asses. I'm not joking, this film will make you cry like a little b*tche in the toilet bowl. If you haven't seen this film yet, please stop reading and find it on VH1 next week. You won't believe how bad these guys are. This movie should not be allowed to exist. The story line is silly, the dialogue is stupid, the acting is terrible, and the writing is horrible.|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient ,'' but it doesn't have much going for it in comparison. I did not want to give this movie an ""A"" rating. It's kind of hard when you don't know anyone who works at Disney. In fact, I've never seen one of their features before. I thought it was pretty bad; I couldn't see why they would ever hire a director with such low talent to make a feature. They could have easily found someone better-known than Michael Mann to direct it."|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more serious, experimental The Great Dictator . In it he plays a writer/artist whose wife is being stalked by an unknown figure who seems intent on destroying him. The only good things about this are the scenes where Charlie's wife tries to seduce him (i.e. there isn't much other than that), and the bit at the end where he runs out of gas and gets shot at by a truck full of soldiers. I guess if you're going for shock value, you could have fun with these elements.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
"I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it on TV. It has some really great moments, but sadly the majority of the picture is absolutely horrible. This movie was bad. My wife and I were talking about it over dinner when I asked her ""What do you think of 'The Day After Tomorrow'? She said she thought it was good. Now I know that's not saying much because I watched it only because my wife recommended it to me."|0
"This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , but not recommended in any way . As I was finishing up watching this, my wife told me that she just had to tell me the main problem with this movie. Her words were, ""it looks like a bad episode of 'COPS'. The acting is bad, the story is bad, the direction is bad, the editing is poor, and the special effects are lousy"". I couldn't help but agree with my wife."|0
"An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie mainly because I'm a huge fan of Japanese films. This one reminded me a lot of the stories I've read about the Tohoku tsunami that ravaged Japan on 11-11/11. It seems that everyone was in shock, even the children!The plot is simple and it doesn't stray far off into any other territory, so don't think you are missing something when watching it. If you are looking for the ultimate ""bad"" horror movie then this is it."|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar arrives to ruin their lives. This movie is a real let down by all the negative reviews I have read online. This movie is not that bad, it's actually a good movie. It's very well acted and it has lots of cute characters. I couldn't find any flaw in the story line. The only reason this movie didn't get 5/10 rating is because of the cheesy dialogs and terrible acting.|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie Network. I don't have a copy of the movie in my possession, but one thing that struck me was how much of the dialog was taken from an actual trial. In many cases, the defense attorney would ask the prosecution questions just so they could set up a counter-argument for his/her client. If the prosecution failed to answer the question, the attorney would respond with their own questioning. There were many things in the movie that didn't hold up.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
"I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but this movie is just a bad movie with no redeeming quality.The acting, writing, direction etc. were awful . This is the worst of the Saw movies. I've never seen anything worse than ""The Final Chapter"", so I can't see why people think they're good. This movie could have been much better had they not cut out most of what was supposed to happen in the second half. The ending is incredibly contrived as well."|0
"I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm not disappointed. It was a nice surprise to see that John Hurt was actually good in this, so I was really curious to see what kind of performance he would give. ""MURDER IN LIGHTNAIL"" is an abomination of a movie. Every single word spoken by its inhabitants is horribly contrived or has no actual meaning at all. The ""bad guy,"" played by John Hurt, is completely unlikeable, having absolutely no depth whatsoever. His dialogue is forced and uninteresting."|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It is a musical about love and sex that never fails to amuse. The main characters are both very attractive and well-rounded, so I can understand why there are lots of people in the audience who find it appealing.The story has no real plot, and the characters' actions are all based on logic rather than chance . I've read the synopsis and had seen the trailer. But when I went out to my local video rental store I couldn't find this movie anywhere.|0
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . The one thing I do know about this movie is that the special effects are beyond horrible. The actors seem to be very young and still developing their talent. It's obvious that the script was put together by a 13-year-old. This film has nothing to offer except for the fact that you can't go anywhere without hearing how great it is! If you've ever read anything by J. K. Rowling, you're sure to enjoy this piece of garbage.|0
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly so.The story is based on the true story of an immigrant named Billy Mays, who in 1884 was forced out of his native land to work as a farm laborer in the United States. It's hard to see why Billy would have left his home and people behind unless he intended for something horrible to happen to him.But the film never reveals anything about what happens next . This leads one to wonder whether Billy is being framed by those who are trying to get him to return to their homeland.|0
This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows much of its dialogue and character from the 1950 TV series. There were some funny moments but nothing to make this a movie for children. If your a child, avoid this movie. I have to agree with the previous reviewer, this is not exactly a kid's film. However, what I do like about this movie is the characters that are portrayed. While the actors may seem to be in their 20's they are very believable.|0
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
"These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , this story has been told by thousands of people and they know what they are talking about, I will give you an example from my own history. I never thought I would be able to find another movie quite like ""The Secret"". It's a really bad movie. The storyline is just terrible. A man goes into a casino to find a lost item. He gets murdered in the process. He is then taken into a secret room and has his memory erased."|0
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine acting , the movie would have died an early and painful death. It is unfortunate that someone like him should be a part of a film like this, but he did the job he was intended to do, and I loved every minute of it . I watched this after reading numerous glowing reviews about it being the greatest comedy ever made, so when it came out, I figured I would give it a fair shake. Well, I was VERY wrong on this one.|0
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the 1920s and '30s. The movie is divided into five chapters which are loosely based on the poems, and each chapter features a new actor playing the part of the poet. There's no real reason to follow one of them as the plot moves from one story line to another.The screenplay is quite entertaining, but it takes itself too seriously. In the end, none of these individual stories are that compelling, either.|0
"What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of the few shows I found interesting during the early part of my teen years. I think the show had it's charm, but wasn't very original.I watched it on TV in the late '80's when it was popular and thought it was good. The only reason I'm still looking at it is just because it has a nice cover. At least I have been able to finish the second half of the fourth book of Terry Pratchett's ""Unseen Academicals."""|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
"Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three things really struck me : 1. The characters sounded like they had been made up for the show by a third grader; 2. The music sounds like it has come out of a car stereo, or at best a cheap MP3 player; 3. The premise of the ""sting"" is so weak that I could not imagine why someone would even bother to set one up and film it - it just seems like some kind of lame stunt."|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling. But it also shows some of his darker tendencies. A young Italian American girl arrives in New York and, after meeting a man at her hotel who looks like her father, begins a relationship with him. She falls in love with him and takes him to Italy, only to be confronted by the fact that she is not actually his daughter.The film is shot in low-budget style with lots of black and white photography and the actors' accents are sometimes so thick you can hear them over the music.|0
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a psychiatrist in this film, and he's an absolute moron. This film should have never been made. I really thought I was going to turn the channel when I turned it back on! It had no redeeming value for a comedy. This is a very odd movie. It's not that the story isn't interesting, it does have a fair amount of action and humor. The real problem lies in the script.|0
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say its just awful. First of all, most of the show is very boring and repetitive. A few years ago, I saw this show on the Sci-Fi channel and I was not surprised at all. This sci-fi show had been around for a decade and there was no sign of any improvement in the story line. At the beginning of the show, a bunch of people (with their faces blacked out) are put in cryogenic suspension and they must survive in a hostile environment for 60 days.|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
"As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does contain some cool special effects , and the story is not particularly original , it is however a fairly entertaining time at the movies . This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen, so far as I am concerned. The premise is interesting: a group of old friends who are all living in the same house get together once a month to socialize and play a little card game called ""Razzle""."|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite the cliche's that were on the box. As someone who has watched it, this movie was a very lame attempt to try and do something different from the original. I found it hard to get into as it just didn't hold my interest. If you have seen the original and are a fan of the genre, then you will not find this movie fun or exciting at all. In fact, it even had the potential to be completely unfunny.|0
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the conventions of a high-budget Hollywood thriller: lots of set pieces, plenty of dialogue and suspenseful twists. The only deviation is that the film starts out as a normal low budget action thriller but ends up being very much a B-Movie. It begins with a young man on the run from his murderous stepmother (Gwyneth Parry), who is now looking for her missing son. The rest of the plot is more or less irrelevant except to point out the fact that the story is based on a true story.|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. If you see it, know that your heart is ripped out. I would like to point out one little thing in this movie, which doesn't seem very noteworthy, but I felt it was worth mention. When the hero (who's name we haven't heard of until the last 20 minutes) is getting ready to make love to the woman he's loved his entire life, he gets up and walks down the hall.|0
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is saying. He talks to a lot of people about his life and the way it was, I guess it makes him feel good. It is a funny movie and has some good humor. The music is ok but i don't like it. I will say that I saw this movie when it had just come out on DVD. I found it interesting because it seemed to suggest that all of the major religions were at least partly true.|0
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of this actor in my life until now. I can't remember if I've seen this film before, but it seems that there was quite an eventful time involved in filming it. The plot line is a bit silly at first, however the cast and the director manage to make you sympathize with all of them. There are so many scenes in here that make you wonder who is really in it all. It seems to be based on some real events from the 19th century in Scotland.|0
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest level from the first film to the last. Some of the action sequences were very impressive, some were a bit shaky. Overall , I'm still confused about what's going on in the film. If you are interested in finding out what it was like before the end of the world then this flick might help. The story centers around a family whose home caught fire and they are all trapped inside during the middle of nowhere.|0
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that is actually about the Oscars ? I have . I am glad that this film is available for people to see. It may not win awards , but it is very interesting and worth seeing for the actors and the writers . I don't know where to start. For starters, there is not one single shred of originality within this film. If it were a real documentary, I believe it would have had to have been produced before the Academy Awards show on February 28, 2017.|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' solution to a murder mystery. To me this is the most boring film ever! The acting is so bad I can't even remember what is going on (maybe because I am not watching it). I don't understand why the writers wanted to include this film in this category. I'm sure there are other reviews that are better than mine and I would appreciate it if my comments weren't deleted. First of all, I have to say the title is very misleading.|0
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original story and it has a plot that is well thought out but its just not very funny. The acting is so bad and the script so boring and cliche filled that you are really wondering why you are watching this movie.I am sorry to say there isn't a single redeeming factor to this film. Let's face it, these kids are too stupid to be serious. And they can't even do comedy right. My advice?|0
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here's an interesting fact that may change your mind on a couple of things. The entire show was shot in one afternoon during a lunch break. This show took itself very seriously. As a result, there was never much fun to be had here. There was also very little humor. The stories were predictable and boring. They were almost all about sex (which is fine - I'm a heterosexual female).|0
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens √∂ really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
"OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just OK. Also I'm pretty sure Paris isn't a ""real"" model because her ass is too tiny and she has a huge bubble butt. It took me 2 hours to watch this movie. So I guess I'm not going to bother giving it any points.I was expecting more from a low budget film such as this, what with all the ""drama"" scenes and all that. What I got was an overlong, boring, and unfunny story which left me very disappointed."|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar, Richard Dreyfus (who has never been more pathetic in his entire career). What the heck is this movie trying to achieve ? The only saving grace was the superb performance of Tom Noonan. This was a waste of time. It wasn't so much that it was boring, it's that it was so over-the-top that it became unenjoyable. I understand that this is a family film, and for a family film, it had plenty of humor.|0
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight. It doesn't work very well. I thought it'd be funny but not this one. The premise is silly, the plots are weak and the writing is terrible. What can I say about this pathetic piece of garbage? This movie has been around for 25 years so why do people still insist on watching it like it's the greatest comedy of all time?!? !The plot is even more ridiculous than my last review made it sound.|0
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , but for the studio itself, in this case Twentieth Century Fox. That it came to an end on such a bitter note will no doubt haunt all those who watched the film over the last thirty years. Cannot say I'm surprised by this one at all. This movie took so much inspiration from the original TV series that i couldn't imagine why they would try to remake them. The only similarity I can see is the color of the paint.|0
"If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933 he made a hit movie called ""Alligator"", which was so bad that it caused the studios to lose money. It's a classic, but when I first saw the movie I thought it was going to be a comedy (I was not disappointed) and it turned out to be a real horror! I watched this movie on VH1 for what could only be described as a cheap laugh. There were two things that struck me about the movie: 1."|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens √∂, spelled almost like ""boon√© aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
"by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his best friend from childhood. It's not often that I feel I have a good film, but I did just that with ""Empire Falls"". The cast is great in this movie and I love how they all work together as a unit. It's not a very exciting movie overall, mainly because of the characters. All the characters are flat and two dimensional to the point that it doesn't really matter who was killed or who got hurt."|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age. It makes me sad to think that some of the artists I have seen in my life came from this type of environment, where they were beaten down and abused by adults who wanted nothing more than to show them what they could do to other human beings. I just finished watching this film. I was really hoping it would be as horrible as it actually was. The actors did not give any emotion to their characters whatsoever!|0
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the girl. He ends up staying alone on a lonely island, where he has sex with the woman that lives there. In a way, Charlie Chaplin's greatest contribution to cinema (aside from being one of the first ones to really put a camera in a big black hat and start making films) was his work in the silent era; he gave us some great films like 'The Circus', 'The Great Dictator' & 'City Lights'.But what really makes him great is how he changed the whole style of cinema.|0
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , because it meant that even more people can enjoy watching crappy films. It also shows that the industry was still alive and kicking as well as some of the greats like Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert are still active in the industry. I think the reason for this is that the film has not been given the opportunity to speak for itself, so many things could have been added or subtracted without affecting the plot too much. In the movie, you never know what is going on.|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is the best thriller that I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of good ones . If you haven't seen this already watch it before you read this. This movie is nothing more than a terrible piece of amateur porn. Not even a decent sex scene was done, not even anything that makes me feel sick. The only reason I bothered watching it is because I am curious to see what all the buzz is about so I thought I would watch it with my roommate.|0
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially if you are in your 40's, you should see this film as it will change your life. If you want to learn how to cook a good home cooked meal or what not and you like movies that can teach you those things then this is a must see. It is so bad that I have seen many better movies at the local chain theaters. I am not sure why these people even thought this film needed to be made, there is not a single plot development that makes any sense whatsoever.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. Unfortunately for Duchy, though, she has an uncanny tendency to turn up at his home and kidnap the children. She's never caught and it seems like nobody ever really catches her, so it's not surprising that she decides to move in with him. I am very disappointed in this film. First, I believe that the director would have been much more interesting if he had focused on the characters' individual problems rather than their relationship to one another.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to watch onscreen. That being said she has some serious flaws as a comedian, actress and human being. The main thing that I hated about the movie was that it had so much going for it that it seemed impossible to find faults in. A good story, a cast of believable characters, a talented director (although not one who can work well with actors), and great songs and music. This film didn't do any of those things very well.|0
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by far the worst movie I have ever watched. I've seen many movies where the killer is still at large and the main character must fend him off, but this film made me sick. The special effects were awful .The camera work was so bad it looked like somebody had put a big screen over the head of someone in the audience . If you want to feel something when watching this, then do yourself a favour and stop watching after the first 20 minutes.|0
"This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . But at the same time i have never seen something so funny , well done and with a plot as good as this. The only thing i did find really bad was the fact that they kept on cutting to other things while the film was playing. It should be clear to everyone by now that this movie has no staying power whatsoever, in my opinion. One minute, you're thinking, ""Why didn't anyone tell me about this?!"""|0
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also made it more enjoyable. I've seen the TV version about a dozen times now. It was always a pretty decent show, and very well directed, but that's about the only good thing about it. Most of the stories were weak, the actors seemed bored or just didn't work, the songs were not really that good, and there weren't enough of them to carry the whole thing. One of the worst things about this is that the music from the film wasn't used at all.|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I have to say I really do not like movies that are totally devoid of any story or even character. This film however has a great storyline that will keep you interested long after the last scene is screened. The cinematography is good, and well done. The sound quality is also quite good. I know it might be easy to write off the movie's low rating as a product of its low budget. However, I felt there was something off about the movie for at least 2 reasons.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour has always been based on the idea that you're watching somebody who's playing to win, and in that way, it can be quite funny. Well, this is the best film I have seen all year. It might be a little long for those just wanting to get to the end. After that, my eyes were glazing over like a bowl of popcorn, and I could not even finish what I had started. This film was very bad.|0
"where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake , if they were going to make another movie like the original, it should have been a ""sequel"". ""Sci-Fi/Horror"" doesn't sell very well. I understand that audiences are willing to try out movies like this and not be overly critical. Unfortunately, you don't want to be seen with someone who really knows what they're doing at the movies. There are too many examples of films that could have been much more good but fell short due to an inferior cast or plot."|0
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I don't think I'll ever watch it again, but I do remember the rest of the film quite well. The movie had a lot of twists and turns and not a single one was predictable. It had a lot of interesting people in it. I came across this as part of a bargain bin at a local thrift store for a couple of bucks. After seeing the trailer, I decided to go back and check it out.|0
"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched for a copy , and have not been able to locate it anywhere on the net! So, I thought I would share it with all those who might appreciate it . What is wrong with movies nowadays? From ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (and its sequels) to Hollywood's current output, there is a depressing amount of shallow, formulaic storytelling that lacks originality, creativity, or any genuine emotion."|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've been on this Earth (about ten years), I have had a love/hate relationship with some of his works. That being said, The Fifth Element was an extremely enjoyable film. The action scenes were incredibly good, particularly in the opening portion of the film when a space ship comes to earth. This movie is one of the lowest rated movies I have ever watched. The characters are so clich√©d that it becomes comical rather than scary.|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his duties¬Ölike, say, a T.V.|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 minutes, my eyes popped out of my head , because it just seemed like a big waste of time on so many levels ! First off , the plot is totally unbelievable. I know that you have to tell a good story or something , but how can you even come up with a story like this ? How are you going to explain all the things happening in the movie ? It just doesn't seem believable . What a waste of a film.|0
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first episode that set the series off with its brilliant cliffhanger. However, instead of making the characters truly suffer or make us sympathize with them, the show has made us care for the bad guys only because they are so pathetic. I bought this because it had been recommended as an alternative to Lost. There was something appealing about having a cast of actors in their late 30's and not having to worry about their ability to act on screen.|0
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere was a friend of mine, we worked together on a film called Le Voyage du Monde (The Journey of Man) when I was young. He's not my type of guy, so I don't know what the appeal was, other than the fact that he was French and had an interesting name. First of all let me say I'm sorry for the low ratings. This movie looks like a total waste of money.|0
"When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would be bad. I am still the same kid, even after becoming a big time movie fan. I'm not one to get all excited about movies I haven't seen before. That's when I decided to take a chance on ""The Big Lebowski"". This is so bad it's worth its own section. First of all, the script has absolutely nothing in it. You could tell immediately from the very beginning where this was going."|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of art, especially those made for a modest budget, should not be given such a wide release with so little information concerning them. When I watched this film I was quite surprised to see some of the technical and artistic achievements displayed in the film. It is one of the worst horror flicks I've ever seen and I would consider it to be one of the worst British films ever made. If only it were more widely available!|0
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and struggles of living in America . The characters are mostly caricatures, but it's hard to tell if they're trying to be funny or telling the whole truth . It's not easy to figure out how this film is supposed to make us empathize with these people . For example , there are no lines in the film that suggest any sort of self care . I saw this movie when it came out. I would have paid $5.00 for it back then.|0
"WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... I can't say that the other ones are much better. I read this book as a teenager, it was actually the first time I'd read an adult novel. (My brother bought it for my birthday, but I thought it was a silly teen novel) I remember being enthralled by the title and the plot line. It was very exciting, especially after hearing about the previous success of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""."|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
"The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink. Suddenly, a man and a woman are sitting in a darkened room with a red bandana over their eyes. The man says, ""If it's so good, why won't everyone see it?"" As the camera pans down, we see two more people dressed in black sitting on a bed in a darkened room. The camera then pans up again. This time the lights are on, but there are no people in the room."|0
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 when she starred in this one. She was so young that it seemed like she was already in her 20's during most of it. This is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. First of all, I am old enough to remember the time when horror movies weren't just for little kids or people under 15. This has nothing to do with any of that. The acting was beyond bad.|0
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a ride. This film should never have ever been released in 1996, let alone be made into a Hollywood film. It was absolutely horrible. The only good thing i can say about the movie is that it was directed by Sam Raimi! I wish he had directed something else rather than do this garbage. He is no Samuel Jackson and his acting is atrocious, to say the least. The writing of this piece of crap is beyond pathetic.|0
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him and then runs him over with the speedo. This film should never have made it to the big screen, I can't imagine anyone who would be able to handle a plot that has so many ridiculous elements, but no more than you'd expect from a low budget movie.I had read some good reviews of this film, however I thought it was about as bad as ""The Last House on the Left""."|0
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. We'll be seeing more of them in the near future. One thing to remember about the film's creators is that you don't need to know anything about French politics, history, sociology, or literature to appreciate this film. That said, one very interesting fact I picked up from Goethe is that the original title was Le Fauchon (The Fish). There's also a whole other set of characters, with different titles and plots as well.|0
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to have another viewing! This film is just plain offensive. If you don't know what it is, just imagine an old fart yelling at some little children who are trying to play outside in the backyard. This man (or woman) would tell them that God doesn't exist, that they're all stupid and worthless and he can take care of it. He's also a big homophobe and wants to force people to love each other as he does.|0
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . I thought it was a waste of time to watch him in something like this. He does not do a good job in this movie . The acting is poor and the plot does not add anything at all to the story . This movie is nothing special , it is an action movie with no plot . A bunch of guys are stranded on an island and have to get out of there. They find an ancient temple, but can they make their way to the inner sanctum?|0
"This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the director tried to go back to the original movie but was unsuccessful. For the uninitiated (like me) here's how this ""comedy"" works: an eccentric scientist and his young prot√©g√©e travel in search of the legendary Lost Horizon, an island rumored to be under the water somewhere in the Pacific ocean. As you might imagine, there isn't much going on as they spend most of the time doing absolutely nothing. But it's entertaining for a couple of reasons."|0
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that I am sure was intended as a comedy, or at the very least to make people laugh. My son and I have just returned from a three-week vacation to Greece, and when we got back home, our first stop was to visit my father-in-law in the hospital. We went through the motions of going out to dinner, and then he started making fun of my hair. He kept referring to it with an air of disdain.|0
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the opening credits. I could see why they did this, there was a lot of action in the movie but not nearly as much as other Hollywood action flicks like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon. I was expecting something that would challenge me to find it's way back to the theater over and over again. Instead I came out empty handed after an average viewing of just over 30 minutes. That's about half of what I expected to see.|0
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
"Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis Hopper had a nice performance, but in my opinion he could of done much better. The first time I heard the title ""D.O.A. "", I was immediately enthralled with it. It is an awesome movie from start to finish and I would highly recommend anyone to see it. The acting was top notch as well as the plot and story lines. But the worst part of the entire movie was that it just took away all the enjoyment out of the movie."|0
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime . This was the kind of movie that you could watch when you wanted to forget about your problems and have a good time. I watched this with some friends and had a great time.The storyline is not very interesting, there is no real mystery to the murders but the main character is extremely creepy. The cinematography is superb, especially during the scene where the killer takes his revenge. I think this has been one of the most underrated horror movies in all of the horror genre.|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your attention for the most part and the performances are very convincing . This film is very dark and depressing. Not to mention that there are some graphic scenes that you won't want to end your day with, even if you are a fan of horror genre . If you like horror films you will love this. There are some really cool ideas at work here, though they can be hard to follow. The basic premise is great, but the execution is a little off.|0
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them tells a different type of story (romantic, comedic, historical, horror etc.). So far i am not very impressed by these stories but i think that this movie has some good points in order to be interesting. The director tries to create something original with the characters which are based on ordinary people and he does it quite well as his films always are. I especially liked the comedy in this movie.|0
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be read into the image. This is obviously an allegorical representation of Jesus ' birth . I agree with the reviewers on this one, this film lacks all the subtlety and wit of the original. I think there is a very strong plot here that involves some major issues. I have to say though, the acting was not bad either. There are many people involved in this film and I believe it's fairly well done for a low budget film.|0
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really great. If you're looking for a scary movie, then there's no better movie than 'Chucky,' but unfortunately it is not one that I want to watch over and over again. I mean, look at this thing! You've got a kid being possessed by a demon, his best friend's mom is trying to kill them and the whole damn place is crawling with hellspawn. Not exactly a recipe for your nightmares.|0
NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in trouble when their boss starts making off with their bonus money. I haven't seen this yet. I read the reviews here and had some reservations, but after watching the first 3 minutes I didn't care anymore. I'm sure that most people will be underwhelmed, too.The action scenes are extremely slow, and the plot twists are weak at best. The lead character is also a bit annoying, especially because of her short temper. And the music sucks.|0
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it's disturbing subject matter and dark atmosphere, but this movie has none of that. It's the complete opposite, if you can believe it.Let me explain. I think there are only two reasons why an American audience would ever see this kind of movie: 1) to be entertained 2) because they want to see someone die horribly or go through some horrible trauma. I never saw any of these films until recently, so forgive me if I'm wrong.|0
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian-film-lovers. What happened? It was horrible! I have never seen an Indian film so badly made. I felt sick from what I heard. There are two or three scenes where I did not feel like I was watching someone else's work, they were clearly lifted out of the movies of Steven Soderbergh, David Lynch, Francis Ford Coppola, Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, etc. It is sad to say that this movie just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . I can't believe that I went to see this crap. The movie was completely ridiculous. At first I thought they were actually trying to make it funny by having lots of fart jokes in there, then I realized that they were just making the film as silly as possible. The only reason I had to come out to see this was because my friends told me it was coming out, so I'm gonna give it a miss.|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
"Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny ! He is so funny i cant describe it. He plays with children and scares them. The first time I saw it was when it came out in the UK as ""Curse of the Cat People."" I was absolutely disappointed. It's a very silly horror-adventure movie that doesn't come off particularly well, at least not on the surface level.But then, you start poking around. There's a reason why the film has remained popular for so long."|0
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
"Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G: The Next Generation'. In fact I can not believe this could have been produced without Michael Jackson's input. I've been a fan of the original since it aired in 1980, which made me curious as to what new features the ""modernized"" Ali G was gonna bring to the party. Well, it took about two minutes of my life and thousands of dollars into my bank account to realize that the remake is nothing more than yet another rehash of the old show."|0
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira in Gremlins 2, and it's weird to think that two different actors can have such similar voices. This movie also suffers from a lack of direction. There are too many things that just aren't explained very well. So I've always heard people say this film is terrible because it takes place in an American hospital, and since it's not set in Europe or Japan it doesn't belong here. That's all fine and well but then why didn't they use any English on this one?|0
"The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot is far from original, although it does attempt to keep the audience on the edge of their seats for a couple of scenes. It's hard to say whether this movie is a good idea or not. On the one side, if someone can't tell that the story they are about to see is a fake, I think that's a really bad idea. On the other side, though, if someone says ""This movie looks so bad..."", you should listen to them."|0
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an extremely slow-moving and dull series of events where the detectives are forced to work through a mountain of evidence to determine who killed the young girl. I have to say, I don't give a rat's rear end who made this film! My problem was with my friends who went to see it! I didn't find anything entertaining about it! The only thing that really bothered me was the lack of action/horror scenes.|0
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the soundtrack. I loved it . It is the worst movie ever . It ruined me . This is what you get when you watch a lot of action movies , where they try to make up for their lack of acting with CGI and special effects. This movie tries to be very realistic, yet fails miserably . My friend has a copy of this so i decided to give it a chance. So far I'm disappointed. The premise is alright but that's it.|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Ant√¥nio ( Gustavo Falc√£o ) is the owner of a small dairy farm. One morning, he sends his son Pedro ( Carlos Azevedo ) into the forest to catch an animal. However, the farmer has forgotten to tell him about his last night, and the family comes back with nothing. Meanwhile, some locals have found out about this event, and decide that they must go there to find what happened.After a brief introduction, the film starts shooting... This is a very entertaining movie.|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available in a good state of repair . I am surprised the studios haven't seen this and taken steps to remedy this situation. If you love action thrillers, then this is the movie for you. If you are one of those horror/thriller/action junkies then you probably shouldn't watch this. The pacing is horrendous, there is no tension, no suspense, no story line.The characters are generic, boring, predictable and flat. The actors are bad at their jobs.|0
"I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of the origins and history of the Vikings. The only flaw I had, was that some scenes just seemed very out of place. Still though, if you're looking to learn a bit more about Norse Mythology, then this is a great way to start!Read full review >
This movie has all the potential to do well, but it fails miserably. There are some interesting ideas, and some good acting, but the film lacks anything truly original or worth seeing."|0
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us through the lives and struggles of a group of African Americans living in Louisiana during World War II. The first thing is that it's absolutely terrible. There's no other word for it--it's just bad. Bad movies have a habit of making me feel good about my life, like I'm participating in some sort of noble struggle. And even better, when I see a truly awful movie, I want to help people. But this movie has none of that.|0
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie starts to drag and I can hardly get through any of it as it just keeps getting worse.In my opinion this film is nothing but an excuse to take some random people and make them look crazy, even if that means making them look ridiculous.If you are not a fan of silly movies then stop watching it right now.There is nothing interesting about it at all and I would have thought that the makers of this film would know better since they are from Hollywood.|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only has a cult following. It's a spoof on modern family films such as How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1985) and even more recent films like A Very British Coup (1995). I was lucky enough to see this in a Cineplex movie theatre over the holidays. I really wish they hadn't put this out in theatres. This was a poor excuse for a family film. My husband and I sat through almost two hours of non-stop cringe worthy jokes.|0
"No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave some good feedback to the show. So if anyone reading this is in the Seattle area, it is highly recommended that you check this guy out and see what his opinions are on the show.I'm sorry that I am writing this but...this was one of the dumbest reviews I have ever read. What happened to ""Reviewers Beware""? It's like watching your childhood dream come to life all over again. It's like when you're a kid and someone gives you a brand new toy."|0
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch this film. It's all very slow and drawn out. This movie has some great moments but it is not really a good movie. The story is weak, the plot is weak, the acting bad, the direction is bad, there is no sense of excitement in what is supposed to be an action flick, the music is just annoying. I was hoping they could have pulled off something cool or at least created a believable world with lots of characters for the movie to take place within.|0
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that carries him off to some Caribbean island. Here, he becomes the stewardess and is then forced to work with her. This film is one of my worst experiences ever. I was 13 when this happened and I am ashamed to say that I actually enjoyed watching it (even though I had not paid for it yet) as a child. I have no recollection of ever seeing such a poor movie until years after. The acting was awful. The script was atrocious.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared out of your pants. I mean, what are the chances that this movie could have been even close to half a year earlier? I actually bought this on video because I am not a huge horror fan and don't see the appeal in it. The movie is about a girl who is taken to a haunted mansion by her friend (Amber). A couple of ghosts appear to attack them at every turn.|0
"Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best one of them. It's not just a bad episode, but I can't recall any other episode that could even be considered a ""bad episode"" as it is here. While the premise itself sounds good enough, the execution falls short of the potential and the story itself fails to deliver. I watched this film in the first 10 minutes. And I hated it. For starters, there was no dialog. We are presented with nothing more than a scene of a man and his dog playing together."|0
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a B-movie, which isn't much to ask from a director who has directed dozens of low-budget films. What I can't believe is that he was allowed to direct this flick. He clearly had absolutely no idea what he was doing and never once considered making the film any better.The acting is good, with a few exceptions. I watched this movie last month at the festival, and there's one thing I learned after watching it.|0
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been great ) but it was certainly fun and very informative. They showed us how to make homemade sauces such as garlic sauce and hot sauce . We came by this store to purchase some of the items that we wanted for gifts for our grandchildren, so that they could enjoy them even if they are not in the immediate family. Although we were able to find each item that we wanted at this store, with the exception of the Christmas tree, we were unable to return any of the items.|0
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . There is little in the way of suspense and no sense of urgency. It's just a waste of a good story. As I said in my preview , this film is bad enough as it is without having to add something extra. If you're looking for an idea for a horror movie, or if you're looking for some inspiration for your own creative work, look no further than Death Wish III.|0
"Chucky ( the murderous doll from `` Child 's Play '' and 2 crappy sequels ) is dead . But he can't die in a movie without leaving a nasty taste in the mouths of his fans. With this film you can tell that it was put together by two idiots with no clue as to how to write a story or plot. A group of girls decide to kill themselves because they think they're really ugly. No one believes them, but none of them wants to be around them. ""Cult of Chucky"" is what happens when people make a film out of things they don't even like."|0
"This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between the three of them are very believable. I don't care what anyone says about this movie, it's just not very good. It doesn't take long to figure out that most of the plot lines are made up by the characters. Not only that, all of the supporting characters (the police, the judge, the prosecutor, etc.) are portrayed in such a way that you can easily identify them as ""not credible""."|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched him in 'Shawshank Redemption' after years of waiting for the right time to make a film. In my humble opinion he made the best film that was ever made. He managed to make an excellent drama and an absolutely fantastic comedy (The Shawshank Redemption is not only funny but a masterpiece ) without resorting to bad acting, terrible plot or boring cinematography. I'm always curious about what people are saying about any given movie. With this exception, it doesn't look like much of a ""movie."""|0
"This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I have my doubts. It is funny but it is also very sad. I was looking forward to seeing ""The Bob & Eddie Show"" since the TV series was so good. Well, this has nothing to do with the TV series. The plot is lame, the dialogue is laughable, and the acting is poor. If you enjoy watching old movies, especially ones that are made for TV, then this may interest you.If you don't, then by all means skip this one."|0
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about drug abuse and murders . It was the only film I could watch in a few days (I don't do that much online ) and it still got me talking. The acting was good , the script is not as clever as i expected , but at least it wasn't so cheesy that I had to throw it away. If you are looking for a realistic movie , this may be for you, but if you want a thriller , then stick to your B movies .|0
"The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save the boy. But, he was killed ! For those that don't know, ""Boys Don't Cry"" is an American action comedy film from the 1980s about a group of teenage boys who go off to sea to search for a kidnapped girl. In this film, however, the boys never find the girl and are forced to re-enact the event by going back to the beach where the kidnapper's body was found."|0
Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to convey all his emotions on the page. He gives us a very good look into the early days of Sam and Dean's relationship.Busey's character is very relatable. We get to understand him more and more throughout the book as he struggles to learn how to trust people, how to live without Dean, and himself. It's extremely interesting to follow the development of these characters from when they're boys through the time they become full-fledged heroes.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make you think that it was trying something new, but overall . it didn't live up to all my expectations. I really enjoyed this show, and was looking forward to seeing it again after being disappointed at how the second season (the one that I saw) did not go far enough for me. And boy oh boy, did it disappoint! Not only was the character development lacking, the acting was so bad that it seemed almost like there were actors watching from the audience.|0
Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , it must have seemed like the best thing that happened since the invention of soap operas. It has all the hallmarks of a bad movie, if you ask me. If I was a teenager who wanted to see a comedy about a poor boy growing up in an Italian neighborhood, I probably would have made some kind of comment about how awful it looks.The plot is extremely contrived, and the whole thing is completely devoid of humor.|0
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from one mood to the next. Unconditional Love (1972) - I found this film in an older DVD box with a bunch of titles, and decided to just watch it. I'm not sure if this was a mistake or what, but there is absolutely nothing that could have been done to make it any more tolerable. The scriptwriters are clearly trying to use humor to make fun of some very serious topics.The film is set in the early 1970's in Seattle, Washington.|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by Jo√£o Falc√£o, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
"A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at the end it does give hope to people who are victims of cults. It's hard to tell for certain, but if you know what you're getting into, then you might find this to be an interesting film. The premise is interesting - we get to see just how a small ""cult"" would go about recruiting new members. It gets rather ridiculous pretty quickly as they attempt to convince a young couple that joining them has some sort of spiritual benefits."|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a little bit of acting chops in his repertoire. But he has no charisma whatsoever. I am not sure who this John Cusack character is supposed to be. Yes, I understand there is some historical significance to his life (even if it is fictional), but beyond that? It doesn't even sound like him. When I was a kid watching old episodes of SNL I thought it was very funny when they would do different characters from each other.|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
"This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i had a lot of fun watching it , but i hated the end. I loved this film from the first minute I watched it, but I didn't really like it until about 20 minutes in. At that point I began to feel as though I was watching an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"", or perhaps some sort of science fiction/horror series. Not that these are bad films by any stretch of the imagination, quite the contrary."|0
"William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about the South. But there's so much more to be learned about the lives of the Southern whites from this great writer and his book, ""The River."" This movie is just plain lame! There are so few interesting points to make that I am almost embarrassed to admit to buying it. This is definitely not a serious movie. The only reason anyone would have to see it is for the cheap laugh at the expense of the real people who were forced to live in such poor circumstances."|0
"The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't bad , but the plot doesn't hold your interest. In fact you can easily skip this movie for it's lame plot and characters . I've been to one of those kids movies where the kid gets sucked in by his/her crush , and the love story starts from there :-o
Okay, so I am a huge fan of the TV show ""The Adventures of Superheroes"" as well as its spin-offs ""Aquaman"" & ""Sharkticon."""|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he's friends with cared for him at all. He acted like nothing is happening to him, and in the end he just wanted to take revenge on someone that insulted him. But I found the whole character extremely annoying, and it got really irritating when he would talk to himself . It's like he's trying too hard to come up with some good rap name. I have watched this movie about 3 times now. Its a bad movie.|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
"The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch it at least three times weekly. I've never been able to grasp why the producers of this TV series decided to portray a small country in such an unfriendly way. I have lived in Italy for over thirty years, so I always had the opportunity to see many different types of culture, but in this case you can't really judge any kind of people by how they act when abroad. I read somewhere that this show is like ""America's Next Top Model"" without the reality factor."|0
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the title hero into something less than worthy. I'm not sure what is so special about this film that it warrants another viewing, but I can guarantee you that if you have to see it again, it won't be at all worth your time and energy. Let's just look at some of the other reviews here on IMDB; ""the worst movie I've ever seen in my life....and I've been watching movies for 45 years""."|0
"( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly here . I think a more appropriate word for ""strange and beautiful"" would be strange and disturbing . The story is very odd. What we are shown is quite literally a train crash, so there are some scenes in which there is no sound at all. The main character (played by Daniel Ritchie) appears to be acting as if he is awake, but in reality he is totally out of it. It is like he is having a schizophrenic experience."|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness "", in which an American soldier stumbles back into his homeland only to find it under Nazi occupation. I just finished watching all four parts of this series and have to tell you that my expectations were completely off. I wasn't prepared for what I got. One of the main reasons that I've always disliked British TV dramas is that they often leave me wanting more. In this instance, however, I would consider myself lucky."|0
First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written on that page , and I can assure you , he was wrong about everything . There's no way in hell that a kittiwake is anything close to a rattlesnake . They're more than 50 feet wide at the widest point and, even if they were, their fangs don't measure longer than a quarter of an inch . I saw this movie as a teen and have always been interested in snakes. I remember seeing one in some old horror film from the 50's called Snakeman which was very cool.|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with a girl ( Rosie Perez ) who he has a crush on. He falls in love with her but she doesn't seem to like him. She keeps trying to make him jealous, and even tries to break up with him. I thought this was one of the most boring and predictable films ever. It's not just because there are really not much plot twists or anything interesting happening at all.The film is based on a book by David Drake which is pretty good, but not exactly compelling.|0
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch, so picked this one up hoping for something that would entertain me for a while.The film centers on a young man named John who runs away from home in search of his missing father (played by the late Jack Nicholson). The plot is convoluted and rather predictable. You know exactly what's going to happen when it finally happens. But there is no need to worry, as the story unfolds in an entertaining and creative manner. You could call this a bad movie.|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ram√≠rez."|1
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play. The acting was superb and I was amazed at the sheer range of characterisation in such an ensemble cast. I would love to hear someone actually explain why this film is terrible. Why, for example, would a person ever think it was appropriate to show a child as a victim in a rape case? When you've been raped by your stepfather do you take him to court? You don't. And neither should you be able to get away with showing a woman getting raped.|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of each of the cast and the excellent editing. The plot is extremely predictable, but not boring by any stretch. There is some great acting throughout the film.The music is quite good though it should be noted that it is a bit over the top when compared to the action scenes. This film is one of those rare pieces of cinema that will have you turning the pages in your book or DVD player looking forward to seeing what comes next!|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
"Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n ' roll . The young singer/songwriter had no clue what to do with his music except play it fast and loud. He was thrown into the wild and woolly world of ""rock'n' roll"" with no idea how to survive in it. This film was not even funny. I couldn't believe they put something like this together. Buddy Holly is supposed to be a hero, yet here he is getting his ass kicked by Elvis Presley! That's about as funny as it gets."|0
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
"I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following, but thought that the plot would not be too far off from the Hollywood movies I was used to. And I was right about that. How do you make a terrible film worse? The first step seems obvious--make the actors sound as bad as their dialogue suggests. That's basically what director David Susskind did with his ""horror comedy"" Night of the Demon (1985), which he wrote and stars in."|0
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for best film of the festival ), and being nominated for two Oscars (Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor), is actually a piece of garbage.I have watched it twice, both times I felt no sense of excitement over the story, the performances were not believable, and the cinematography is bad. This movie is a waste of 20 minutes of your life that could be used to learn something about how to write or make movies.|0
Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over two hours it wasn't very well done. I am so disappointed. I have seen this movie three times already, but everytime I try to see it on the big screen, I cannot watch it anymore. It's not that I do not want to see it again, I do. But after seeing it once in my life, I never wish to see it a third time. Not even if they are offering it as a gift.|0
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes you , after watching the movie for a minute , is not only that he's really good , it seems like all his movies are really good . And we're talking about a man who produced some of the most beautiful and important paintings of this century ... It was supposed to be a great thriller. The movie was so terrible, even the acting was bad, I can't imagine anyone would actually get paid to act in such rubbish. The story didn't work.|0
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
"Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and loneliness. In one of her dreams she sees a handsome young man whom she is attracted to. She asks for his help and he shows up, but she turns him away saying ""I don't want you to look at me"". It's really heart wrenching to watch as he takes this girl out to dinner only to be told off when she turns him down. This movie was terrible. I have never seen such a poor movie."|0
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in fact, it's funny and a little creepy at the same time. The animation quality is good, even some of the gore effects are well drawn (I'm not a horror freak but still...), and the voice acting is very good. You can tell that everybody was enjoying making this show, because they were getting paid by the minute to do so! I didn't understand what the big deal was with this thing.|0
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . I think they all made their best performances. The story is well told . There's no plot holes . Every scene had its place in the overall picture . If you enjoy horror movies you should check this film out. I really didn't know what to expect from this one as I have not read the comics, but the trailers were very misleading. I really expected a slow paced horror film that would take forever to get there. That was not at all the case.|0
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it on a roadtrip, we had been looking forward to this one. The plot is about a group of children who find out that they are being controlled by a toy soldier in order for the villain to get them to take part in a world invasion. The story itself was very cliche as you know what happens after the end credits; kids discover that there is a giant robot in the house and the bad guy turns out to be their uncle who has hidden his evil plan in their doll room.|0
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and colorful live show . He always seemed to come out on top in most fights or incidents , and made sure everyone knew he was the winner in any situation . A typical low-budget Hollywood product. The screenplay is so thin, even the actors can not get through it. The special effects look bad. The music sounds cheesy. It all comes off as a cheap throwaway movie.The acting is good, but they must have really tried too hard to act this way!|0
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to call this a travesty. There are NO redeeming qualities to this piece of junk. And let's face it, there really shouldn't be. It was bad enough that it cost an estimated $150,000 to produce. For comparison, the budget for the first Twilight movie was $20 million dollars (and we don't even get to know what Bella and Edward are up to before the big showdown). I actually watched this movie with the sound off.|0
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
"This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various ages, but I'm sure that a lot of people who have never been made to feel what I felt will still find this film absolutely hilarious.The only reason I didn't rate it higher is because of the low rating of the writing. This was not a story worth reading, just an extremely long and drawn out one. It is a great shame that many people don't watch the documentary series called A&E's ""Sons of Anarchy""."|0
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
"The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines were not bad , the actors did a good job . I hope that the writer of the book comes up with a sequel. One of the worst books ever made. A ""horror"" film about an evil family who abduct kids in order to feast on their blood and brain. What's wrong with your parents? You're supposed to be protecting them, aren't they? And what about the fact that the main character is completely obsessed with her own mother!"|0
1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film he was involved with. I've been meaning to write up a piece of my childhood for a while, but it never quite got off the ground. One day, I found the movie, and realized that I had a lot to say about this movie - and lots to do with Swoope. There's not a whole lot to say about this flick, other than its basic premise is stupid and unappealing.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it . This is probably one of the worst made movies I've ever seen. To me it's just not a good movie. The directing, editing, and actors are all horrible. This movie tries to tell you about the future by using a bunch of stock scenes that have already been done before. They are boring as hell. The plot is absolutely nothing.I would recommend this movie for childrens or teenagers who don't want to watch other terrible movies.|0
I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there on the shelves now. This film has got to be one of the most stupid things i've ever seen.There's no plot and I don't know why anyone would choose to do this in the first place. The script reads like a list of things that you can do at the beach, but then you never see it actually done, so how does the film make money? Oh wait...it doesn't.|0
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time .I have seen many good movies about the holocaust, but i never saw such a perfect depiction of the events as this. This is one of the most awful films I have ever seen. It is so painful to watch. The film starts off with people running around in fear. Then it moves on to show what happens after a bomb goes off. People are dead and bodies are everywhere. It is all so horrible and sad. What kind of people could make something like this?|0
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
* * 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Brian Van Holt , Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams . I guess this movie is better than it gets credit for in the film industry.The story is a bit repetitive. The characters do not seem to have any depth or growth. I thought that I was going to be pleasantly surprised on seeing this movie as I had heard so many positive comments from my friends! I went into this expecting one of the best movies of the year, but what a let-down!! This movie will make you feel sick to your stomach.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much more¬ómeaning it's my kind of film!|1
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be doing something else. This movie has been dubbed so bad, that you might wonder if the people involved in the making of this are still alive. It is a shame that someone could have such poor judgement about what to dub a movie; I don't understand why people try to ""improve"" movies for the home audience. This movie just makes me angry. I thought it was interesting how they did an adaptation of the original book, without having read it!"|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was shocked at the amount of gore involved in this movie . All the way through I was thinking they were using real guns to make this movie look so cool . This movie took itself way too seriously and didn't have the sense to try and scare the audience . There were some pretty serious scenes that left me shaking my head in confusion . It has been several years since I've seen A Nightmare on Elm Street, which is one of the reasons why I decided to rewatch this movie.|0
"I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it !The story has all the charm of a very badly thought out children's game show. And what's worse is that the rules are so vague, you feel like you are just wasting your time by trying to find out where you can get rid of your bad luck.There are some good moments but they are not enough to compensate for the tedious and poorly paced movie. You have to be either insane or a liar to think that this is a ""good"" movie."|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to the front line and has a hard time, but eventually becomes a real hero when he kills a German captain. This was a truly dreadful film. There is one scene that is genuinely funny, but it's pretty rare in this genre.The acting is very wooden, and all of the characters seem contrived. The only reason I rated this at 2 instead of 3 is because of the story.I don't understand why a man would go to war for anything other than love.|0
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with some good special effects but nothing to write home about... I saw this in the cinema, it was advertised as a comedy, which it was. It wasn't very funny, even the jokes were not funny at all. As far as I know no one has ever made a film that could be described as humourless. However, there were some clever bits in the film. The only problem is that you have to really pay attention to the actors.|0
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it even more with the 2 hours of time I had to watch it . The premise was interesting , the story was interesting , the cast was interesting and most of all the acting was well done. In short , there are a lot of things wrong with this movie but it is at least worth watching . If you like science fiction, then you'll want to keep reading. This isn't your average film. It starts off extremely slow, with some characters who don't even appear for a while.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpiece¬Öit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` No Easy Way 's'' ? Then the next time you see them at the cinema, keep a look out for them. The acting is good although not very original in comparison with most Hollywood movies. The movie is not scary and has little suspense. It's just one big family comedy with all the clich√©s that come to mind when a person goes on holiday without his wife. I would recommend this film, but I would also suggest reading the comments before you decide to watch it.|0
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks. This is one of his worst films yet. He has no sense of urgency in the story or atmosphere. At the beginning I was hoping for more than a boring zombie movie. This film was awful. The acting was bad, the plot was nonsensical and there was not much of any substance to the whole story. I think the reason it's rated so high is because of what it lacks. It didn't have anything that stood out other than the vampires and the zombies.|0
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
"What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and Michael Madsen for making such an extraordinary film. And I am not exaggerating in any way either. This is by far one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, and that includes some really dull films. The plot involves two friends who end up going on a road trip together (they call it ""messing around""), they end up getting into a big argument, and then murder each other. That's it!"|0
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare piece that i would pay money for. It looks like a real jewel but it was not. The only thing it has in common is an old bottle, so how could its value be high? There are some good pictures and description on the internet , but i doubt they will help me sell my $500. It's probably one of those movies you love to hate, or just find boring, because you're too preoccupied to notice the ridiculous plot holes.|0
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , please don't. This is an abomination and a waste of time for anybody who wants to see this movie with their family, friends, and anyone else they want to have a good time with. I really feel bad for having wasted my time, energy, and money on this film. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. And I'm a huge fan of B movies.The dialogue is cringe-worthy and the acting is absolutely horrible.|0
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his best in this role, and he delivers one of the great performances of all time. The only problem is that it is rather too much about him. It's a well-meaning movie which suffers from some glaring miscasting , particularly in Quaid's part. I saw this movie last night on TV, as I am very much into sci-fi shows. I was impressed with how well the characters were developed and the premise intriguing. After seeing the trailer I have to ask myself: why?|0
"This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families behind in Africa for more comfortable lifestyles. I think it's interesting because it is a story about race and what happens when people of different races mix with each others. In the case of this movie, the film makers have done a great job of creating a complex situation in which the main character tries to prove that ""it"" doesn't really matter where you were born or where you want to go."|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald (who I believe is played by Paul Muni) gets his ass whooped in a basketball game. He's left on the bench while all the big boys get to play. His girlfriend decides to go out and have some fun. This movie started with the premise that there was no point in making a comedy unless you can also make a crime thriller. And from that premise the movie went downhill from there.|0
I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face from laughing so hard because I couldn't even find words to describe the funniness of the whole thing.This film is about an elderly woman who gets trapped in a cave by two teenagers and all hell breaks loose when someone tries to open the cave for her . After watching it, I just couldn't get past the fact that none of the characters seemed to have personalities other than their sex appeal (or lack thereof).|0
Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience makes him see his father as a serial killer, and he believes he will be next. After being shot, they decide to go back and get medical help for him. Later, at the camp, Sawyer and Juliet discuss what happened in the water. I have seen so many movies from this series that I almost feel ashamed that I haven't seen it yet. If you want to see a very well done horror/fantasy/sci-fi hybrid with a solid plot, check this one out.|0
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! The film is entertaining, well-acted, well-directed. But what really impressed me were the kids in it. I'd heard that there were children in the movie but never thought much about it. But to my surprise, there were 5 little kids working their way through the plot line and acting like professional actors. ""Electioneering: The American Way,"" directed by Donald Ayer (""Suicide Squad""), may be the worst movie I have seen in a long time."|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
"Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona is that of the lovable buffoon who just plain makes fun of himself. But, as a comic-turned-actor, Garlin does a fine impersonation of Tom Arnold's character. It took about 10 minutes to realize something was different about this movie. I'd seen it at the Cineplex in Toronto for $10 a ticket, and didn't expect much (except maybe ""Arnold in space"" or ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"")."|0
( Synopsis ) Graduating high school senior Bartleby `` B '' Gaines ( Justin Long ) finds himself without a job in his hometown of Philadelphia. Noticing a newspaper ad for a new software company, he gets on the phone and makes a meeting with the receptionist. This movie left me feeling very unfulfilled. It didn't take any great risks and was predictable at times. Even worse, the acting was bad. The one actor who stood out as being really good was James Doohan , but he wasn't given much to work with.|0
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a hard time watching it, he said it is not for the faint of heart at all. I read the other reviews on here but I really didn't see much that I could complain about in this film. It's not a very good movie but it certainly isn't bad or boring either. We watched it on Saturday morning and we laughed our tails off most of the time! If you don't want to feel sorry for them, then don't watch it.|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every scene with the same clothes on . The only reason why this movie was worth watching for me is because it gave me hope that I could find some new movies like this which were entertaining and made you think instead of just watching the same old boring bad movies . I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised by this movie, in hopes that it might have more than a few chuckles thrown in. What a waste of time. Every single joke was one-dimensional (in my opinion).|0
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
"Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a lot of nudity only made me more turned on! But I was so confused by the whole idea of the film. Why were we all topless in a movie called ""Romeo and Juliet""! The fact that these two actors were playing the characters didn't matter as it wasn't written like that. Why do I feel sorry for whoever directed this abominable slasher flick? After watching it I can't believe I still watched it."|0
"Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find an architect who will design a house as simple as he needs it to be. I was disappointed that this movie, like so many others before it, failed to really explore the lives of those who make such grand houses. Wow. Just wow. If you watched this movie, you know that I am a fan of architecture. The first two movies on this list just reinforced that. But what's this? ""My Architect?"""|0
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this film at a local independent cinema in New York with my boyfriend and we both cried during the whole movie! I didn't mind the story line. It was cute and romantic. This is probably one of those movies where if you're like me and you're too stupid to figure out what the hell it is you're doing, just don't watch it. The plot consists of several characters who are all living together, but have very different stories.|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in his interactions. He really does look like he wants to do a better job. I think that if you're an American who's ever watched any form of animated film at least once, you've seen this one. I got to it fairly recently, and I have to admit, I was intrigued by its premise, because I'm the kind of viewer who will watch cartoons just so they can hear the voices of their favorite actors.|0
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but also with the necessary gravitas required to play such a subject. What's most remarkable is that his performance never seems contrived or overblown, and the script offers an intriguing premise: a man who kills women is sentenced to be executed. A few weeks ago I saw this movie on a cable channel and was amazed at the quality of the special effects they were showing it on. Well, now I've watched it more than once and decided that I really didn't mind too much about their CGI.|0
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both shows are still a huge letdown for me. If you really want to know what kind of movie it is - stop watching it!! I don't understand why people like this rubbish so much. The film itself was pretty terrible, the acting was horrible, and some scenes just made no sense at all. Even the song which they played in the opening credits could have been better suited for another film.|0
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the premise very hard to take in and what's worse it had all the elements that one would expect in a horror movie. There were things that didn't add up, there was a huge amount of suspense which was completely lost on me. I can't really say why but I just couldn't put it down. The acting was pretty bad too, most of the actors seemed to have no idea what they were doing at times. What is going on here?|0
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction and story line were very good . The acting was pretty bad but there was something charming about the main character . If you are a movie buff, or have any idea about filmmaking, then you will be blown away by this film. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. For starters, it is badly dubbed. The lines sound like someone was trying to imitate American English. Then there is the atrocious plot.|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters as The Complete Tales of Bigfoot. If I may venture a guess, I think it might be the same director who directed ""Night of Terror"" and ""The Mystery of the Strangeness Man."" This film was a combination of many of his other films. First of all, the main character in this film does not have the ability to move around on two legs or run from predators (which is what a lot of these movies involve)."|0
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be a few errors, some rather serious ones.I have no idea on the age of the actors, I don't know where they were cast in the movie, or where they were directed, or what their motivations are. The acting was fine, but so were most other parts of that movie. There weren't nearly enough films like that around to make it worth watching. Also, this movie had little to do with its own subject matter; it's more an excuse to look at naked girls.|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who he was and I can't even remember how I came across the film. The Buddy Holly Story is a bad movie, to be sure. It has all the qualities of a bad movie: poor plot, terrible acting, low budget, cheap special effects, lousy music, and just generally bad acting. And it does indeed have many of these elements. However, there are a number of problems with the movie which make it not nearly as bad as others might have thought it would be.|0
But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and Paul McGann ! I'll start by saying, that this film isn't as bad as it seems. The story line is interesting enough to get you to watch it, even if you can see the plot holes in the very beginning. But the characters weren't developed enough to give them an emotional depth beyond the surface. It took about half of the film for me to come to terms with how much I hated all three main characters (especially Pryce).|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you in . If this film had been cut together, it would have made a great thriller. It is also just plain funny. The only real problem I had was that I really didn't enjoy the acting. This is a movie that makes me wonder how many other films were written and made, but not allowed to be produced. At first I laughed so hard I was afraid I was going to catch an infection from laughing too hard.|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen. We would get them as a ""taste of the month"" type deal. They were always crap. I don't think anyone has ever made a movie in which they say, 'I'm sorry! This movie is crap!' The movie begins with an old black guy sitting in his porch smoking a pipe and reminiscing about his life. He's on some sort of retirement plan, but he's not sure why."|0
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is a disgrace . It has nothing to do with the quality of the movie. I watched it in the cinema, on my own. The only reason why I watched it in the cinema was because I heard good reviews from people I know who were also at the cinema that night. To me, there are two types of films. First type is B-movies. These are pretty much trash. But then you have something like this. There is nothing bad or good about this movie.|0
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Lustig, but if you're looking for a thriller or even a decent horror flick then you've got to go elsewhere. This one just didn't hit the mark at all. A couple of years ago I bought this DVD for my wife. It was so bad, it made me laugh. Then I found myself watching it again, and she laughed again. I gave it a second chance and let her watch it too. This is another story.|0
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
"Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss. The story involves two lovers who are separated from each other after the death of their father (who has left his wife to be with another woman) and while in different cities. After watching the trailer for ""Husbands & Lovers"" I thought it might be a fun romantic comedy about young people who fall in love, marry, have babies and stay together long enough to get their affairs in order. Well not so much.The film opens up with two guys in an elevator."|0
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Blair and Jack Gilford . They are played by veteran actors who know how to deliver strong acting. Unfortunately, the supporting cast is pretty lacking. I don't normally watch horror flicks so I wasn't sure what to expect when I came across this one. I'm glad I did though, as it's a fun little flick that has an interesting story to it. It's not afraid to be disturbing either, as there are plenty of gruesome scenes throughout.|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but it still was worth a watch i am sure to many of you reading this also. I really like the original The Thing (1982) when I was a teenager. This movie is pretty much just an imitation of the first movie. If you look at all the scenes in this movie you can easily tell that they're just ripped from the first movie. There's no real tension built up in the second movie and the suspense doesn't exist.The characters aren't any better either.|0
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which we have to solve. This movie shows us that this is a society which has lost its moral values. I cannot imagine how anyone would want to spend a day and a half to watch this rubbish. I remember watching this movie way back in the early 90's, because it looked so good, I couldn't help myself. I was very happy when I finally bought it on DVD, and watched it for the first time.|0
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not a solid film. While there are some issues with the story, it does feature some of the best gore in a giallo (that I've seen yet). Some of the bloodletting looks great, and the acting was top notch. The script was pretty good, too. Unfortunately, the plot is a bit haphazard, and the director/producer seemed like he never really wanted this film made. This is absolutely the most horrible movie ever produced.|0
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
"Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just a load of crap. I'm going to begin by admitting that I have not seen much of the film ""The Conjuring 2"". That said, I am willing to overlook this because after watching the trailer for this flick, I found it to be incredibly disturbing! What can I say about this film that hasn't been said hundreds of times before in reviews? The premise seems so simple and the ending so satisfying. So why was I compelled to share this review on my own blogs?"|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really add up, there's not even that much happening to keep your attention at any point except for the end.The main problem here is that the plot is so simple you'd think it would be obvious, yet it isn't as the first two episodes made it seem like. I'm pretty sure this show was never intended to be watched by people who like action/comedy, because I honestly thought they were making fun of each other.|0
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch and want to know what was REALLY said during the show's run. I've watched the series 3 or 4 times but have yet to see it all together.The main reason I watched the show is because a friend and I had been trying to get a laugh from the jokes we knew about and couldn't find many, so we decided to see if SPOILERS FROM THE SHOW were funny. We thought they would be. We were WRONG!|0
A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great music , and an exciting thriller . There was one thing though , which I can't put my finger on, which left a bitter taste. There are very few films in Hollywood that are as disturbing as this one! The story is about a group of English businessmen who travel to South America in search of oil; for some reason they get lost along the way, leading to a bloody confrontation with a gang of Native American Indians.|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
"Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I have to admit that I had a really hard time getting through this movie due to it being an awful rip-off of ""Dracula"". The premise is pretty terrible and the special effects (in general) are not as impressive as they would have been 30 years ago when this first came out. The main difference between the two movies is that in ""Dracula"" the creature has three heads. It's just that this one is a lot more stupid."|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be on the receiving end. The only other movie I remember being like this was Saving Private Ryan . It's not a very good movie, but at least they made it more entertaining because there is a plot. I did not watch the show when it was on. I am sorry for everyone that did. The acting was terrible, and the jokes were so cheesy. I am glad that the show hasn't gotten any better since then. This film is just as bad.|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who can do nothing and his girlfriend (who can't say anything). And you have to give them credit for that. This was a very funny show with great dancing , some great songs . I saw this show at the Chameleon club in Hollywood and thought it was a rip off of Singin' In The Rain, but if that's true , it wasn't even close. Wow...the worst movie ever made!|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies for entertainment , not education, and if the movie has a great storyline and is directed by a good actor i will see it but if its a train wreck i might not want to sit through it . Im going to put this as straight forward as i can : The script is horrible . The plot is so cliche that it makes me laugh almost every minute of the movie . The directing is atrocious . The acting is terrible . The editing is horrendous .|0
"The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. He decided not to have any acting training when he signed up, which meant that he had to learn just about every aspect of being an actor in order to be able to act in movies. It didn't make much sense though, since he wasn't really a ""actor"" at all. The fact that Chaplin was only 19 years old and his films were pretty popular as a result should have been reason enough for him to take acting classes."|0
I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store, then I checked IMDb and was shocked that I had seen it in there. This is one hell of a mess. There is so much that is wrong with this movie. The acting is so bad you want to run screaming from the cinema. It's so hard to find words to describe how horrible the acting is. The whole thing makes me want to commit suicide. My only saving grace is that all the sex scenes are really hot.|0
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
Years ago I read the book 'A M√°quina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and it works because we have to relate to the characters somehow. But many times, it just falls flat. In ""Sleeping Beauty,"" if you watch it with a little distance, you might even find some moments of humour, but they are pretty fleeting. To say that I was excited to see ""Sleeping Beauty"" would be giving it too much credit (it's one of my favorite films), so I'm not going to get into the whole slasher/slasher film aspect of the story."|0
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now its time for Chucky: Part 4 and its really, REALLY bad . It has no story , no tension , no scares , no chills , it just goes on forever and ends in some kind of horrible explosion . I feel like I should go home and kill myself . If you've never seen a Stephen King film then this will probably not be your cup of tea.But if you have seen them then I would recommend that you don't bother with this one.|0
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening screening and I had so much fun. (I saw a preview of the movie, but didn't sit down for it). The plot is interesting enough that you probably won't go out of your way to watch it. I have to admit, I was expecting a bit of a better movie than this. The premise is good: an orphan girl finds herself living with a family she barely knows. There are some pretty decent acting skills on display here.|0
"Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and an amazing cameo appearance by Jack Lemmon - who is one of the few people to win an Oscar in both the horror category and the thriller category at the same time -it takes a whole new twist on the ""scary doll"" genre.In short, you have a bad guy dressed as a little doll named Chucky who breaks into a house and murders all of the guests. If you're a fan of scary movies, this movie is for you."|0
"My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had answers. After seeing this, I am seriously considering putting this on my ""to watch"" list next time I go to the movies. There are a couple other films I have seen that could also merit a spot on such a list: ""Dirty Dancing"" (a good movie, no doubt, but not a classic), ""I'll Do Anything"" (a decent movie, although not the best) and ""Mulholland Dr"" (a good movie, but not the best)."|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary story . I found the premise a little hard to swallow at first but the deeper I went into the documentary the more I fell for it and came to the conclusion that if it were true then they probably didn't make it too far into the documentary.I saw this film twice and enjoyed it both times, but I must say I am disappointed that I had to pay for the second viewing. The first viewing is still the best I have ever experienced.|0
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
"I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I can't believe that I even used those words )
There are two very different stories about this film. The first is the one in which it was set, and the other is what actually happened. On the one hand, it was shot in the 1950s and its stars included Fredric March and Jean Harlow. This version of the story suggests that it would have been a big hit. And yet it didn't really do well at the box office."|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
"The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the work. In its own way, it's like watching a horror movie from the early 1930s and finding out that it's being done again by a Hollywood production crew in 2017. The only reason I even saw this movie is because my friend recommended it to me during one of our many discussions about movies. This is definitely not an ""A"" movie. There is something off about the story line, which could be said about the premise itself."|0
Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives. I have come across one or two others on DVD but never bought them for whatever reasons. I watched this hoping that it would be interesting enough to keep me from getting bored of it. It actually was not very entertaining at all. The plot is so stupid that it made me feel sick to watch it. You would think that a film crew would have done some research to prepare for a film about teenagers who are obsessed with serial killers.|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how much he's been missed . I saw this film last week, but have only just discovered it now and am yet to give it a proper listen (not that I really needed one). What an awful piece of work. The plot is as uninteresting as the characters, and the special effects are so bad that I actually wondered if they had spent money on them. The acting is simply atrocious and the directing even worse.|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if it didn't have so many awful scenes . It is a good story about a woman who decides to leave her husband for her new lover. So, she meets him at the end of a train and they go on a whirlwind romance . The bad part is that all the other characters in the film do nothing to support the storyline. There are some movies I like more than others. There are also some movies I watch less often than others...and then there is this movie.|0
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . This is another one of those cases . I like the idea of making a film from a script and I have read many interesting books on the subject but this movie fell way short for me.The acting was dreadful, the direction was terrible, the plot was just so bad that I almost felt sorry for the actors. What a waste of talent and money! The setting was totally uninteresting too - all the buildings looked the same with no real contrast in their design.|0
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Bieber is doing it too. this movie looked like it should have made $5 million, but it came close to making 1/3 of that for what it's worth. the only redeeming quality of this piece of crap were the acting. i cannot say enough bad words about these actors. they all seemed to enjoy their roles more than they could possibly give them credit for. if you want some good acting, go see an episode of ""Buffy"" and then see this film."|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times . I don't know why they didn't change it. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . The plot is a disaster . There is not a single moment that you could describe as a good moment. Even the most clich√©d jokes were not funny . And the acting was so horrible . This has got to take the title from the film. This is possibly the very worst film I have ever seen!|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be very similar. The only difference was that there was more swearing in American Pie (which is expected of a PG film) and it also has more sex scenes. So you want to know why I'm giving this movie four out of five stars? Well, one: the acting was awful. Two: the soundtrack was lame. Three: there wasn't any good story whatsoever. Four: everything was filmed with a teleprompter. Five: I couldn't care less about the title.|0
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull was a great character . I can't believe that anyone actually thinks this is funny. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I don't mean that it's bad or that it has anything to do with kids. It's just plain stupid. The plot of this movie revolves around a little girl named Molly who wants to be a warrior. So, she gets her dad to buy her a bunch of dolls, then goes out to fight imaginary goblins.|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
"I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film. That's the way to go. Not only does the acting suck, there are moments that should not have happened. My first thought after watching it was ""is this supposed to be real?"". It is obviously made for TV. This is an extremely disappointing film. The script is so clich√©d and predictable, you can't help but laugh every time a new twist is thrown in your face."|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I'm a big fan of his work as well, but it was still nice to hear him sing some of his songs . What a waste of a perfectly good comedy script. The idea is great: an alcoholic husband and father gets drunk and loses control of his child(s). So the mother (Diane Lane) turns the tables on her abusive husband by becoming his full-time caregiver and disciplinarian. I think there were two movies in the 1980s that managed to have as bad a cast as this one.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall it is a very well-made B movie which has a good amount of laughs and a nice action scene. This was an interesting film to see, as I didn't know that it was based on the books by Stieg Larsson. But, after watching it for the first time, I found it rather boring and pointless. I'm not sure if I would recommend this film to anyone, although I can understand that those who want to see something new and different in a horror movie might find it quite interesting.|0
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language could do no better than learn it. The narration is very interesting and well-written (although I would have preferred a bit more emotion in my narrator's voice), the characterizations are extremely realistic (even though this may sound trite, I believe that you should always try to portray each character with as much depth and humanity as you possibly can), the plot twists and turns are predictable (especially the ending), but still highly entertaining and suspenseful for the first couple of episodes.|0
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
"I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : )
I think this is one of the worst movies that has ever been made. The characters, plot, direction and dialogue are all extremely contrived and lacking any substance whatsoever.There is no explanation why these people live like this, none at all, not even the slightest hint. They don't speak English, or if they do they don't sound anything like a person who spoke English in the 60's or 70's."|0
If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) that has been made by Italy . It is written and directed by Carlo Ponti, a very talented screenwriter.There is a great atmosphere of mystery in this movie , without being overly scary. If you like ghost stories , you won't be disappointed here . After reading several positive reviews from other viewers I had to finally give this film a shot. I didn't want to start with something so clich√©d, as it always seemed to be for all Italian films.|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch because they are just so funny. I am surprised no one wrote a fanfic about this movie but I guess nobody has time to write fanfics about movies that you like and don't actually want to see, right? I'll give this movie some credit though, there are some pretty good jokes in it. The main problem is how the character development is handled. Most of them are forced and feel awkward coming from the writers.|0
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's been used to sell crappy action movies. He seems to be one of the few directors who is actually able to produce good art. This movie, though, does not fall in line with his earlier work. It doesn't make much sense and it just doesn't feel like a Fulci flick. I don't know what went on behind-the-scenes but there's no excuse for a movie this awful. There are only three or four real laughs in this movie.|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli¬¥s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was a really interesting film, but I don't see myself watching it again . This one is even better than the first ( which I haven't seen ) . The actors are great and this one is very well done . Not too long into the movie , I couldn't figure out who was who in the cast ! I think that the writer and director should have put some sort of story line or plot into this movie.|0
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
"As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some Italian movies which I am less familiar with.This is the only film that I really did not understand at all - even though I had already seen it twice (first in a theatre and again in the cinema)
I'd say this is one of the worst movies I ever sat through. It starts off pretty well enough, with a young boy and his older sister living in an old house that was once owned by a couple that lived there before they passed away."|0
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
"Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock musician Jimi Hendrix. So, you've just watched an episode of The Walking Dead (season 1), and you're looking to pick up a movie on your way to work. But instead of heading to the local IMAX theater like you should, you turn around and go to the video rental store instead. And when you finally do catch ""The Devil's Advocate"" at the video store, what do you think of?"|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting '' enough )? If you can't tell by now that this film is one big joke, you're not supposed to watch this movie--unless you're a fan of lowbrow B-grade humor.It starts out as a thriller about an ex-police detective who's been given a copy of a classified memo by a former employee. He then decides to investigate the source of the memo--who happens to be his ex-best friend--but soon finds himself on a trail of intrigue that eventually leads him down a dark path.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The story line is interesting, however i did feel as if there was not much of a point to the plot. It seems like the only goal this film had was to have some really good shots of the landscape. My rating: 1/10This movie has no logic whatsoever. I went into this movie thinking 'I'll be here for an hour or so, and maybe then I'll see what's going on' but in reality, we just sat through two hours of complete and utter pointless drivel.|0
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it was made. The characters are well done, the story is quite interesting and suspenseful without being tedious or maudlin like so much contemporary horror. This movie will have you crying tears of laughter at least a dozen times in its first 40 minutes.The plot revolves around an elderly man's son who is taken away by the state because he has lost his marbles. He tries to help him along the way, and manages to get into some trouble along the way.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
"`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The acting is as good as can be expected from such an obscure and short production. ""Head of the Turtle"" is just about the most unfunny, over-the-top film I have ever seen. It features some very bad jokes - like the scene where a guy comes into a movie theater to see a ""Wizard of OZ"" concert and finds out there's not a live audience in the house (I was watching it with a couple of friends when they laughed their asses off)."|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
"I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing' and it turned out to be a really good movie. I can't say anything more about it as I don't think that it's worth its time at all, but if you want to check it out - go see it for free anyway. I never would have thought that the most famous person to come out of Ireland, Sean ""Pals"" O'Casey, could have made such a terribly amateurish movie."|0
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , 1 in my living room , the other is on a DVD at home. This one isn't really a good movie, but it was fun to watch with the family. My daughter and I were watching it together when her younger sister asked if we wanted to stay up late so we could watch more of it. I had to ask her to leave me alone, because I was enjoying myself far too much.|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
"It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and they don't have it on the net either...I'm sure that's why it was left off the cable list). I didn't see it at first. When I finally saw it I was impressed. As I was watching, I could not stop myself from looking up the cast, thinking ""I should have seen this coming."" This film is just plain bad. Don't waste your time!"|0
`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because he played the lead. Oh, this is the greatest film ever made! I had to watch it again, and again, and again, until I was able to figure out what in hell was going on. What were they trying to accomplish? The plot makes no sense! And even if I did understand why they were doing what they were doing, how does that make the film any good?The characters are unbelievable.|0
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Geary will not be in it, but my mom said it was a good movie. anyway, after watching the movie i realized i should have seen it and then i went to the local theatre with my girlfriend and she started freaking out because she couldnt stop laughing at how bad the acting was. What a complete waste of time, money, energy, and brains this movie was. It has literally no story or purpose other than its own self-insertion. The acting is terrible.|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
"Telling the story would n't be the point at all , would it ? Barnens √∂ , spelled almost like ""Bennen"" and pronounced with an 's' instead of an 'o', is not a common name. I'm not even going to go through how stupid that title sounds. The movie is so bad it actually makes me wonder why this movie even existed in the first place, let alone made it onto DVD. There are very few good movies in the genre of Science Fiction or B-movie. These movies often try too hard to be profound and sometimes come off as silly."|0
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
"This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , if I had made a list of this film's most offensive qualities , it would be very short indeed. When I heard the word ""retarded"" uttered on the screen, my whole body shuddered. Why did I feel so sad? Did something terrible have to happen for that to happen?I was confused, and even more bewildered, at just what the point of this film was. It reminded me of a school play where all the students are playing an imaginary game."|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series debut. The movie is an interesting tale of a couple who fall in love but quickly realize that they cannot be together because of her father's abusive personality. They try to convince their friend to go with them on this adventure but he refuses, and soon decides to spend his free time hanging out with some prostitutes instead. I saw this movie at a small theater near my place and I had to rent it. There wasn't much dialogue and I found it very difficult to understand.|0
"If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved, however, and the book is only available in its entirety on the net. I had high hopes for this book. It promises to be a ""classic"" of the genre...and while it lacks the sophistication of many of its more famous counterparts (such as A Farewell to Arms ), it seems to have something that can be considered classic--an atmosphere, a story, characters who seem believable and complex."|0
As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like 'Gulliver's Travels' and 'The Jungle Book', try to answer some fundamental problems of our species . I'm a huge Disney fan, but this movie was absolutely disappointing. It had potential to be wonderful, but at times it felt like we were being fed a story line that had already been done to death. You can't really help but feel cheated when something you've spent hours and hours trying to decipher comes up with a solution you already knew existed.|0
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to run out of steam , the episodes became more depressing and depressing . And by the time the sixth season started , the show was starting to grate on people . This movie isn't much fun. But I'll give it that, because this is one of those crappy movies you just don't see in theaters any more.It's about a couple who decide to spend some quality time together. They go into the living room, sit around, look at stuff, and so on.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind, and certainly the only one to which I have been subjected. (I should add that there are so many excellent movies out there, some of which I might even have watched.)'' WTF??? I saw this movie with my girlfriend. We bought it as we both had just started watching a little horror/thriller at the same time. I am sure she was expecting something good. WHAT?? This movie sucks!|0
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by the specter of corruption in its local and national institutions. While it's impossible to judge the film for its actual content (there are very few good films about Sicily), there is no question that this was one of the worst American films made during the 1980s. When I was younger, my dad liked to watch bad movies. I don't remember the name of the movie we saw, but I can tell you that it wasn't a good one.|0
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Ant√¥nio (Gustavo Falc√£o) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Ant√¥nio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man who finds himself trapped in an eerie haunted house. His only source of hope is a book that supposedly gives him the answers he needs to escape, but instead it makes him more desperate than ever. This is another movie that has gone completely off the deep end with regards to its storyline, premise, and direction. This is not a good horror movie at all. Let's start with plot: A woman (Mia Sara) is murdered and her head is kept inside a box.|0
"I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti or Raffaelle Battistelli , but I'm sure there are a few of them who can sing pretty good. As far as being ""artsy"" is concerned , I guess it depends on your definition of art. This is one of my least favorite movies, maybe because I've seen almost everything that's come out in the '80s.The acting is terrible, the plot has no logic at all and the ending leaves me speechless."|0
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I'm sorry, but there is no comparison between this show and the one that has been making it's rounds for the past 20 plus years or so . I am not going to waste my precious time rehashing the whole plotline , as it can be summed up in a single word : BORING . There are several issues with this show, first of which is that they tried to change the format of the series from episodic to serialized and failed.|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ') last night and I must say it was one of the best films I have seen this year. It is a masterfully-crafted film that makes you sit back and admire the skill of the movie-makers, even though you could probably guess what's going on from the beginning if you payed close attention. This is not the kind of movie for the faint hearted. You are going to need to do some serious studying before you are able to fully understand its mysteries.|0
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as the first one but it 's pretty much the same movie, only with a different plot.The problem I had with this film was that the story just wasn 't there. You could feel that the producers were just trying to milk every dollar out of this film so they could use it for more money later on. There was nothing memorable or frightening about any of the characters in this film. The acting was all over the place too.|0
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
"I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to make sense it was supposed to be a spoof . You can tell by the dialogs the movie was never intended to be funny . Let me say this right out the gate, I like ""Ghostbusters."" I have enjoyed the series since the original 1984 film and even moreso with the new ones. I am very fond of Egon Spengler, Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Peter Venkman and Harold Ramis' work. However, that does not make this film worth watching or entertaining."|0
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever and funny , this movie really isn't. There's so much potential for comedy in this film, but none of it is delivered. This movie made me sick to my stomach. In the first place I don't find any sense in creating a monster out of nothing at all. Second, why did God send these creatures on a mission to destroy the world? What did they ever do wrong? And what was the purpose of their existence?|0
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps you enthralled.The story revolves around a young boy who, after spending the summer in a secluded house with his parents, accidentally falls in love with a young woman who happens to live in the same house. I'm an avid horror fan, so it wasn't surprising when I saw this on the Sci Fi Channel. But I was pretty disappointed by the lackluster production values. The scares are cheesy and uninspired. They look like they could've been created for a Saturday morning cartoon.|0
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom of this story but the common man and women may not. If you are thinking of making it a date night, think twice ! You could easily spend half your evening in tears . First of all, ""The Wizard of Lies"" is probably the least well-liked Disney movie to ever hit the theatres. Its main problem lies in its blatant disregard for historical accuracy (which makes me want to kill my parents)."|0
"I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video games, cars , politics & much more. It's funny how people get so worked up over this movie when there are hundreds of similar movies that I've found to be just as funny. ""Spy Games"" has some of those elements but it's far worse than ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"" or any of the dozen or so bad 80's-90's comedies I could name off the top of my head without looking them up in a bookstore."|0
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
"Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD HAVE HAD one but instead it had ONE. It's pretty much all over the place. The movie has some great moments but it's a complete mess at the same time. I've seen this film in 4 different forms (not sure which). In the best of the versions I saw (the first being the DVD version), the ""story"" was not very good. There was too much filler, characters were illogical, and the story fell way short of expectations."|0
"When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more importantly, to be human . Well, it's just a terrible film! It starts out very interesting and is full of promise. The characters are good-looking and funny. We're really interested in the story because we want to know who these ""others"" are. Then they reveal that there are no other people in the whole world but their friends, and then all the actors are killed off. It's an anticlimax!"|0
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is the first cartoon in which I could watch my baby watching it.It is one of those things that will never go out of fashion. You can't get any better than this film. The voice acting is perfect. The humor is very well thought out. Even the characters were unique and funny, even to the point of being likable.The fact that the whole movie was shot on video adds an extra layer of realism to the story line.|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this is that every time I think I've seen everything it seems like one joke or stupid story line would be all. This is just a bunch of people talking and never really saying anything . Every time you think you've heard enough , they throw a new joke in for you . A film so horrible, it's not even funny. If I had watched it when I was younger, I would have thrown up from laughing so hard.|0
"I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO channels. I just thought, ""hey this would be cool to check out!"" So I did, then realized that I haven't watched an NFL game in almost a year! So I rewound back to when I actually watched football last and lo and behold, it was here! The first thing I noticed about this show is that every episode ends with a voice-over from the players or coaches discussing how they can improve for the next game."|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I suggest you do it! This film is not without merit. It shows the horrors of WWII. However, it does not portray the reality of what happened to those people. In particular, some scenes that are used in the movie have no real basis in historical fact or common knowledge.For example, when the Germans are told how much they were making from the slave labor they were sending over, they scoff at their pay and state that the money was too high.|0
"My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that I was pleasantly surprised.I've never really seen a ""comic"" movie like this. The humor and the style is pretty good but the script is so bad it makes me want to vomit. I'm sorry to all of you that are going to be looking for a laugh, but there's simply no way to enjoy this one. The plot starts off promisingly enough with some great character development by the main cast."|0
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of those rare movies that you just have to sit down, watch it once and pass it on to your friends/family because it is worth watching. I had no idea what to expect when I went into this film thinking it was going to be about a group of misfits who are forced to travel to some unknown location where they discover something that could save mankind (or at least the planet Earth) in the long term future.|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
"Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I think it's a good movie to watch at night with your girlfriend or friend . Although the story is very basic . But in case you don't want to find out the bad and the good , here are some tips: 1 - Do not have sex on camera . (I was shocked by this ).2 - You should be able to follow the plot . (I am still wondering about the logic of his ""plan"").3 - If you get bored , take a break ."|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is very forgettable and feels more like it was conceived as a joke than a serious attempt to make anything out of. A film with an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes doesn't really have much chance if it has no redeeming qualities at all. However, there are some things about this title that I enjoy. It does a good job of showing the hardships of military life, so we feel for the soldiers in the movie, but unfortunately the movie falls short of being entertaining.|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments ever filmed. However this series does not have much to say, as far as I can tell. A lot of things are missing and what is there is just very unoriginal. One of the biggest complaints I see about this movie is that they cut the scene where the submarine is seen on the beach. Why did they cut this? Because we didn't know it had been destroyed. Well, maybe that's part of the problem, but it's something that could have been easily dealt with.|0
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply stunning romantic comedy. Their relationship is so compelling that you begin to wish the entire movie was devoted solely to their courtship and wedding. I'm not here to judge the quality of the film or its cast, but let me just say: this is the kind of movie that would be better as a DVD extra for someone's list of 'best movies of all-time.' Lane is absolutely magnificent as Edith Keating, a beautiful housewife who has fallen in love with a man who turns out to be a thief.|0
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly serviceable piece of entertainment that has the potential to become a classic. It is a good time to go back and watch an animated film I didn't bother watching when it came out.I would have liked to rate this more highly but felt like I wasn't giving it enough benefit of the doubt because of its rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The story starts with a kid getting his hands on some marijuana from his drug dealer who happens to be looking for a new customer.|0
"Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in and out of the story. It has been said that movies can make you think, it can entertain, it can lift you up to another world, or put you down to a lower one, but most of all movies leave you asking questions. ""Is this real?"" ""Where are we going?"" ""What have we just done?"" ""What do I do now?!"" This is not a movie like that."|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight Howard is simply amazing in this show, he just oozes charisma . If you have not yet seen this movie please do yourself a favour and check it out. The only complaint I have about the movie is its length - I found myself getting bored after about 2/3rds but that could just be me being spoiled by so many other films on DVD. There are a couple of really good moments which don't take too long to get across.|0
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
"`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what the public is willing to give it. The movie starts off with one of those scenes where you think, ""This could happen."" I was shocked at how easy it was to make that happen. Well, in all honesty, I don't really care too much for this film. I've seen it twice. In fact, I may be the ONLY person who saw it two or more times."|0
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I was amazed to look at the movie and realize she was actually on the same screen as herself ! The concept of this film is good, however, its execution would have benefitted from better editing. Every time I see this movie it makes me think 'why did i watch that?'. There are times when the story becomes a little bit too confusing, particularly for the younger audience. The plot is fairly simple and doesn't take you out of the movie by much.|0
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original rock'n roll band , but to call them an old school group is quite an error. There's almost nothing to hold them back from being one of the biggest stars in pop entertainment history. If you haven't seen the series , you'll have a hard time getting through this movie . It's really a waste of time . It is difficult to think of a film that makes me feel this way when watching it, despite the fact that many of the things I was thinking were totally false.|0
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Ancic.Ancic's latest, in addition to having a lot of style, is also highly original. In addition to being a masterpiece of art cinema, it might also be one of the most significant films ever made about space flight. I loved this film, but I don't love space movies. When you have an amazing cast like Travolta and Keitel and fantastic set design and effects, well, you can't really fault them.|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast.The plot of the script was not bad. In fact it was pretty good. They could have at least written out a decent ending, as there were no cliff hangers. I really liked all the actors and how they handled themselves in the film. But the script was just too weak . A very low budget, poorly-written movie, with poor acting and awful dialog. The only redeeming quality of this movie is some of the special effects.|0
I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described it to a friend in an effort to avoid saying it ourselves. This movie is the worst thing I have ever seen. I don't even know why I watched it at this point. The acting is terrible, the story is awful, and the production values are just embarrassing. This movie would not have even been worth watching if Michael Caine's voice hadn't come on every five seconds. He gave absolutely nothing of himself here.|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to New World ( USA ) in order to escape an arranged marriage . The Golden Door is based on a true story about a family's struggle between their Italian roots and that of their new-found American identity. I thought I would try this movie since it was written by my wife, who liked it so much she had been recommending it to us. This movie didn't live up to her expectations. The only thing that was interesting was the plot.|0
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and Danny DeVito (Pulp Fiction), but it is not funny or clever in the least, especially when compared to their earlier work.DeNiro does an excellent job with his accent, as he attempts to make the best of a life that is quite different for him. Unfortunately, the story line doesn't hold up too well under scrutiny. Good news, I saw this movie before writing this review, so I don't feel obligated to rehash old grievances.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect Dad. This has to be the first movie I've ever seen in my life that made me want to have a mental breakdown. I'd say it had as much to do with the fact that I was having a very good day and there were a bunch of other people at the cinema enjoying their movies, but hey...I'm not complaining. The main issue with this movie is that it doesn't have a plot!|0
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster that takes all of us as viewers. This film has more twists and turns than a roller coaster ride, and it's made by someone who knows what they're talking about! The actors are believable, and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat--even with the occasional lull.The problem is that it's a pretty bad film. The acting is flat, the pacing is slow, and the plot is too convoluted.|0
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde to my attention .The actors in it were great , but the dialog was just terrible. I am sure you can guess by now what I had in mind... I must say that the original version of Frankenstein was a little dull, slow paced and quite predictable. There is one scene where a couple of scientists are discussing whether or not they should make a cure for the monster. The doctor's answer has an element of scientific certainty to it--it's too dangerous to try.|0
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a d√©j√† vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!! My God ! it is the best! and i can't stop watching it. I don't know what to say, I had high expectations but they were dashed on this movie. I am not one of those people that has to give a movie more than 2 stars. I always rate movies on their originality, creativity, and overall enjoyment. The movie doesn't quite fit in to either category.|0
"When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it on DVD. It turned out that it was being released in the USA under the title, ""Masters Of The World"" (I think). At that time, it had not yet come out in Italy so I got hold of my local Italian Video store and rented it. There are quite a few strange things going on in this movie. Not the least of which is the fact that one of the leading characters is an alien from Mars."|0
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a journey. Along the way, he runs into several characters along the way including a young girl called Lola (who he later finds out is his own sister). I didn't love this one at all because it just doesn't have anything special or memorable going for it. It's just bland, boring and dull. This movie made me want to take a knife and stab my head so bad that it might as well have been in the film itself.|0
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll find it. Well this is the biggest letdown ever. At no point did we get what we expected to be an interesting movie with decent acting. What a waste of time, I mean come on they could have at least put a decent story line in there. The worst part is why couldn't they give us some good looking women? They are supposed to be super hot but this movie looked like it was filmed on a school campus.|0
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it's not a typical comedy with a good cast. The story is very funny, about a woman who tries to win a divorce from her boyfriend. It's hard for me to explain why this movie was terrible. The script is awful. The acting and direction are just awful. What's even more amazing is that this movie made $4.5M worldwide on a budget of $30K. I cannot imagine how someone came up with a script so terrible and then allowed their production team to produce it.|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's. This film was based around the life of a small time crook who gets caught by the feds and sent to the big house where he meets his eventual fate. I've never understood the appeal of this kind of flick, and for that reason alone I'll probably never return to this film. It is just a waste of two hours of my life that I don't feel like paying back with money. There isn't really much going on here.|0
"I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself , it just seems wrong , when the people of Egypt are depicted as bad , stupid and evil ! And what about the women ? This is a very silly little movie, with nothing to add except the fact that the story was written by a former student of mine (the same guy who turned ""The Secret of Nimh""). What I found especially disappointing was that there was no effort made to show the characters from a more humanistic point of view."|0
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life . His main mode of communication is the bowler hat and glasses. I found him quite annoying at times, which might explain why I didn't like them as much as other reviews make it sound. Why would any person pay money for this ""movie"". You can look it up in your library and watch it for free on YouTube.The only reason that I watched this movie was because I knew that someone else had reviewed it. This movie is horrible."|0
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
"Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well. The story seems like it will be fun and funny at the start, but then turns into a depressing mess . I could see myself being sucked in for a few episodes, thinking ""What's up with the girl? Why doesn't she just tell her family to get out?"". This show is pathetic. Every time you want to laugh or enjoy something, its all about the characters. Its really hard to understand what they are thinking or doing."|0
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree it's not up to the level of the book but I would still like to see it because I am a huge fan of Stephen King. This was an atrocious movie. The acting was terrible, especially from Jennifer Jason Leigh (who had her first lead role in a long time and really needed to get off her butt and do more), as well as from Tom Selleck, although I guess they were trying their hardest.|0
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew having to battle a space ship from the future in order to keep Earth free of the Borgs. I've always hated this episode because I think it's very boring, and I also can't stand that they had to go into the future so often just to make some lame joke. I really don't know what to make of this show. It looks like it would be pretty enjoyable, and there seems to be a lot of money being invested in it.|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
"I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade with him ! I think we're all guilty of this one - when we see a really good film that is not in our immediate cinematic interests, we have the tendency to try and catch it on TV instead. We can't help but think: what if? What would happen if someone else took the same premise? Well, I'm pleased to admit that I watched ""Cave Dwellers"" without a hint of jealousy (perhaps due to the fact that I don't own a cable subscription)."|0
"Can the intensity of a husband 's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime , despite the obvious consequences to themselves or others? If so, how did this guy escape with his life? I got this movie after seeing ""Lethal Weapon 3"", and I am not sure how it could have possibly improved on such a great concept. There are several things in this movie that just absolutely do not work: 1) The first time I saw this movie (at a friend's suggestion), I thought it might be good. It was."|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had Lisa (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) being interviewed about her life story. She claims that she was raped by a man at the age of 7 when she and her mother got lost in a storm on the way back from the beach to visit relatives. As I mentioned earlier this episode is terrible, and it only gets worse. It's one of those episodes where you don't know why they were doing it until it's already over.|0
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause it is about a kid who has to stay in school to get a job as a bus boy . i found this film quite funny and thought its a good one to show kids. if you want to know what all the hype is about check it out! This movie might not be that bad at all. The script is fairly well-written and the plot does hold up reasonably well. I'm not going to say too much on this review since it's pretty much just an opinion.|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another. Theres just too much going on in this movie to fit in a single review so i did a quick write-up for those that want to read a short synopsis of what is about to be presented to the world . Why? Why? Why? Where's the love? Where's the emotion? We're supposed to feel something while watching this film, or we won't be able to make any decisions about how to spend our time.|0
"I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there was nothing in it that could not be done in one hour with an A.D.V.R. (Airborne TV Video) . The story line and dialogue was good, but the writing and production values were pretty awful. I didn't get the impression from the show that it was made by professionals. I am hoping someone will post a better quality tape of the show online. When I read the title of this piece I thought ""oh no""."|0
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is fun to watch . I have heard some people who don't like the movie , but i can assure you it is not because of this reason. The first time I saw this film was when I was six or seven and we were watching movies at night on a rainy night in an Italian apartment. My mother had recently gotten married, my father wasn't around, and all we had was that one piece of pizza from Pizza Hut and some popcorn.|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
"Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot of experience with men . She is very attracted to Owen Wilson
This was one of my least favourite movies, in fact I never went to see it. I've actually heard people calling it the worst movie they've ever seen, but I don't believe them because it's pretty awful.The script isn't that bad at all, as it has some interesting things in it. But the whole thing is so contrived and contrived it just drags along."|0
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) as an all around thug who uses his fists to settle his personal problems. He has no respect or sympathy for women, children, and anyone else not ""in his place"".This is a rather odd film to make. It's obviously meant to be a comedy, but it doesn't have a lot of wit in it. ""Black Power"" was made in 1973, and released into theatres that same year."|0
"Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a beautiful young woman who was his lover's fianc√©e. This violent act shocked us all, especially me. It took me a few weeks to understand that the movie I just saw was not about a real life event or even about a real life person (though it is obviously based on true events).I'm a huge fan of The Sopranos but never once did I expect to be watching an ""Sopranos"" spoof."|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage. A good example of this is when Johnny Cash was interviewed before a gig in London. After seeing this film, I had to re-watch all my favourite '80s TV series for inspiration because they were so clearly based on this film's plot line. It is an absolute travesty that anyone thought this could be done justice. To make matters worse, it did not come close to accurately capturing how bad this film was.There is no excuse for what this film has done to these shows.|0
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , in terms of atmosphere and characters, its also one of my favorite movies to be shown to people who dont' speak Italian. This movie has a very low budget making it look like it was done at an extremely low-budget indie film studio but the effects are awesome. The movie features a duckling on the run being hunted by a group of humans. As you can imagine from looking at this website, I'm quite a fan of all things sci-fi/fantasy.|0
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that they just shot the movie like a reality show, with the actors portraying the opposite of real people. Wow, this movie isn't very good. I didn't really expect much after watching so many bad movies but it's just plain bad. Even the title doesn't do it justice. The story sounds like something from a cheesy B-movies. You don't think about anything because the movie keeps trying to convince you that everything in it is important.|0
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There were lots of references to movies that aren't very good . I am sure you can find more out on the net. If you haven't seen this flick before, be prepared to feel a bit stupid. It's about a high school nerd who wants to play football for the big time. The problem is he doesn't fit the physical type. He has small hands and isn't built for contact. The coaches don't want him at linebacker because he can't run fast enough.|0
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , they are very brief and don't do the story justice. I was disappointed to discover that most people have not seen this film. That said, I'm happy to say that after reading some of the negative reviews I've seen it is worth a watch if you enjoy horror films with a lot of blood and gore. I am not one of those people. I enjoyed watching it as much as other people.|0
"I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect, but this show was horrible! The only good part in this movie that i can remember was when it was just the cast and some friends. House of Wax is one of those ""scary"" movies where you have to look away or else you will be dead before you finish the movie. This particular film was not scary at all for me and I watched it with two friends because we were trying to scare each other out of boredom."|0
"It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY musical theater scene of the sixties and seventies.The actors are uniformly good.I really like the music, especially the first few minutes of ""Paddy's Pub"" . But I just can't get into this movie after the first 20 minutes. This is a movie about two men whose love has been tested by a terrible tragedy. They travel to Europe to find out what happened, only to find that the woman who died was the daughter of a very influential person in the area."|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
"I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It's sad to see them go.. It's not often a movie can bring out two reactions in people: ""OMG this movie was so awful, I can't believe someone actually made this,"" and ""Hey! That's how you make an interesting movie?"" Unfortunately, that is exactly what happens on this movie. Let's start from the beginning: there is absolutely no sense of where the story is supposed to go."|0
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem to the American dream, set in the mid-1920s at a fictional resort town called Golden Door. It's a place that seems to be populated exclusively by hard-bitten working women, who make good money for their trouble. I think I might have bought a copy of this movie on sale just so that I'd have something to add to the discussions about what it's like to actually work in the film industry.|0
"Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz did well with her role. If you ever want to see a film that has nothing to do with cinema go check out ""A Christmas Carol"". This movie is an attempt to bring the characters of Christmas Carol into a modern day setting. The only redeeming qualities are the cast, all of whom seemed to have done little more than stand around and laugh their asses off.I saw this movie after watching a friend who had seen it watch ""A Christmas Carol""."|0
This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as having a boy pretend to be a man so his teacher won't think he is gay. I had been looking forward to this movie for almost a whole year and now I wish I never did. The characters are flat, the dialog is all over-the-line and the plot is incredibly boring. In fact it seems to be the director's way of getting attention from the other distributors out there that don't have any idea about what movies they are distributing.|0
I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a movie theatre is stupid, period. Somebody tell us what's the problem? Is this really a comedy? I mean, it certainly isn't good but it's funny as hell. It has nothing to do with sex. No matter how hard I try to put my foot down and point out all the holes in these characters, I don't think I'll be heard. It's very easy to find humour in situations when you have no emotional involvement.|0
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I thought it was a little too long , but at least it showed some character development .The acting in the movie was just good enough to make you enjoy it . If anyone has not seen this movie yet then here's a hint. It does not resemble the book at all. Yes, it has the same title, but if you go and buy the book you'll see that it doesn't have much in common with the film.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
"This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot and falling into water . Lots of explosions and lots of destruction . There's not a single boring moment in this movie . If you've ever heard someone talking about the first Star Wars, this is what you should do ! My god. I'm embarrassed to be called a ""fan."" When it comes down to it, all I really have been doing for the last twenty years is watching bad movies. I don't care what anyone else has to say as long as they're entertaining."|0
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I knew she would be a good choice for this film, but what a pleasant surprise! She brought something truly unique to the project that was very refreshing. She and her co-star James Woods were able to come across as characters who were actually interested in the script; they seemed genuinely excited to do the film. Even though neither of them had quite enough screen time to really sink their teeth into any one part of the story, I thought it was well done.|0
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was a kid, so I can't comment on how it is today. I've seen the original and it was pretty poor. But this re-release looks like a new movie made by someone who really doesn't understand why people like his movies. It's almost as though they took the old one and added an extra hour or two to make it look good.I don't want to give away too many spoilers, so if you haven't seen it yet, please go see it!|0
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic lines. There is no place on Earth this film could have been set anywhere in the US except Los Angeles. I'm just a normal guy, with average looks, a job, a house and family, I live in a nice suburb but my wife has two kids and i don't want any of them going to war. As soon as i saw this flick i instantly wanted to get my kid out of there right away and buy him a ticket to Europe or the US.|0
"In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a city street when they encounter two men. Luca picks up a pistol and tells the men to drop it. While he's distracted, the other man lunges at Luca and shoots him in the side. This movie does have some good points. The story is interesting and not too dissimilar to that of ""Pray for the Wicked"" although it doesn't seem quite as grim. I would recommend this to fans of horror, thriller, or any genre you could think of."|0
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe Jo√£o Falc√£o has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falc√£o has been influenced by the series ""Hoje √© Dia De Maria""."|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
"This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for the first time that I have ever seen in my life. ""Holly's"" career can be characterized by three distinct phases: 1. A very brief period in which he was quite popular and successful, 2. The so-called ""Bad Years"" from about 1957-1960, 3. The ""Lively Years"" between 1960-1967. During this time Buddy managed to make only a couple of decent albums but never managed to attain the fame and fortune he might have received had his music been marketed more effectively."|0
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
"the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid could have made this film. This movie is awful! The whole movie has no plot. We get to see one or two of the people involved in a horrible accident. There is not even a clue about who the main character is. Why? Who knows. It would be fun to watch a movie like this, but the only reason it was created is because people were bored with the last ""Tales From the Darkside"" movie.It starts out with a man and woman playing poker."|0
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and the landscape there, it was truly breathtaking . The only thing I didn't like so much was the acting , the actors all did their best but there were many moments where they showed a lack of focus , which I found very annoying.I recommend watching this movie if you know nothing about Greece or are not fond of melodrama . You will be able to see the beautiful country at its finest . The movie begins with a description of the island of Corfu.|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan , with Robert De Niro as Jimmy Dolan and Diane Lane as Sally. This movie is so bad I'm embarrassed to admit I've seen it once or twice. The plot involves two men who live in different cities, but the only contact each other has is through e-mails. It's almost laughable. You get the sense that these two characters can't stand each other, and their relationship is based entirely on mutual contempt.There's no suspense, no drama, and absolutely no humor.|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful film. It's a tribute to those who have lost too soon and to those with no life anymore. I love this film. I really do. Its an extremely sad movie but it is very true. The main characters are very much like me (I'm 24 y/o straight male and i have never been as close to a complete outcast). As a child, I was absolutely terrified of anyone other than my parents.|0
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . The whole thing is just a big boring joke, but it's not as bad as it looks. There are a couple of good gags along the way. The writing is pretty bad, which isn't surprising considering this movie was produced by Disney. This is a film that would be very hard to find under the radar. If you're a horror fan, or have seen some of the horror flicks of the last 20 years, then you'll probably like this film.|0
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
"`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of admission alone . It isn't really a movie at all and I don't see why anyone who has seen it would even bother with any of the following:
It took me years to come around to this film but once I did, I was completely blown away. If you love movies that aren't just about cars, trucks, bikes, planes, etc, you will probably be entertained by this one."|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and I happened to catch a bit of this show while on a trip. It caught my attention very early on. I thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. When I got home, I started watching all the episodes again and it still holds up. It's not just good comedy, it's pretty darn funny even when it doesn't make any sense. There are times when it makes total sense and some other times it doesn't...at least they try.|0
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put any doubters to shame - if they don't give up in the middle. I think it was written by one of those people who really have no sense of humour. The film opens with an almost comical accident at the hands of two police detectives. One falls down a flight of stairs (I'm sure you've already seen that one). When they search his jacket, they find a piece of paper that reads 'Wanted' and a picture of a naked woman.|0
"I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . What a waste of time . The story is laughable . This is an unfortunate film. I know that it's being touted as a ""biopic"", but it's not even remotely like a biopic. Instead it's a melodrama about a group of African-Americans in Chicago in the 1920s. It tries to pass itself off as an exploration of race relations; it certainly isn't. The plot focuses on one man's rise through the social, political and economic ladder."|0
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be a very intriguing movie with lots of action, suspense, and some decent acting. But sadly, this movie has no redeeming value whatsoever. I've already mentioned that I didn't understand what the characters were trying to accomplish. The story was dull and predictable. The acting was amateur at best. There weren't enough twists and turns to keep viewers engaged. A lot of actors could have done a better job since they were not given enough time to develop themselves as characters.|0
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's had a lot of interesting plot twists and turns... This movie is totally insane. It starts off so slow that I couldnt even find my way home. After about 2 1/2 hours, there are no more action scenes left. All the characters are dead except for the cop. I felt like I'm watching a rerun of a terrible television show. The violence is almost laughable in comparison to the great movies on cable channels.|0
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) at home, young Jean Valjean's (Gael Garcia Bernal ) life takes a dramatic turn. As he fights his way to freedom and away from the sinister Duvalier, he comes into contact with an array of people who will be key players in his eventual redemption. Jean Valjean is one of the more entertaining actors I've seen in a year or so. His performance is not perfect, but that's part of the charm. It isn't always pretty, but it isn't usually awful.|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an abusive couple, in a film that was basically a sequel to ""Vacation"" -- is never really explained. I am not saying that the movie wasn't well acted...it sure was. But what could have been done to make this movie better? As a huge fan of Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz, I saw this as an easy target. After reading all the reviews I decided to give it a shot. Well, at first it seemed like a great movie."|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and not really for those who are anti-government, I thought it did a good job of highlighting the lack of governmental accountability. If you were looking for an entertainment film that was light on plot but heavy on characters and suspense - look elsewhere. It's not a very exciting movie. But if you're looking for great acting, stunning special effects, and some truly tense scenes...then this is for you.The story is basic and predictable.|0
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
"I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it first came out , I was very disappointed with it , I think they made the most of a poor script and did what they could to sell it . If you are a fan of horror films this one is worth checking out , if not get some popcorn and maybe an old copy of ""Scream"" or ""House of Wax"". I am a lover of scary movies. I can remember watching Carrie (Carrie) and reading all the gore/scary/mystery novels I could get my hands on."|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written and directed by David O'Connor (who also wrote the movie's score), who has some nice moments. But there is a fundamental problem, which can only be explained by looking at the novel in light of its sequels. I thought this was kind of funny but I have to say that this film is absolutely terrible!!! The characters are so stupid and you can't figure out anything that is going on. There is no humor in the film at all.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Field ) who grows up to be a very beautiful woman. One day, while visiting her Aunt Elsa ( Margarete Heu) she meets Hans Gruber ( Jorgen Odenholtz ) , an evil man with a dark past. They become fast friends but soon they fall in love. At the end of the film, when the bad guy has finally been killed, it looks as if everything is over for the good guys. Not so!|0
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have the power to make people disappear. I don't understand how this show has lasted for 22 years. If you watch it with a kid under 12 or your wife, you are more likely to go crazy. The story lines are completely absurd and all the actors act like kids. It seems like it was made in the '50s or earlier. I can't figure out what the purpose of this show is. There's no plot, no mystery, just bad acting, poor direction and dumb jokes.|0
"Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story was based on wrote a very bad book called ""Punk"" that I bought at the local Blockbuster back in 1993. I didn't enjoy it, and so I turned it into a comic instead. So far, I like the comic more than the book. If you love books, then this probably isn't the book for you. There's nothing wrong with this movie. You don't need to watch it if you're not interested in seeing people getting killed."|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of the people who work on this film company and am very familiar with how they work , so I could not possibly have seen it as anything other than an insult to all that are still living in the real world.I'm not trying to judge this film too harshly because it is a documentary , but I can't help but call it out for being full of lies and misinformation. All of the people quoted in the movie are dead and there is absolutely nothing written about their lives at all .|0
"1930 's comedy mystery about `` The Crooked Circle '' a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder and robbery of an innocent woman in their neighborhood. What they don't realize, however, is that she isn't who she seems to be; she's part of an underground religion that worships a female devil. (This movie, unlike many others in this category, is not very good)
I really didn't know what to expect from this flick. I love the horror genre and usually enjoy movies with strange plots and interesting characters. This one was different though."|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is so obvious , that it has gone over people's heads (they are not even trying here). But the whole show is so dull, I found myself bored almost immediately after getting through only a few seconds of it. There are so many scenes and sub plots going on that it's impossible to keep tabs on all of them, and no one ever does anything except sit around and stare at the ground as they talk.|0
"These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop star's attempt to find fame and fortune in the form of being cast in a TV sitcom and 2) The use of children who are either naive, gullible or both. However, ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" is different from many of its forebears in this respect. This comedy about a middle-age man who can't find love or fulfillment in any meaningful way makes me cringe so much I sometimes have trouble breathing."|0
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which is not surprising to me. I think it just didn't fit with the movie, that's about it. My favorite parts are the first 5 mins of the movie when everything goes right, and the scenes in the hotel/lodging. The acting is great, though. I would have loved to have heard from Mr. Egan or his son if there was going to be a sequel. What an utter waste of time and money.|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really excited. The film had the potential to be quite great if done well - and boy did it not deliver. I've seen a lot of awful films in my day, but this one tops the list. The acting is so bad it's almost funny. Most of the leading men look more like they were ripped from a magazine than they do actors. Every scene seems to play out with one actor talking while another character looks on, looking uncomfortable.|0
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well M√ºllers B√ºro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need to be very open minded if you want a good laugh.. it takes a LOT of imagination. The reason why we laugh in movies is because there is a good story behind it . This movie did NOT deserve a 10! Why would anyone bother wasting an entire afternoon on this trash? It starts out really bad, but I could care less about the plot (which was pretty terrible in the first place).|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting ¬†journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an ¬†astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could ever want. It's a crime that such a brilliant film has to be so badly managed in order for the director to pay his bills. The actors are very talented and can really deliver their roles well. I guess some might complain that they couldn't afford an Oscar-winning cinematographer like James Wong Howe but he certainly did a superb job here. So, we need to watch this movie now? No way! What if you have just had a heart attack?|0
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns, girls, sex and violence ! What more can you ask for? When I see this movie, I just think that they could have made it a little better! It starts off great...but then it's over too quickly and the movie loses steam. There are so many plot holes that don't get mentioned until the very end and no one bothers explaining them.I don't care what anyone says, this movie shouldn't be in the top 50 of all time list.|0
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother and Me set on that one at my local Wal-Mart ), there is a lot of potential for great movies to make themselves available in this format. I just had to write a review of this horrible movie. I can not begin to imagine how anyone could watch this film and enjoy it. It starts off OK, with good acting and plot lines. But once the script becomes more and more nonsensical, the story completely falls apart. There is no point to the movie.|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant ride to what is now a TV classic. When I saw it on the cable channels, I knew it was time to get it off the shelves. But then I saw it on DVD and was shocked at the awful quality. There are only five scenes of the whole show left in the DVD and one of them doesn't make sense to me.I think that's enough from me. The show is just so bad that there is no point in telling you why.|0
"When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who seems as if he is trying to get away from his past by going into showbiz is at best annoying and at worst annoying in the most painful way. He is a complete waste of money, but that doesn't save him from showing up in scenes that make you wonder if he is still around. Well, I don't want to be rude, but ""Madame'' is just plain terrible. It took about 5 minutes of viewing to realize what kind of movie this really is."|0
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a wheelchair? As it turns out, no one, not even the actors. I bought this movie just because I like to see how bad actors are compared to their real life counterparts on IMDb. To my surprise, the only way they can compare themselves with their real life counterparts is that they take horrible acting lessons. What's more, the script was awful. The characters were extremely shallow and didn't have depth. There was very little dialogue and most of it was completely useless.|0
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
"Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was the original ""Sharktopus"" that I rented from VHS at a garage sale, and I just can't bring myself to watch this. It is just so much better than the actual film, it almost gives me the shakes. The special effects are laughable, the storyline is lame, etc. There is one scene where there are sharks swimming past in a boat, and they swim right next to the kids, who are riding on the back deck of the boat."|0
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) was so good that he is still remembered today. I can't help but feel like I'm sitting at home in my living room watching this film on repeat. It may not have been quite the masterpieces of the French New Wave, but for a 90 minute movie, it sure has a lot more than one. The plot is fairly simple: a woman leaves her wealthy husband and heads to Los Angeles. Her son finds her and decides to take her under his wings.|0
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (as the cast of MASH might have been in the latter) and then you won't mind too much if your expectations are knocked down slightly. I will start by stating that this is the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. The premise itself is a great idea. There is a mysterious desert island, where the only people left on earth are some scientists from the past. And one of those scientists goes back to live among the natives for reasons which are not made clear.|0
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to it, I was not a big fan of it so I won't comment. I watched this film based purely on the premise (in my humble opinion) that ""if there's anything more depressing than being a middle-aged guy who can't seem to find anyone to hang out with at night, let me know and I'll come over and make you some tea."" But what could possibly be more depressing than watching people you don't even really know trying to kill each other for no apparent purpose?"|0
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
"The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman's, and with a lot more character development. (But still without any actual magic!) I really liked this film but I must say that it isn't perfect. First of all there was absolutely nothing magical in this story. It could be described as a ""happy ending."" The movie seems to be trying to make up for its lack by adding in a lot of extra stuff. One of these extras would be the relationship between the two lovers."|0
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper , a young gangster who gets into more trouble than he bargained for when he kidnaps two teenage girls and takes one of them to Las Vegas. The film is riddled with all types of clich√©s involving drug dealing, guns, prostitution and gambling. I thought this film would have been a better movie if they hadn't tried to pass it off as a comedy. What a waste of a talented cast and crew.|0
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of my favorites ! I can only imagine what a pain it must have been for her to sit through all of these boring scenes. If she didn't have a really strong stomach, she couldn't have sat through this movie. I mean, come on, when you watch it again and again, you will find nothing new.The dialogue is so predictable; it's as if the director/writer didn't even read the script before shooting. The performances are average at best and not memorable either.|0
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully written drama about a terminally ill young man, who finds comfort and hope in a religious sect. This film has a lot going for it, however, I think that part of the reason for its success lies in the fact that it portrays a very believable world. The story was interesting, though I felt that there needed to be more backstory. There were some moments that I thought were rather forced, which didn't really enhance the film's effect.|0
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . It's amazing how much time, energy and money the filmmakers put into making that film. There are literally hundreds of tiny little plot holes, poor performances, awful effects, cliches and bad writing. Don't think for one second that it's any more fun than the movies from the 70's or 80's - just because it looks better. There are so many bad movies made today. This one falls in my top 5.|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . It's a good movie, but the director obviously made a big mess of it -- and not just on the set.For one thing, his script was bad. I thought that he had done a very good job of building the story from the inside out. But as it turns out, all of the character development takes place by the end of Act II. A few years ago, I was introduced to The Black Dahlia.|0
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so rich and likable . I will watch this film again and again because of all it has to offer . I can't make a decent joke about this movie's plot. What the hell is going on? There are only two possible explanations. One is that the people involved in making this made it up, then realized that it was an absolute piece of crap after it came out. The other explanation is that the entire production team was simply high or drunk when they were working on it.|0
Years ago I read the book ' A M√°quina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little book I realized that it was a very clever and well written book.The only problem is that there seems to be no connection at all with this movie. This film may have been made for $40m, but one thing is for sure - it was poorly made.I'm an avid horror fan and have watched quite a lot of movies since I was a kid. I've had great enjoyment out of just about anything that comes across my screen.|0
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed my attention and I just had to see if the rest of the cast were good or not. I was happy to say that the rest of the cast were quite good but the acting was very bad. The story line did not do the movie any favours . It could have been set in a much better place to be taken seriously although it may have been too easy for them to get away with it ! You're looking for a classic? There's something for you!|0
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a prolific painter. In fact, I am sure that this man had more paintings than any of us will have in our lifetimes, so I would like you to watch them. The most disgusting thing I've seen in a long time. I'm sorry but people like this make me sick. The acting was not very good. Maybe it was due to the actors' accents or maybe they just couldn't do anything other than sit there and stare.|0
"Dr. Paul Flanner ( Richard Gere ) , a successful surgeon , has his wife leave him , his son is molested by a neighbor and in the process of going through puberty , he begins wearing women's clothes, thinking it is ""the man thing"" to do. The plot was not original. It had the same basic idea that so many movies use: people go to a country where there are lots of wild animals and have an adventure with them. However this time it wasn't all fun and games either."|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently doesn't quite understand the basic principle that it's better to leave people guessing than to tell them directly . I didn't buy this movie at first, but after watching it for 2-3 hours I realized it is not what I expected. The characters are very shallow and without any depth, there is no plot, no development whatsoever. I feel sorry for the people who put their money towards this film. Maybe they will have a great time if they do a DVD release....|0
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . The story line has some nice moments that make it all worthwhile. It's amazing to see how bad a scriptwriter could turn out a movie. You would think that if they were trying to be as accurate as possible, the script would at least be good. But after watching this stupid flick I can't help but feel sorry for the actors. They all seem to want to be the hero in every scene they're in.I thought I was watching a real war movie when I first started this movie.|0
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 movie for me now. Great acting, great story and great editing.I can see that it has received more attention from film critics than most of their films but i am sure many other people would agree. There seems to be no good reason not to give this film a 10 because there are only 4 negative comments on IMDb. Some say it looks like it was filmed in Italy. Others say the acting is stiff.|0
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes place on a desert island , and there are several things about it you should know. 1- The film opens with a scene depicting a man walking along the beach. He's talking to a woman, and he walks past her. She turns round to look at him and she says 'Why don't you ask her yourself?' (I think this was used as a reference to how women act around me when I talk to them in real life).|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens √∂ really do not do it justice . I read the original book by R.L. Stine at age 7 and fell in love with it from that moment until now. I would say this is a better sequel than the original one. So much so that I even bought the movie for my brother, who didn't like the novel. He told me that he wanted to see how the story ends. When I first saw this film, I thought its premise was genius but then I realized that they were just throwing ideas around.|0
"Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . So far, my opinion is that the only good thing about it so far has been the excellent soundtrack. The acting was terrible, the directing was horrible, the editing was awful. I cannot recommend this movie. I would like to tell you how the actors are ""bad"" because I know some of them were on TV and I just can't stand that. The acting was bad enough that I never watched it."|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce shows that are entertaining and informative but not necessarily worth watching (especially if you don't live in the target audience). The series, however, does have a good plot, some pretty good acting, and plenty of great music. However, one thing I really did not like about this show was the use of very short flashbacks. It would take too long to explain something that happened in the past or what has just happened with no real explanation.|0
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
"While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed at teenage boys, who are looking to relive the glory of their high school years, a period of great social and cultural upheaval. First of all, let me say that I think this film is an abysmal piece of nonsense. I was expecting something more like ""High School High"" but this is pretty much the opposite. What it does have is a group of mostly male teens who don't know how to act around girls, they only do stupid things and then blame it on someone else."|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place on the IMDb all-time cult-film list, alongside John Waters. He has also made such horror classics as ""Blood Alley"" and ""Vampire Lestat"". The only redeeming aspect to this piece of crummy garbage was the fact that it could have been done by a better filmmaker. When you look at the set design (which I can't recall seeing before), there was nothing in it to suggest anything other than the film being a parody of Italian horror cinema."|0
"Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded to the ground by the fact that all this is being made by a man who has never set foot on any Indian soil.I'm sorry but I found myself wondering ""What do they get up to down here? They've left their own country behind?!"" If I had not seen the film before, I might have assumed this was the work of one of the 'Big Four' in Hindi cinema. After seeing the first five minutes, I should have expected nothing less."|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II was going to be something different, but alas it was just plain predictable. For starters, the plot is simply that the Nazis have landed on the island and are trying to wipe out the Greeks so they can then conquer the entire Middle East (which isn't happening). They've got all sorts of crazy Nazi weapons which they decide to take with them for some reason.The main cast is very dull.|0
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so I was happy to give this a shot. He loved it, and when we watched it for the first time in about 8 months, I felt very guilty that he had to wait another month before watching it again because I forgot to record it while I was with him.The characters are well thought out and acted, though none of the actors seem to be able to really bring much to the role. The voice acting is terrible, and there's little variety from one character to the next.|0
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do serious acting without being cheesy . The plot is predictable , and the ending is anticlimactic . The premise of this movie is so stupid that I can't even think of it as something that could be remotely entertaining. Why would anyone have to pay someone to kidnap children? What kind of a person would want to kidnap an infant for ransom? And if kidnappers kidnapped babies for money, what kind of people are they? This was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen.|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about a group of people who worked as a cult and that it wasn't for the squeamish . It turned out to have none of the charm or originality of some of the movies I have seen. The film is nothing more than a reenactment of a couple of years of the lives of those involved in the group. The acting is so bad that you begin to wonder if the actors even knew how to speak English.|0
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. I must have been 12 or 13. I think that at the time my father had a copy of this on video and we watched it together. It was a fairly average horror film. The acting was pretty good but nothing spectacular. I'm not even sure who played the lead, but he wasn't bad either. The story is quite simple - a family move into a modest suburban home. Things start going awry with strange sounds coming from the basement one night.|0
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema ¬ñ a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this movie online, so when I finally got a chance to see it, I couldn't help but be disappointed by what I saw . This is one of those films where if you don't watch it with your parents, you might find it mildly disturbing. The story is simple enough, there's an old house that has been abandoned since the early 20th century and its contents are kept in various drawers and boxes.|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce , Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman 's remote hometown of St. Cloud, Minnesota for a romantic getaway. I am so tired of people who think they know the movie industry when they have never been in it. The movie industry has come a long way but it isn't perfect. Let's start with how this one starts. A man calls his girlfriend and she says she'll see him soon. Then there is an old man who gives the man a ride.|0
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
"Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you might like her. But she did not come across well in the book. The only thing that made me happy was that we were finally shown the side of her as a person.I felt sorry for her being so naive and innocent, but I don't want to spoil it for myself by saying more . I watched this movie with the expectation of watching someone else do an ""American Made"". However, I couldn't help feeling disappointed."|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or sense of responsibility ! The characters were pathetic, the acting pitiful, and the story contrived. It was one of those movies that could have been much better if it had more time to grow on you. It starts out quite good, but soon the plot is dragged out way too much. I'm sure there are many other critics who disagree with me on this. Some people will like it, others may find it boring.|0
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in 1950's Sicily during the Italian Civil War. The story starts off with a college student trying to figure out how to make some money, but finds that there are many ways to do that without using his brain. First, he has to have sex, which he does by shooting and killing someone. Next he decides to steal a motorbike, which involves finding a victim (who just happens to be a famous actor) and then kidnapping him and dragging him across town to kill him.|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in this country when slavery was being conducted. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a strong stomach. It's not just a movie but it's an eye opener. My wife and I wanted to take a break from watching too many bad movies on TV, and decided to rent this one.I really can't say what we thought about it. I thought it looked like a cheap knock off of The Shawshank Redemption (of course, I'm biased here).|0
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
"This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who goes after the mobster that's been responsible for the murder of several people. The problem, however, is that the movie never really finds its groove, and only gets more confusing with each viewing. I must say that I had very high hopes for ""Kill the Irishman"". It seems to have gotten a lot of hype by being made into a big budget Hollywood blockbusting movie (which I applaud), but I thought it could actually be a pretty good movie."|0
"Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos since. It's no wonder, as in this role he takes on some of the most memorable characters from the ""Boris Karloff vs. Dracula"" film! A great idea that fell flat. The premise is brilliant, but there are too many unanswered questions and too many plot holes for one movie. This was my first horror movie and I was shocked at how much gore it contained (which was actually quite tame by the standards of today's movies)."|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers being locked in a motel, and how their situation could be resolved when they encounter each other. When I first saw the ad for this movie, I thought it sounded really fun. I'm glad I checked it out.I guess it's just too bad that I didn't get to see the rest of the cast before I made up my mind. This is possibly the worst horror film ever made. And I've seen some of them.|0
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values are all superb. This movie has a great ending (I can't believe I'm saying this). One reviewer said he saw the end in about 5 mins and it wasn't that close to it. It was interesting to watch this movie. The premise was somewhat interesting, but after watching it I am left with a question: Why didn't they tell the director that it would be so easy to get these kinds of scenes in a normal movie?|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
"i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , with no drama . I really don't know why I've always hated this film, it is so awful in every possible way. First, let's start with the casting. They have actors who are obviously over-aged and can act at only high school level. There is one girl in particular whose face has turned into a pile of freckles. This is especially apparent when she goes into a classroom full of pre-teen boys and yells, ""STUPID LITTLE BOYS YOU WILL NEVER EVER UNDERSTAND MY SHEPHERD RIDE."""|0
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I don't remember what happened when they left the room. But it definitely wasn't funny at all . This one seemed to have more substance . Well, this movie didn't really seem like it had any sort of purpose other than to see how many stars could make a movie for $10 and a few days of rehearsal. That is NOTHING compared to the actual film production company, which put out a truly terrible film in the first place. The writing was absolutely awful.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
"Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how many times she can say ""I love your wife"" before it's replaced with, ""Why are you married? You mustn't hate your wife."" Also, I'm guessing that the other female roles were written by a woman. This movie made no sense to me! And I didn't even care if there were any vampires in it. I kept wanting to turn the TV off and go back to sleep."|0
OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . It starts out slow, and then ramps up to ridiculous levels . At first I found the acting good, but after about 2 hours I started to lose interest... This film has everything that is wrong in cinema. The characters are all over the place, the story is confusing, the soundtrack is either awful or completely irrelevant, the effects are very weak (I can't think of a single scene where someone looks like they've taken an electric saw to their body).|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it and they would come over to watch. Now I see they don't really love it anymore. This show isn't funny, not in my opinion, it's just plain un-funny with an extremely generic storyline. The story is very simple. The main characters are trying to kill their nemesis but they can't as he has too many followers. They try all different ways to defeat him but by the end of the show one of the characters ends up dead.|0
I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film and I thought it was great to look back on a movie when I had just been through it. I think that this movie is not well suited for children. It is full of gross sex scenes, nudity, violence, sexual innuendoes, and crude humor. To top it off, the characters have absolutely nothing to do with anything in the movie. They never discuss anything except what they see or hear or smell. The only character who gets a plot development involves his girlfriend's sister.|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . The only problem is the acting is a little stiff . I would not recommend watching this film because it takes itself so serious . Why do you spend $20 or more on this nonsense? It's nothing but a complete train wreck. Not only are there NO good scenes in here, but the plot is just plain silly as well. For instance, where does the money for the trip come from? What is going to happen to all the characters?|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific characters, as his films often do. I was particularly shocked by some of the child abuse scenes - I've never seen anything so sick in my life! There's also a lot of sex (though there is very little) and violence - which is quite gratuitous, considering how graphic the gore scenes are. I watched this on TV last night, because I can not stand horror movies anymore. They have all too often been replaced with slapstick comedies that are no longer scary even for kids.|0
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - all done in a very pleasant and easy to understand style. Well I went into this film with high expectations. When I first saw the trailer for this flick I was pretty excited. I thought what could be better than the classic World War II epic 'Valkyrie'? After seeing the picture I thought it was gonna be one of those films where we see a guy on horseback ride into battle and save the day. Wrong. This movie was not that good.|0
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without equal in the realm of self-parody. After watching the first two episodes of this show, I have to say my expectations for it were a little too high. After watching the first episode, I found myself wondering why this show even existed. It's not just that the characters are poorly developed, they don't seem to be living out any life whatsoever. Every character has a single flaw that is immediately apparent and yet everyone keeps on going about their daily lives anyway.|0
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
