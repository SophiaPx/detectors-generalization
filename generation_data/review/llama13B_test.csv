Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce, direct, finance and/or star in their own films who might otherwise not have been able to? Is that a good thing? This film does not answer the latter question either way, but it does appear that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With. Like most new producers/directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece heaves a heavily more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is primarily known for (Curb).|1
"So it's not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly? ""The Villain"" and this one could top the list.My husband says that ""Jekyll and Hyde Together Again"" is one of those movies that if ""you've been there and done that"" you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; hospitals, plastic surgery, Howard Hughes.... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate."|1
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining. It provides updates of tech news, video games pretty much everything geek. They are also the official broadcasters of E3 and Comiccon. If you are a geek, gamers or anything really, you will enjoy this show. They have definitely upped their game since the guy below me's review (2006). It's the only place that I get my tech info. Kevin Pereira and Olivia Munn work beautifully with each other and the show always has segments referring to things in the game, movie, comic... Universe.|1
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good.|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all: ""Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I'm a huge fan of 70's and 80's slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There's the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror."|1
`` Blind Spot '' one of my festival favorites . I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers coming together for one night and each with their own agenda . The film is very well cast and the directing and pacing of the film kept me riveted to my seat . It is one of those films where the characters are so well written and so well directed , you don't know which character is the bad guy till the very end . I loved it and would not be surprised to see it nominated for the Oscars in the future .|0
Containing Billy's famous humor, this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure, pleasantly unexpectedly so for Billy Crystal. This movie has different tear-jerker, dramatic, serious underlying themes (particularly with a scene with Steven Seagal). This movie was both entertaining and serious, a movie about lost love, about relationships with father-son, husband-wife, about friendship and values with a good dose of humor thrown in, especially at the beginning. The balance between drama and comedy isn't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type, but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid.|1
Even after nearly 20 years apart , the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing . In fact , the chemistry is stronger than ever before . Their last tour with Heaven and Hell was a great success and the band seemed to gain more and more fans every stop . Now that they’ve been on the road again for two years , it’s no wonder that the shows have gotten even better . When the band returned home from their Ozzfest dates last fall , they recorded their first live album in many , many years and now it has finally been released .|0
"This is a well directed Columbo episode , with also some good character but the story just does n't really work , the culprit just did n't made sense and also there was an important plot element that just don 't make any sense at all . This is really the only bad episode in the 3rd season
The plot of this episode is simply bizarre, and so much of it can't even be explained. It doesn't seem to be made clear when and if the car that was blown up was actually used as the murder weapon."|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.T Dutchess and the kittens love music.They have to practice the piano everyday.But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens he tries to make them sleep. But he fails. Them Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into song. With the song everybody wants to be a cat. Thomas gets to love music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other.I loved this movie and i like the cats to!|1
"Pity the Monkees . People always accused them of being manufactured ( which they were ) or being nothing more than pretty boys who played the guitar ( well, yes, some of the time ) . But as you can tell by this album , they had some great music inside them. ""Different"" is the best word to describe the album, but not in the negative way it's normally used . This is a good thing . The songs on ""Changes"" really were different , in a positive , good way. There wasn't really any songs on here that could be considered fillers ."|0
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in the days of apartheid. It shows how this hate was contrived and was groomed from generation to generation. Jan Ellis was taught that a black man was a plague. He was raised to be that way. Then he meets a man who is on the opposite side of his beliefs, Pastor Lekota. will he change his ways?. The film is a powerful movie that shows the perceptions the different races had for one another, it shows these perceptions with quite a lot of accuracy.|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby .B. Gaines a guy who has rejected from all the colleges he has applied for so decides to make his own college and invites all the other people who did not make it, problem is hundreds of people sign up to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was lucky enough to buy it for $5.00 at a sale and I have always watched it since. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of all comedy as it is funny, witty and just a good movie all up.|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie. I am not saying this lightly. I love movies and am fairly picky about them (my home DVD collection is over 9,000 movies - some are great, others are OK, a few I do not like at all). And, to all those with criticisms: this is a comedy. I simply love this movie. It is light, funny, and very restful. I am aware of all (or most) of the deficiencies but I love it.|1
Films belonging to the `` film noir '' genre usually contain similar elements : a `` deus ex machina '' that comes at the end, a dark atmosphere with heavy shadows and rain, a first person narrative, a fatalistic view of life and a very bleak view on the world. Films in this genre are often set in the American underground after the Second World War or in the present time. However, there are two sub-genres within film noir, one set before the Second World War, and one set after, with the former being more traditional and the latter more experimental.|0
I never thought I'd say this about a biopic, but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (especially concerning Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal occurrences in his life--by the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he's supposed to), or if his sister finally dies (she's supposed to), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (that's an inside joke, in case you missed it--Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railroad).|1
Made at the height of the Black Power movement , this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope ( Arnold Johnson ) who takes over his own ad agency. There is little plot to speak of so I won’t get into that too much. However, this movie is very important because it is one of the few examples of African-American films that were made during this time. Most films with all African-Americans did not exist. This is one of a very few that did exist. In fact, this movie is so unique that it can hardly be classed as a “black” movie.|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I 've seen in a very long time. This movie had it all. Action, humor, drama. It didn't over do the comedy and didn't do too little of it. Everything seemed to mesh perfectly. I never felt like anything was out of place or over done. This movie has a lot to be proud of and they did a great job in my opinion. I've been to many a Marvel movie and have been mostly disappointed but this one was definitely not.|0
Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time . It has an original plot and it makes you want to rewatch it over and over again to catch the jokes you missed before . It’s a great movie that is worth your time and attention . Friday, November 16th, 2018 at 2:01 am and is filed under Movie Reviews. In this movie, a teenager who was not accepted by the high school, is invited to be a part of a group who are not allowed to sit in the school.|0
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films , it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment . The only survivors of a pandemic that has erased all human life live in a subway that is their refuge. The script is based on a 1976 short film that I’m not sure who did. The movie takes the premise and turns it into an examination of human relationships. There are very strong performances, especially from Robert John Burke, James Murtaugh, who is a blind man, and Jennifer Tung, who is a pregnant woman. Suspense builds over the 100 minutes but there is no payoff.|0
"Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters . I had never heard of this movie until this DVD and after watching it , I really felt it is a good movie and would do well at theaters if it had gotten a release . If you have not heard of this film , do not let that deter you . If you have , I highly recommend it as it is a good movie and well worth watching . It will be in theaters shortly so be sure to put this one on your "" Must See In The Theaters "" list ."|0
I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I think that the critics are reviewing the old show, but it has been revamped. I was not sure what to expect but it was good. I don't want to ruin it for you so I'm not giving away any major plot points. What I can say is that there are some good laugh out loud parts in it. I am a big comic book, sci fi, action film fan and I really enjoyed the show.|0
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history, someone had to be the first. One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms, Charlie Chaplin invented the genre.Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move. When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope, Abbott&Costello, Laurel&Hardy involved military service and made during war time, it's just something you accept and laugh at.In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours.|1
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year . You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and 5 or 6 at any given time on the Encore channel. But it is hard to keep up with these stories. I don’t know whether I am a true-crime junkie or not, but I’ve read and seen at least 2 dozen books and stories on JonBenet Ramsay, the murder of Lacy Peterson, Amanda Knox and the rest. The most recent of these was 2007’s An Unbelievable Story of Rape.|0
This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies . Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 4 was not bad. Death Wish 2 was just terrible. Death Wish 3 is in the middle. I enjoyed it , because it has Bronson who is the main character in these movies , and he is one of the best action stars ever.He is very good at kicking the bad guy's butts. The bad guy's in this are no match for Bronson and they know it.They know they can't kill him. I liked it because it had lots of action and a pretty good story.|0
Another go round with the monkey king going west....sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie just goes from the first frame onward.A monk and his three disciples go to a town to get the sacred suras that will bring peace to the world once they are translated and spoken to the world.But an evil force has intervened and kidnapped all of the children of the town. The evil force wants the monk because if you eat him you will live forever. The retainers battle the forces of darkness before forcibly sending the monk off for safety (The monk thinks he can win simply by reasoning with the bad guys).|1
`` Pearl Harbor , buddy . '' This movie is brilliant ! Sure it does n't exactly flow like an epic story, but it is one of the most realistic war movies I 've ever seen ( I 've seen a few ) . Even the acting was great ! As far as the story goes , well , there was really no story , just an action movie with little plot . But , as a movie , it is brilliant ! If I had to rate this movie I 'd give it about 4 or 4.5 stars .|0
"This movie is truly a classic 80s movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS!!!! In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! And keeping with the classic 80's ""bad guy vs good guy"" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing down thugs and CREEPS with a 30 caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"|1
"Spike Milligan 's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years , and 2002 's 'Puckoon ' is one of the latest failures. It was written by the comedian and is based on his 1963 masterpiece novel. ""Puckoon is one of the best novels of its decade. It is unclassifiable, utterly brilliant, and should be made into a movie by someone with imagination, taste, wit, and a passion to bring it to the screen. ""- John Kennedy Toole, A Confederacy of Dunces author. ""It is a brilliant satirical novel and deserving of film treatment."|0
Hey all you jive hustlers , you stone foxes , you mean dudes . Watch out cause Slaughter is back and this time he means business ! I just bought a 2006 Honda Shadow Aero and I love the way it drives , handles and feels but there is one nagging thing I am starting to hear after a few miles of riding that bothers me. Its a rattling sound that changes in pitch depending on how you are riding but seems to be the loudest when in a slow steady cruise. I cant seem to figure out the exact source of the sound .|0
"This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land ""far away from it all"" where ""living things have room to grow."" Its people are ""living and growing together"" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this ""world that is spinning around"" and to ""look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies."""|1
A labor of love . Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you . Then the sheer emotion and story-telling of each frame just captures you in a way that most books don’t even come close to . You feel for the protagonists , the story and the events that unfold in a way like you have not felt for a book for ages . You will feel like you were right there with them at that time , living that life of that era , going through the trials and tribulations that life brought for them and the way that they fought for what they felt was their destiny .|0
Then again , I like Rachael Ray . She is fun , sweet , fresh , and such a joy to listen to . She makes cooking seem so easy . I can't believe I'm actually going to attempt to cook one of her recipes tonight , it's a good thing the recipe is on-line and I can get the recipe from here if I can't follow it . LOL . I just have to see if all the ingredients we have in our pantry , I think I may be good to go . I've never actually watched any episodes of her shows but I do love her .|0
"I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime , Lifetime Movie Network
I don't know why it's a Lifetime movie. That would be a good question for Lifetime. It was probably a movie on a cable movie channel and Lifetime bought it to air on LMN. LMN doesn't air original movies, it's a Lifetime property that airs films that were originally made for TV movies or cable movies. I was just wondering about the filming. If it was made in 2005, how was it aired, if not on TV?"|0
Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over.|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which more or less takes place in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric trail of characters) of writer Joseph Minion's comedy, 'After Hours.' In a sort of desert roadtrip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and redemption, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever 10 year-old boy cashes in his piggy bank, steals a Mustang, and runs away from his grossly neglecting parents.|1
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8-episode trip to all the animals under the sea!The cinematography is astounding, bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing each episode, is how they made it! Whether it is making models of creatures, or those impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it!2001 had some great tv shows to our screen.|1
"When the trailer for Accepted first came up , many people began to get excited about seeing it ... really, how could they not? When a trailer for a movie comes up, many people begin to wonder about the quality of it. There's been so many bad movies lately that when a good movie comes around, people want to see it ... and they'll put out a lot of money for it. I have to admit, the first time I saw a commercial for Accepted, I was like, ""I'm seeing this."""|0
"The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no other reason than the fact that he is black, and the agency needs a ""token"" on the board. Swope is ignoring the meeting, reading Jet magazine at the big table, and everybody is ignoring Swope... Suddenly, the CEO croaks on the spot. No time is wasted. A janitor is called to haul off the corpse, and the board immediately and unceremoniously tackles the business of electing a new CEO."|1
"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school."|1
This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White , Cinderella , or Bambi , but it IS a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that is sure to make your little girls (and big ones, too) squeal with delight! It’s a story of three little kittens, Pouncival, Tom Thumb, and Peek a Boo, who are lost and searching for their lost mother. They eventually find her and learn the meaning of the word ‘teamwork’. They also make a new friend – a dog named Squeek. But Squeek isn’t your average dog.|0
Although this film never attained commercial notoriety , my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of cinema go unnoticed for reasons other than content. In fact, some are overshadowed by a combination of untimely release and/or inadequate distribution. In 2000, this was such a film. Although released in mid-June, by the time it reached my area, it had already closed. And this film deserved a much better run. It was that good. I did not read the novella prior to this film, and so was going in blind.|0
I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast ! There were 5 of us and we all enjoyed it immensely. There is action and lots of it. There is a good plot. There are some good laughs. Oh and did I say there is a ton of action? Chris Pine looks good in anything so I guess it's OK that he is shirtless a few times. I've read reviews saying the film is predictable. If that bothers you, go see another movie. Really, how many ways can they tell a story anyway?|0
The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . The original Paul Kersey was a quiet man who was forced to become an urban warrior against crime after his house was broken into while his wife was brutally raped and murdered in front of him. Kersey himself was brutally attacked with a fire poker to the head, which knocked him unconscious, and then he was forced to clean up the mess left by the perps. He had to do it because he was in no shape to clean up his own home.|0
As an English teacher, I appreciate films that do more than tell a story. Good films, like good literature, cause one to think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film, their choices do not seem as adolescent or felonious as other films I have seen. The acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other.|1
"I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I'm dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) ""captures"" his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly's portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity's struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end?"|1
"I don't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor. You need to get your head out of your up-tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious! If this isn't your ""cup of tea"", so to speak, then look at it for what it truly is- a damn funny movie. Maybe they DID set out to make yet another drugs/T&A movie, but in this case, they've truly hit the spot. It's especially funny for the Ali G fans, because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him."|1
There 's no point in comparing this with the original series . Though different in look and content , both are very good anime for the younger kids . It has always been an interesting story. I would highly recommend this if you like fantasy shows or if you've read the book. The story is great. The characters are memorable. The animation and sound quality are top notch and the show is an overall great piece of entertainment! This is amazing. The story is excellent. The art is brilliant. The soundtrack and music are superb.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner's mansion in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady is leaving everything in her will to the cats first, the butler is angered, because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and abandons them off the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long trek home. A street wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets up with them and offers to help them.|1
It 's Showtime ! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro 's careers . It 's also a comedy film that is so bad that it actually hurts one 's ears to listen to it. This film was made to make money from two superstars, it was an easy task. The story is about the two superstars and they play in the showbiz. So basically, it 's like a documentary about two guys trying to make money off their fame and popularity. Robert and Eddie play themselves and the movie starts off as a sitcom and then they take the viewers on the show.|0
You know , people who make comedies so often forget it 's really ok to be outrageous . Well , I don't think this film is ever really outrageous but it is very funny and it takes the viewer on a ride where you never know what to expect. It has a few scenes that may be overly violent for some , but nothing really shocking. And , I think this is the perfect comedy for people who have little time and want a film that will entertain and make them laugh. So , watch this one , have a great time and enjoy .|0
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it. Nothing to do, not in the cinemas, nor on DVD neither on Blue ray. Absolutely nothing!!! How it's possible this could really happen??? The direction is IMPECCABLE, the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and James Franco is hot as hell!! !Please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life!!!!!!!!!!|1
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback, and if anyone is confused about her past (like how did she end up in the same hospital Hurley was in) then you should know that despited Libby dying in season 2, the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her.BTW, great episode. It had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions...like what happened to Eko and Lock and what about the four toe statue?I cannot wait till season 3, Lost just rules!!!|1
I still ca n't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site . Such a rare book and I was one of the first who bought one. I will keep it for ever. The quality of this book is so amazing that you can't stop staring to the images. 100 pages of pure inspiration, I could have spent hours and hours with my eyes closed in front of such a beautiful piece of work. It's a book for those who love fashion and art and it's for sure one of the best books I've bought recently.|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days . It was not a pleasant memory to have . I was a 7th grader ( 1974), and was in a new school in the city of Miami . It was the first time ever I ever saw such a violent television show . This show was one of my favorites back then. I was a kid and I remember watching this show when it was on and loving it. After the show was cancelled I didn’t see any episodes for a while and then I did, I think they had it on USA.|0
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love, passion, and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film BLINDSPOT.BLINDSPOT'S diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting  journey to the core of the human soul. As a director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors. With superb editing, especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end. A thriller which leaves much to the minds' eye.What an  astounding accomplishment for Stephan Woloszczuk. Cheers Stephan!|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar ! The film took a while to pick up from the first 45 minutes, it was slow moving, but after that, it was a fast moving and funny show. Jim Carrey is great in the movie, he portrays himself as well as the character he was given. Steve Carrels is also good in the role, and has a great chemistry with Jim. I would have to say the best acting of the show came from Steve Carrels. The movie wasn't too special effects oriented, but it had its share.|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development. Fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work, vivid cinematography, and yes - wonderfully explicit gore.This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, House by the Cemetery, etc.) the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who-dunnit amongst the lush hills of Italy.|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only that this was one of my all time favorites as a kid, and I still watch these episodes as an adult. This show is a great example of why I like Sci-fi, great story, great effects. It has been shown in re-runs for years on many cable channels. One of my fondest memories was watching reruns with my Dad, he is a fan of sci-fi and horror and I think he was the reason I became such a fan.|0
Not a stunner, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just act; his writing was pretty darn good. Great supporting cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as the extortionist private eye.The movie's greatest strength is the work of Macy, who reminds us of his Jerry Lundergaard role from Fargo. He has numerous scenes where he is extremely funny as a slimy, manipulating and deceitful character. It's enjoyable to watch him be a weasel, and for a while I was happy that things were turning out well for him.|1
"This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people would n't like it . It is not an action adventure movie. There is no gun play . No sword fights . It is just very well written and performed by some of the greats in cinema. If you 'd like to know what I thought , click here. Jeffrey R. Houpt December 29, 2014 at 12:31 PM
That was a great review and thank you for sharing. The 1959 is a classic for me as well. The story is timeless, and the acting is simply superlative."|0
"When I first saw this movie,I also expected ""our boys"" to be cute,and more like an extended version of the TV show. I didn't ""get it"" back then. But,years later,at a party YEARS later,at a 70s' type PAR-TAY,where certain substances had been smoked,inhaled,and with plenty of tequila,""HEAD"" was on late at night.We watched it,and finally realized what ""HEAD"" was all about. It spoofed their own show,as shown in one song that called themselves,""a manufactured image""."|1
This is Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth , or at least this is what can be expected. Christmas time ! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least that is what we expect. As it is written, every end is a new beginning. We can never forget those who have passed away, and to whom this is not a beginning. There is a saying, we do not die but only leave. It is not a beginning as such but only a continuation. It is in a way like going to another level, another state, another dimension, another life.|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film (which is excellent). It borrows the main premise--a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer. But I like that the writers chose an English professor, instead of a private dick, as the protagonist. The plot is also quite original. In general, the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake. But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it (probably due to the horrendous 80's original music score)combined with an affected ""noir"" feel."|1
"""Blind Spot"" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is particularly amazing as the broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the visuals and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge-drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love."|1
Film auteur Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depths of love , passion , and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss. Based on the classic novel written by Henry De Vere Stacpoole. Sailing is a way of life. This is about the passion of sailing in all its glory, the thrill of being at the helm, the joy of the company of good friends and family on a day of sunny fun, sailing together, and sailing on. This is also about loss, the heartbreak and the struggle when a great love is gone.|0
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard-pressed. HEAD is a masterpiece of non-linear non-structure, surrealism and experimentaion. In less than 90 minutes, it manages to be not only a time-capsule of an era, but also a full-length experimental feature that defies time,space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could.HEAD is a reflection of those films. No matter how one feels about the Monkees, this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium.|1
This little film is hysterical , full of stereotypes about gays , straights , dwarfs , British tea and pubs. Honestly I can't say whether it was meant to be funny or offensive but I thought it was the funniest thing I've seen in quite some time! Either way you will laugh at it and if you don't there is definitely something wrong with you! BTW if anyone wants to see more British comedy , I'd be happy to oblige...just ask. I laughed a lot at this, but it was mostly out of pity for the guys who had to play the dwarfs.|0
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight.|1
"Better than it has any right to be , this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office, despite the fact that it is the funniest movie of the year so far, and a lot better than other films that made more money, and that were more hyped. The movie is basically a one-liner machine, like a Marx Brothers film, or maybe Airplane , in that it relies on gag after gag instead of a continuous plot, and in the end I found myself just laughing my ass off. The plot is essentially a retread of ""Airplane!"|0
"If we could have ""Separate Tables,"" why not ""Separate Lies. ""This becomes somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed when he is hit by a car while on a bicycle. The culprit turns out to be the woman she cleans for. The latter was having an affair with a friend and was driving the car with the lover in it when the accident occurred. To complicate matters further, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents and he had her jailed for stealing. Therefore, people will hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident."|1
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the low-key approach of the Wizard of Oz, but it's a classic nonetheless, and has all the components necessary for a good film: a strong story, great performances, beautiful visuals, and memorable music. It's still a joy to experience. The Wizard of Oz won't impress anyone who's not familiar with this 1939 classic, but it will delight them and remind them why this is such an important movie.|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson's work, and for about as long as I've known his name, I've also looked for this movie. I tried looking for this movie all over California for over four years. this past summer i took a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least see this movie. long story short, I bought it and watched it in France! I was blown away, it completely made my trip and i finally feel content that i have seen Luc Besson's first work.|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy , which meant that I got to travel round the World. I am proud to have been in the RN at a particular time when many of my friends were conscripted to the Army, which was a most unpleasant experience. I am now semi retired and spend the time working in the garden , which in turn gives me more time to spend on my painting. I am also a keen amateur photographer , which provides inspiration for painting.|0
I Loved this movie . Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role . More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade with Blankfield in the role . This movie is way better than the original. The actors were able to make the characters feel real, and you could relate to the characters, which was a major factor in me liking it more. It's a good movie; it just pales in comparison to the 1984 version, which is still one of my absolute favorite movies. This remake did not have any of the fear or the anticipation, the terror or the suspense of the original 1955 version.|0
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage 's better films . He turns a fine performance as the wartorn Captain Antonio Corelli who occupies a small Greek Island with his regiment during the early days of the 2nd World War. As a means of keeping the peace between two feuding families, he offers his services by playing his mandolin to them at the family's taverna. It is here he comes across the beautiful Pelagia and the two become infatuated with each other. However, Corelli is in love with Melina, one of the daughters from the opposing families who is to marry the local doctor.|0
This is sweet . The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira on the Fright Nights episode. She's very hot in both roles. I've been searching for a copy of this one for ages! Now that I've seen a few screen shots from it, I'm really going to have a hard time not downloading this one. What a great show you guys run. Keep it up. Nice episode, but I agree with a previous poster who mentioned it was missing something. There is something about this series that makes it a little less than perfect.|0
Years ago when I first read John Irving 's The World According to Garp , I was astounded that most folks had no clue that the storyline was based upon a real event. The story revolved around a writer of female centric romance novels and his mother. The mother, who is a nurse, is accidentally shot and killed as she was performing her duties in a local Emergency Room; thus the story of the writer and his love of women begins. I have to say that when the news first hit me that Jodi Arias has been found guilty on all charges against her I was a bit disappointed.|0
I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden.|1
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen : much better and deeper than Luhrman’s The Great Gatsby, which I thought it was going to be amazing, but ended being very shallow and empty. Snowqueen takes the fairytale about the boy Kay from Hans Christian Andersen and shows it from the perspective of Gerda, who is a child when we first see her and grows up as the story unfolds. The little boy Kay, her best friend, is kidnapped and Gerda goes on a quest to save him, which turns out not to be so easy.|0
Let's be fair: there are no RULES for scriptwriting, so I won't say the movie SHOULD be something other than it is. I'll just state my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and characters are introduced. However, I think when a play is adapted to the silver screen, it could maybe try and fit this other media. Since this movie was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the play, it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical.|1
Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in! I love watching him!! i was 10 yrs old (1979) when i seen him for the first time.i eagerly await each and everything he'll be acting in. hopefully one day i can see him in person. he's very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is commanding and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely stunning!!!! In my opinion he is the greatest actor iv'e ever seen!|1
"I think it definitely is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after its dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey(Bronson) and Ms. Kathryn Davis(Deborah Raffin) (more about this character later) is extremely clear and to the point: Ms. Davis says, ""I hope you like chicken. It's the only thing I know how to make,"" to which Kersey deftly responds, ""Chicken's good. I like chicken."""|1
I think that this short TV series , was absolutely wonderful , and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation as to what was happening in the lives of the characters , and of course the ending was excellent ! It also showed a lot of what happens behind the scenes of a police station ! It really was an excellent production ! I do hope that there is a series two in the making , as it would be a real pity to loose this excellent cast ! I just saw this show on Amazon Prime for free and thought it was awesome. The acting was superb.|0
What a great film! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but was familiar with his lively and fun music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change the music in the 1950's. Although I never cared for Gary Bussey, he was fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the movie is, but assume at least for the most part it is accurate, which makes the movie all the more interesting. The music throughout the movie just adds the pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change a thing in this film, it was all good!|1
"Although this film never attained commercial notoriety, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not gain mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and embarking on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little basis in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone who attempts to view this film from the perspective of its conformity to reality will likely be disappointed; it is not intended to be ""realistic."" It is, however, intended to be metaphoric with extensive symbolism apparent to those with superb attention to detail."|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good. I have to admit Ms Cruz can really act. She puts on a very good performance. In fact she our does her boyfriend Tom in drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicholas Cage seemed to be enjoying himself. I bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an Italian. However, I did learn something. One more chapter in Horrors of Nazi Germany the many Italian soliders killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and Germany's eventual surrender.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie . She was only 19 years old when this film was shot. She was gorgeous, a true star from the moment she entered the film. This movie also stars Robert Taylor who was 11 years her senior, but she was his equal as an actor and dancer. This movie is definitely worth seeing, not just for its star power, but because the choreography was great. It's from the same period that Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, and Gene Kelly were making their dancing marks in film.|0
"Exclusively for Coop's lovers, though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film. It is a biography of Gary Cooper, based mainly on his filmography, but also on more private archives, which show him as a child, as a young man, as a family man, with some of his friends (Picasso, Hemingway, etc. ), as an older man, finally as a sick and close-to-death man. After ""the end"", I did not have the feeling that I knew the man any much better."|1
Chucky is back but this time he is not scary (a lot) - but he is funny!When Chucky is brought back to life (in the doll, of course) by his old trailer trash girlfriend, Tiffany, he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll, too. Tiffany and Chucky are now on the case of 2 high school graduates - eekkk! !Don't miss this film - it is a whole lot of fun. It is scary, funny, weird, wacky and stupid all in one!My rating : 9/10.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years. Many of his stories have been adapted to screen. Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The older brother, Pete Greer, goes to Memphis, Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men, some who would never come home. His younger brother doesn't take his departure well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother.|1
"I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10 , and it just blew my mind away and since I been watching it off and on til this day I own the first season on dvd and I love this show still to this day!!!! Out of all the episodes I like ""the Bellero Shield"" and ""Demon With The glass hands"" and ""the Architects of Fear"", and ""A Feasibility study""
I'm glad they'll be showing it again , I will be sure to watch every Saturday night!!!"|0
Well , what 's wrong with the title `` Separate Lies '' ( accused elsewhere of not being `` exciting enough for a blog title ) . Well , I guess when it comes down to it , there are some movies which you just watch without being `` excited '' about them , and if you don't want to watch them , then you watch them anyway . This is one such movie for me , it was on TV the other night so I recorded it , and I thought well , why not . And why not ?|0
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalz.This is a fantastic film, its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently. Tell everyone you know to go see it now- FANTASTIC!The acting is excellent, and Dublin plays a starring role. This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema. I can't wait til it comes out on DVD.|1
This is one of my favorite films , ever . The story is just so fantastic and the characters are great . The film has got it's funny moments but they are not overdone so that you get tired of the film . I have seen it about 50 times or so and I never get tired of it . I would love it if there was a sequel . The only thing bad i can think of is that in the beginning of the movie when they are on the ship , one of the other guys in the movie looks so much like Willie Nelson that i thought it was him at first .|0
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre , but I think this one is done quite well. I've always enjoyed stories like this. I love the idea of getting caught in the midst of all the action and having no idea who to trust or which way to turn. I enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads and the way they played off of eachother. I'd love to see a full feature movie with this storyline. It has just enough creepy stuff to keep you on your toes without being gory or terrifying.|0
"What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier. Funny guy Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights) is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr. Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde. The one scene that is really funny is when Dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says: ""how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter."" Jekyll replies, ""but sir, I'm going ahead with the operation. ""Lanyon replies back, ""oh."|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre . Set in New Orleans , the film has strong elements of voodoo, the supernatural and some nice splatter effects . It stars a very young and good looking Tomas Milian as a man who inherits a fortune, but then discovers that his dead wife's family are out to get him and his wealth . The film has an excellent cast, which also includes Maria Petrano and Maria Teresa Ricci . The film does drag in the middle but once the murdering starts up again, the film becomes much more watchable.|0
As a film buff , I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny , sarcastic comments about this flick. So what made me go and see this movie ? Well, I like watching a movie at the very first week of its release , so that I could be a part of the audience who watched it at first . The theater was packed. There was an old lady with a hearing problem sitting on my right , who kept looking at me in surprise every time a loud sound came out of the screen . My husband and I were trying very hard to be very attentive .|0
After seeing The Aristocats : Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound , I decided to pick up the Fox and the Hound - Special Edition . This film is not one I am very familiar with, but when I saw this version of it in a two pack at a great price I decided to get it. The movie is about two young animals who are childhood friends. Tod is a young fox and Copper is a pup who has been raised by a hunter. They eventually get separated and when they do they become enemies.|0
This is a funny movie. The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I doubt it will make enough money. Deniro proves he can be a great Straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of CGI animals and rodents. Rene Russo- well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent.Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the garbage truck scene. This was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out-takes at the end.|1
Damien O'Donnell has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but without being patronising. The story concerns a girl who has just lost her parents, her older brother is mentally retarded and her younger brother is only 7. With no other relatives to help raise the kids, she finds herself having to take on the responsibilty of becoming a parent to her brother which is a big burden for someone so young. The movie shows her taking on her new role while also growing up and experiencing new emotions, such as love, first love.|0
"Is this a good movie? It's hard to say -- but in 1953, for many people, it was a remarkably effective movie, suspenseful, scary and then, amazingly, actually touching when ""the old gentleman"" meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie.Yes, what lurks in the Maze turns out to be something of a surprise and, for a lot of people, a hilarious one. But the basic idea (ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny) was a very real one at the time the book was written, and does have some basis in fact."|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing? Never heard of them!! But this is one of the funniest comedies I have run across. It should win the Putz Puller Prize for Parody. The absurd starts with Dr. Jeykl snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend.He is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Pay attention to the hospital PA system in the background; rather like the system in MASH. The final scene with Hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years.|1
"As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip ""If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon""). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation."|1
`` Showtime '' is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro ( Meet the Parents , A Bronx Tale ) and Eddie Murphy ( Shrek , Beverly Hills Cop ). It has also starred some of the most talented actresses in the industry. Eddie Murphy plays a detective named Mitch and he and his partner, Marcus, played by De Niro, come across a case of art forgery involving a world famous painter. As they investigate the crime they discover that it has many twists and turns, with the main focus of the mystery being a young woman named Sara, who turns out to be one of the artists.|0
"There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something ""not human"" is portraying human beings and I think that this film is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this film could be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone did not - I feel the cats are jolly good in this film portraying humans! :-)This film also focuses on quite a lot of adult issues - which is rather odd for a Disney film."|1
This is a wonderful movie , and I still love it ! It just so magical and it is funny , and the characters are very likable . The movie makes me laugh every time , and it makes me want to be back in my childhood . The characters are good , and the acting is wonderful , and the costumes are colorful . This is a magical movie that i will always love ! This is a movie that is timeless , and a movie that everyone can love . The movie is very good , and it will be one that I will watch over and over again .|0
I 've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it, but you know what, it surprised me that I liked it. Of course it has some bad things, like some of the acting is a bit weak, but as a horror film, it's just good enough. It is very scary at the beginning, when the couple was in the desert, they were on their way to their wedding, and then the car just stops. Then he goes out and hears strange sounds around him.|0
It was Libby talking to Desmond in the flashback , and if anyone is confused about her past ( like me! )...this is how it plays out.. I think she is talking about her and Eloise, who we learn later was a psychologist...who had a thing for Desmond, so she was trying to keep him safe. Libby is in the looneybin...and she was a patient who wanted to escape, who escaped with Desmond... In the present , Desmond is the only one on the boat that knows he's on an island..|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful yet heartbreakingly sad tale. The film begins at the funeral of Adrienne Willis (Lane), a New York journalist and mother of two who, after 12 years of marriage has just separated from her husband. On the way back home on the same day she has to pick up her 14-year-old daughter and return to New York. She arrives back at her beautiful house on the beach in North Carolina to find that the house has been rented out to a handsome stranger, Paul (played by Richard Gere).|0
I am a guy , so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear is so beautiful , and i dont want to feel like a gay guy watching the movie . But after watching the movie , i feel that it's a very touching love story and i enjoy the movie very much . I know it must be very painful for the director , and it's a kind of sacrifice . I really enjoy watching the movie . Hmm. I've been seeing a number of movies recently that touch me quite a bit. 'The Notebook', for instance.|0
I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development . Fulci was a master at creating horrific scenes of terror without gore. This film was an excellent addition to his already stellar resume'. I was pleasantly surprised by The Beyond. I expected a trashy, gory film. Instead, the film is slow and moody and the gore is limited to the last 20 minutes of the film. The atmosphere is what I liked most about The Beyond. The soundtrack, the visuals and the direction are all top notch. The Beyond is an excellent example of why Fulci should be considered an important director.|0
I saw this film at a small screening . Even though it had a low budget , the creative direction , the music choices and the cast , I am glad to be part of it . I had a lot of fun , and I can't wait for the next one . Stay tuned for more . Here is the teaser for the short film LIFT. It was a very nice experience . Here are a couple of images of my character from this upcoming short . I would like to wish a very happy 4th of July to all of my friends and followers .|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time . Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. I recently purchased it on DVD and watch it over and over again. Great movie with a wonderful message to our children and society. We have seen this movie numerous times, and it still holds up well. It's a good movie for a family movie night. I thought it was a very enlightening movie. The story was easy to follow, yet deep in the way that all stories are. The characters were all very dynamic and real.|0
I love this movie, though I don't like how they picture Egyptians, being an Egyptian citizen myself! that's why it earns an eight out of 10.The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is awkward, and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long, he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that leopard.A very touching scene when the leopard dies, watch Augustin's reaction.. All in all I find it enjoyable, and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.|1
"This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally , at the end of the 1960 's. It has an amazing sound track. I think it is so good I bought the LP from Amazon. It is set on the fictional ""Island of Peace"" and has a great cast. Richard Harris and Jean Seberg were my favourites. It was also the first of a long line of films which had a young Harrison Ford as their star. The film was shot in the Bahamas , so there was no expense spared on the wonderful scenery."|0
This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to them. If you want them to laugh, too. I love it. And now it is the only one of the series I have left. I've never watched this movie. Although I've seen every other movie in the series, I can't even remember seeing this one's title on TV, let alone rent it. I know I've seen this one but not in a while. I'm with you though. This may be the best one.|0
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the story of how he came to be there. In the flash back you get a little bit of what is happening in the present while the story focuses on the soldier. The story is interesting but I feel it was too long and could have easily been shorter and more effective. The book is also full of clichéd situations that I found boring. Besides being long I did enjoy it and I'm glad that I got it for free.|0
My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film . I have got to say that this is probably the best film I've seen this semester in my cinema class , and I love the fact that the director went with an older camera and used film , it just felt more authentic and less CGI than what we usually get from hollywood . I actually had to get into character for this role as it was very challenging to do. I am a 5'11 132lbs and I had to play an older woman.|0
What an excellent movie, made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it so serendipitously, channel surfing on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is at her usual best leading a cast of very normal and human costar characters thru one of the most wonderful feel good movies we've ever seen. Why this movie wasn't given the attention it deserved on it's release in 2002 is difficult to understand. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of trash released with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing.|1
I first saw The Victim ( aka Out Of Contention ) well over 25 years ago when I was very young, and had to wait until the film came to TV before I could see it, as it had been banned in my home country of South Africa. My first thought after seeing it was 'that was good' , my next thought after it was over, 'I need to see that again'. As I grew up I started seeing more and more of director Pat Jackson's work. I love his films, and I am sure I have not seen them all.|0
People comparing this movie to big blockbusters like Lord of the Rings or the Matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful amalgamation of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an A-list cast. My particular favourite from this movie is Bridget Fonda, whose performance as the Snow Queen herself was quite moving, assisted enormously by a stupendous wardrobe and makeup.|1
"""Back in the Day"" is an interesting, but flawed effort. Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper, a honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames) who tries to force Reggie into a life of crime. Reggie also falls in love with Alica (Tatyana Ali) who is the preacher's daughter. Now he has to choose: Love Or Crime.Ja Rule does a competent job as Reggie. At least he's trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as J-Bone."|1
Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful place in cult film history. But Fulci has also made a couple of great Euro-cult westerns during the 1970s that often goes overlooked by many western fans. Amongst these westerns are the very underrated I quattro dell'apocalisse from 1975, an atmospheric mix of western and horror. The film takes place in a small western town in 1880 and tells the tale about four mysterious men that shows up in town riding four white horses. There is rumors about these four men being involved in robberies in other western towns.|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol. It has singing, the British Guy, A guy who's sometimes nice, and a super-nice woman.Of course it is different because there is a sing-off, and there's dancing and some acting (we just don't see some of the acting). I gave this show a 7 because there are a couple tweaks that I know a lot of people (including me)would make if they were working for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is the judges deciding who goes home.|1
"Anyone who has seen Ali G before , should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse'! After 3 very funny TV series, Ali G has now finally got his own full length movie! ""Based upon the most successful comedy series ever made, ALI G INDAHOUSE is the hilarious big-screen adventure of our beloved hero. As the world's most wanted man, Ali G unwittingly becomes the centre of attention to the British media when his passport is discovered in the possession of an arms dealer."|0
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not : intelligence and good messages . Accepted , though entertaining , is only a funny movie . This movie is a lot more : it is a lesson to be learned for everybody who wants to find the way to success . This movie will help you understand that it is you who can achieve your own success : that no one can help you with it . The main character in the movie ( played brilliantly by Michael Keaton ) is very different from you and me : he has nothing at all , no education , and no family .|0
I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans . Okay I 'm sure it 's not as good as the others but I enjoyed it. It 's a little bit of fun. Chuckie's a good guy this time...I think. I know it is hard to believe. This is my favorite Chucky movie since Bride Of Chucky. It is a good film for kids. I had a good time seeing this at the theater with my five year old daughter. She was not scared during the film and enjoyed it. I felt it was better than the first two films.|0
TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame.|1
My husband and I watched this last night ... It was wonderful .... For once he was wrong in guessing the ending and the ending did not involve a car crash ..... But it would have been good to see the other ending as well. We had watched it last week, thought it was good. I'm glad you watched it and enjoyed it. I'll give a spoiler alert. It was about a young mother who loses her baby and how she goes through different stages of her life before she finds her happiness. I have been thinking about that movie too ...|0
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance, a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - and beautiful scenery. Nicholas Cage never fails us, and here again does a great job. And so do the other principle characters. One key charater, the physician/father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I've ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too coincidental to be real, but I excused that, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantacy. My wife and I really liked the film.|1
As I have said before , I am NOT a fan of Tweety . He 's just so aggravating I can't stand him . He's just soooooooooooooooooooooooo condescending . I am glad to see his ratings going down . I just wonder who is going to be the next talking head with their head up their *** to be put on the hot seat by the Right ? Tweety's got a real chip on his shoulder . I'll bet if you go through the archives of this board, you'll find more people who share your opinions of Tweety as you will the people who defend him.|0
This version of `` The Lost Horizon '' is actually not a bad film at all . I think the main problem is a lot of the people who have never read the book did not like the movie because they were going in to watch an action packed film and got something else, something much better. The only reason why I think people should have known what this movie was really about before watching it was because it was based off a famous book, but I do not think that is enough for a person to know if they will like it before watching the movie.|0
OK , so I loved Rachael Ray before , but now , I ADORE her ! How innovative . I have been doing this for years, although I had forgotten it . I love that she gave this to people in a restaurant , I have not done that but it would be fun ! You could be creative and draw a heart and write I Love You on a napkin and give that as a present to a person . I know my Mom would be tickled pink about that . She has always loved to get little things like that . They are so fun !|0
Very touching film , a great surprise to come up from Brazil , a country that usually exports features about Carnaval, sex, and drugs. This is another story. It remembers me a little of “Alice in Wonderland” because the main character of the story is a girl with a serious mental disorder, but she is very different from “Alice”, because she is a woman, and she is very young. “Alice” in this film is played by Marilia Pera, who was a model and the film started as a video.|0
I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a party dressed as a penguin or whatever... They might wanna consider the possibility that the party-goers might not even notice their there. I mean, it'd be kinda like dressing in a black suit and being a chalk outline of a person. Though maybe you'd get to dance with somebody. I guess that it's a good thing that I've never felt the need to be somebody that I'm not. But I can understand why people want to become somebody else, even for just one night.|0
I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I've described that scene to folks not familiar with this film. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones who saw it. Nice to see here that others found it as hysterical as I had, and see it's lasting value despite the time gone by. Rent it, buy it or steal it.... a must see.|1
At one time ` Buddy Cop ' movies ruled the box office . It seemed that every summer flocks of people poured into the movie theaters to watch such flicks as ` Police Academy ' or ` Lethal Weapon ' . But in recent years , the sub genre seems to have fallen by the wayside . ` The Heat ' is the latest film in the lineage but I have to say , I think this is a solid addition . While on an undercover mission , Detective Mullins ( Jamie Foxx ) is killed and Boston Detective Sargent Mullins ( Melissa McCarthy ) is demoted to patrol.|0
At one time `Buddy Cop' movies ruled the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop wannabes descended on our nation's theaters. Not any more. Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle. The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Showtime, a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre.Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a Dirty Harry type by any means. He's just incredibly focused professional who's completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his dutieslike, say, a T.V.|1
I am a guy, so i was very hesitant to watch the movie because i know that Richard Gear likes to be in tear jerker movies. I would rather watch action/adventure/sci fi. I was right, the movie is definitely a tear jerker. Diane tended to over act a few times, as did richard, but they brought it around and made it work. The daughter was a suppressed teen with huge attitude, so you started out hating her. The movie is way too predictable, but for entertainment purposes, it was a masterpiece.|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery 's best performances in a movie , and I have seen almost all of her work in film , she is great , as are her co stars in this movie , you won 't be disappointed !!! It’s amazing. I love it. I’ve seen it a million times. Well written, good acting, good directing. Sad, yet a very good movie!! Great movie. The actors were good too. Lots of drama, and lots of tears. I really liked it.|0
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004 's Academy Awards , My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to understand his estranged father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Kahn, who is most famous for buildings such as The Kimbell Art Museum, the Salk Institute and the Parliament House in Dhaka, is considered by many to be the greatest of the great American architects. He was also an infamous womanizer and egotist, and Kahn's family was his third wife's family. Kahn, as a young man, worked for Frank Lloyd Wright.|0
"I saw a sneak preview of this Tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast! After seeing sneak peaks for BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10) I enjoyed this a lot more! As seen in the trailer, one knock I had was believing that a whole town could be ""forgotten"" but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so I accept it for what it is.My only major complaint is I assumed Paris Hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc. and moan ""that's hot"" but they didn't do that (how could they resist???"|1
I wonder why I haven't heard of this movie before. It's truly a magnificent comedy (I'd say farce, but it's too well acted and I'd hate to denigrate it's quality). A comedic character study about the travails of mid-life crises, the inequity for gays who can't have their long-time unions recognized, and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society, that pairs Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert should do another movie together.|1
"I went to the pre-screening of ""Rory O'Shea Was Here."" I like this movie better than I expected, because the excellent casts and the powerful performance. It's a film about the friendship of two handicapped young man. Rory is free spirit young man who wants to be independent regardless his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move his two fingers but he can talk eloquently and help his new pal, Michael, who has cerebral palsy and is significantly speech impaired. I guess that's enough to start with a weeping drama. Well, it is."|1
"Mark Blankfield (from the old late night TV show ""Fridays"")plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll, a mild-mannered surgeon who invents a powder that turns him into a drug-crazed party animal. This was not, of course, his intent, he had higher aspirations, but he goes with the flow. This is actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's also pretty fun. Of course, once the good doctor realizes what he's done, he's ashamed, but he's also not above doing it all again & running through Hollywood as a crazed sex machine with frizzed out hair & gold chains."|1
"As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old, I adore AristoCats. It is a movie that contains no double-entendres, no almost-swear words like heck or darn, no parents who are functional idiots, and no crotch-smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the ""best"" kids movies these days. The story line is sweet and interesting. The music is great. The love story is quite romantic. The kittens are adorable, and the various other characters are unique and attention-capturing. The action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing."|1
"I love this movie a lot. I must get this on DVD. I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward. I'm forever amazed that Blankfield did almost nothing afterward. He made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde totally believable.The movie is plagued by it's low budget. (One atrocious edit jumps into mid-word and was described on, ""Siskel & Ebert"".) But, there are a thousand jokes, sight gags to subtle references, that more than compensate."|1
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel , I have to say I was very impressed. The episodes are very entertaining and full of action (obviously). It is a shame that the last 2 episodes of the series weren't aired on the Action Channel. I've now bought the series on DVD from Amazon and have to say I am really impressed with the quality of it. Now if they could just re-make the series, then we might have something really good on our hands! I saw them years ago on BBC1.|0
This is a 100% improvement over the dross of a third movie and it's one hell of a good time. This is a John Hughes movie meets The Devil's Rejects. I really enjoyed this movie and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany really well and Brad Dourif in Chucky's shoes once again really makes this movie shine. Actually they're the only good parts of the movie. I got rather bored with Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable's scenes. It's as if they were thrown in there as a sidetrack and someone to save the day.|1
I thought this was movie was great , Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie . I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers though , I don't think this is a good movie for children . There is alot of violence in this film , the movie is a little slow at first , but I thought that the end of the film made the movie worth while to watch . This is an excellent film . I think the only thing that could have made this film better was to have Richard Greico do a voice over explaining what was going on at the end of the movie .|0
"First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one! I watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised. The story is very good, but all the ignorant people would say ""This sucks people cant fly!"" to them i say IT'S FICTION and that it is. This is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a ""fairytale"". And a very pleasant to watch Asian fairytale. The image's can actually blow your mind. Because there so artistically filmed , Ang Lee has a very (unapreciated u might say) big talent."|1
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Blacks, Hispanics, Whites, Asians, Indians and even Muslims can get down and dirty with each other to get that big deal. And it doesn’t even matter if your wife hates your guts and sleeps with the competition. You have a family, man. It’s not her fault that she wants to eat. We learn that you should trust no one. And you shouldn’t let your wife know you’re about to go to jail.|0
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, nasty chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit his party's current leader, thus enabling him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try and guarantee his political future.Puerile, crude, misogynistic, and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut outing for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangsta, is all of these things and much moremeaning it's my kind of film!|1
"Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an ""against the system"" type of movie and attitude. It is an excellent portrayal of the ""system"" in question and how ridiculous it truly is. The funny parts in the movie are in fact funny because they speak the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this movie to be unrealistic is simply denying the self evident truths about life. And that is to learn what you enjoy. That is what college should be about..I come to find that a comment must have at least 10 lines."|1
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title . The movie was cool , despite the horrible acting . I was a little disappointed in the acting . The only real good actor in the movie was Michael Bay . This movie is so cool . I loved the effects and the way the movie was directed . I hope you guys liked it as much as I did !!! We're back , guys! We're back with another awesome review ! This week we take a look at the awesome game ""Battlefield 3"". I hope you enjoy !"|0
I 'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci 's films . Most of his 80s gore films had their flaws , some were better than others. I liked Zombi 2 a lot , Sodom 1982 is a guilty pleasure . Zombie 1979 , The New York Ripper 1981 are two of his best films. But i 've seen only one of his best films . A Lizard in a Woman 's Skin , which is a little gem and has a very unusual ending . I am not sure if I like or dislike Fulci , but he 's made some memorable and very entertaining films.|0
This show really is the Broadway American Idol . It has singing , the British Guy , A guy who looks like he’s going to lose a tooth every song ( but I still love him) , the chick with the hair , the guy that used to be on TV with a dog and the rest of them. And I love it. I’m going to admit that I like the singing part of it the best. But there is something that happens every week and it really does make me watch.|0
Then again, I like Rachael Ray. She is fun, sweet, fresh, and such a joy to watch. I have to alter just about everything she makes as I am a vegetarian...but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down-to-earth. The studio audience appears to be rather small, but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks.|1
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.This is their take on their ""manufactured image"" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.See it with an open mind."|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what was going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterizations and the introduction of Star Trek's second most important hostile alien race after the Klingons: the Romulans. After receiving a distress call from a Federation outpost, the Enterprise is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulans, although no one has ever actually seen them in the flesh.|1
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it ( typical Malibu Barbie ) but the rest of the actors are just perfect, and this movie is soooo fun to watch, a real laughter, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. The storyline is very interesting, and i must say i was impressed. I give it 5/5 because of the music and actors. Aw, it's cute. I'm not really into it but I think it's a good movie. It was ok, a little bit boring in the beginning. But overall it was great. The music is good.|0
I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and found it to be most noteworthy. It's noteworthiness is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star, John Garfield.Garfield plays Jack, a boxing star who is framed for murder. He must go on the run, and ends up out in the sticks with Gloria Dickson and the Dead End Kids. Here is offered a chance for redemption, yet will the past catch up with him yet? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers.|1
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard ( Beau Travail ) , Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that is too often weighed down by sentimental dialogue and predictable story elements. The film tells the tale of a newlywed couple who have left Italy to immigrate to America in 1903. The film begins as the young couple embarks on the journey that is to be the first chapter in their lives as newcomers to a new country. The first half-hour of the film follows them through their arduous and often perilous journey from their home in Italy to Ellis Island and eventually to New York.|0
`` Showtime '' falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying , and a little south of what others are suggesting . This film isn`t a disaster, as some critics are saying, or is it not an unqualified success as others claim. Instead, it`s a little better than those critics who are slamming the film, are saying , and a little worse than those who are praising, the film, are saying . `` Showtime '' is an odd film, in that it`s trying to be a film that it isn`t.|0
I love the TV contest. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented contestants. It's a shame that only 2 will be picked. I love watching the judges also. At times they are as entertaining as the contestants. I have been watching the show faithfully every Sunday night. Wouldn't miss it for the world. It's the best reality show that's ever been on television. Good luck to all the contestants, though I have already chosen the two who I would like to see play Danny and Sandy on Broadway.|1
I will admit, I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film, and after about 5 - 10 minutes into it, I felt like many did. I was expecting a Monkey movie that was similar to the television show, but instead I was given... well, I didn't know what I was given to be honest.However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.|1
"When the Romulans come , they will not be bearing gifts ; no , they bring with them war - war that the federation and earth cannot win with the way things are. The United Federation of planets has to change - it needs to change for the good of earth and its people. But how far are the Federation willing to go for change? Chapter 1: War, war and only war

"First of all , around the time I wrote this comment , I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written in the above post , and I was thinking about it, and it made sense to me , as I have already read and heard the word , and I understand what it means . But now , I just re-read my first comment , and I find it funny now , because my first thought was ""What if he means the opposite ? "", but that is not it. So now I want to ask a question : Can someone help me understand this , what if he meant the opposite ?"|0
"As far as I know I 've seen most of Lucio Fulci 's films , with the exception of some titles like ""Casa Aperta"" -"" Open House""- and his early ""Gialli"" thrillers. But as I'm planning to see ""Murder Rock "" this week-end I had the curiosity to check this film which I already have in my "" to watch "" list. I didn't expect a great deal from it since it seems like one of these cheap productions of the time. But it turns out that it is actually a good and interesting film, and one of Fulci 's best early films !"|0

For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings, who love film, have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny, smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you.For those with a poor attention span, high expectations and no brains.. well.. um.. you may get bored and find things dragging at times.This is a charming, modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles. I chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through..This film is a little gem.|1
It took me a while to find this movie since they do n't have it yet on DVD ( and they will not for a while ) but at least I have it now so I can enjoy it over and over again ! I loved the book, I think it's the best John Grisham's book. The movie was a bit different but still very interesting. I have to tell you it is soooooo frustrating when they change some of the plot of the books. I think they change a bit more than the usual.|0
"I first saw ""Signs of Life"" on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation. It's a wonderfully written, ensemble production with terrific performances by Michael Lewis as Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother, Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close. The rest of the cast which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary-Louise Parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters.The direction is subtle and effective. I've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it."|1
The `` old dark house '' sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the film many decades later. It's no surprise why the sub-genre took off, and became so wildly popular. It's got everything: romance, mystery, suspense, and plenty of dark places for the hero and heroine to escape to when they feel a little threatened. In fact, the only thing it seems to lack these days, is a good-looking and capable hero. And even then, I think I know of a couple of examples in that area as well.|0
If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost ( for many years ) gem , I recommend it without a second thought. This is what music is all about , no bullshit , just great tunes. It's not about what the singer or the guitar player is wearing or the color of the vinyl. It is about the song and this album has some really great ones !!!!!!! I am so pleased with this find, because it is one of those records I have listened to for so long and I never knew what band was behind this great album.|0
"Ah the Outer Limits. I love that show. It was surpremely creepy, or down-right mysterious. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to thriller to mystery, whatever the genre, it was good. I guess I must have started watching way after it got canceled, when Sci-fi showed it as re-runs, or played marathons of it. It was a really good show, I don't know all about the seasons and everything but I do remember that every time I saw the screen freak out and the voice on the TV say: ""There is nothing wrong with your television."|1
Who ARE the people that star in this thing ? Never heard of them ! ! But this is one of those movies that makes me laugh everytime I see it or even hear it, no matter if there is an opening or closing line or not. I always love a good spoof, and this is certainly a GOOD one !!! Oh and I have the soundtrack to it, it is really cool and has a bunch of songs that would be considered to be alternative. I love this movie so much, I even bought it and watch it at least once or twice a week !|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 1800hrs) and I still watch it! I don't like the A-Team... I absolutely adore them!! It is just great to see Justin chasing the former members of A-Team. Brings back memories from the old days, when I was young an sweet. I would have given you a 10 for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing the former A-Team members all by himself. Of course, that is the only bad thing on this documentary.|1
No. I'm not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don't Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm.|1
It was a terrific movie ! I like to watch it again and again . The actors were awesome . This one is definitely one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. I like to watch it again and again. I love the idea of a human becoming a superbeing and fighting for his life and against the odds to save his girlfriend. I have seen it a number of times and enjoyed it all each time i watch it. I also like the idea of the scientist turning into the superhuman to fight the supernatural. That is awesome and i really admire this creativity.|0
Containing Billy 's famous humor , this more modest comedy with heavy bittersweet overtones is a big departure , pleasantly, from the earlier works. The film is about a widower (Billy) who discovers that his son has become gay and is about to be married. He has a hard time accepting his son 's choice and inadvertently becomes the object of his gay friends ' mockery. As the son tries to make his father comfortable with the idea, the father begins to get a bit more accepting. However, the wedding takes place at an Episcopal church, but the Bishop won 't let any gays marry in the church.|0
"The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave . I 'm happy with that , but , as time went by , those ""Scream clones"" started having a negative impact on this new genre . First, we had a whole bunch of sequels , but , most of all , it's hard to even count how many Scream copies we had , and we 're still having them . That's where I lost faith in horror . Nowadays I can't bring myself to watch a single horror flick that 's called ""the new scream"" ."|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves . Season two 's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the first season's finale. It left you on the edge of your seat. And the first episode of season three does not disappoint . It opens up with the rescue of one of the characters. And it ends with something that will have the rest of the season in turmoil . Season three is just as captivating as the first two. And you will not be dissapointed if you have the time to watch the whole thing .|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films . It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation. It's a true family film , the youngest in our house loves watching it (and she isn't the only one!) It's a great film to show your kids if they ever get a bit disgruntled that you wouldn't buy them something they've asked for. They'll soon change their minds when you show them this. It is a great family film, I remember when I was a child I loved watching The Goonies as well.|0
I just ca n't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense . It was never supposed to make sense . And that's why it is so much fun. There is plenty to like about the story . There is plenty to like in the characters. There is plenty to like in the setting. And there is plenty to like just because the story is ridiculous and over the top. I don't like the 2004 movie version at all. If you've been to London you'll appreciate the fact that they really made an effort to get the locations just right.|0
Really , This movie should be released to DVD . I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was the movie. I really enjoyed it and was very much disappointed when it went off . I've just seen this movie on TV (Rai 2 on 24/08/2011), I loved it, even if the end is a real cliché! Anyway, I've just found your blog, and your blog is very interesting, especially for me, since I love the '80s as well! I like the idea of this movie. I really did.|0
I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson's hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce.|1
I don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while I did. I got so engrossed I gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted. And I sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show, but I was crying at the end. A lot of emotional nuance. Great acting, and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and the guy who played Luke was really good too. Highly recommend.|1
The `` all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... '' scene was a riot . I was just wondering why you never heard of her again? She must have had great comedic chops. I always assumed the same thing, and was surprised that she didn't have a longer career. I believe she also had roles in a handful of other films, which I don't recall right off the top of my head. I'm very happy that TCM chose to feature her in the last year. She was one of the most memorable people that appeared.|0
I 'm not a massive Disney fan , but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them. This is one of the few times he has asked me to see a film and I wasn't disappointed. The kids at school loved this movie , so did I. It had lots of funny and clever bits, great script, great animation and great action. If you liked the first, you'll like this one too. Not bad, a little disappointed by it compared to the first, it's still very good but not quite up to par with the first.|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I 've just managed to watch this film for the second time since its release. I do not think anyone can say this is a great film or even a good one, but it has an interesting concept and a few interesting scenes. First, the plot: A small village in the North of England in 1924. The main protagonist and narrator is a little girl (Aisling O'Sullivan) who is in a coma after having fallen from a tree in the garden of a large old house, which is inhabited only by an old woman (Dervla Kirwan).|0
David Attenborough brings his fascination of wild life , this time the creatures under the sea , in this extraordinary 2-DVD set. We learn about the evolution of the different types of fish and other creatures, and their adaptations and habits in different environments. We get up close to dolphins and whales, turtles, manta rays, eels, coral, crabs, and many other species of marine life. Attenborough takes you on a dive under the sea and shows us what we'd only dreamed about. The underwater camera work is simply amazing.|0
"Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground, and in particular the ""flowering"" of one of them. An embittered, ""Spike""-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings."|1
"Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates ""Separate Lies,"" a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it's the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their house on the night they have a party brings the police around. It is a hit and run that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett) husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage on his car."|1
Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time . Excellent original music , clever , heady ... it’s definitely worth a few re-visits over time . Very happy that I got the 2 disc set and that it contains an audio commentary . I think the commentary might be the funniest feature of the film !!!! I’d be curious if anyone knows if this film or any of the others from the series is available to stream on any service ? I have yet to find it . I don’t have a Prime account , but I do own the movie .|0
Just as in `` Columbo '' we see the fatality occur right at the beginning . What follows is an investigation. This time though, there is no murder or crime and no detective is needed. It is a case of uncovering the facts of a past event. It is a fact that in 1969, on January 12th, that the Apollo 11 crew of the first moon landing, the most publicized event of that time, were caught in an accident on the launch pad in which three men lost their lives. This is also a fact that this is the first ever attempt at landing a man on the moon.|0
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Implausible scenerios! Ridiculous death scenes! Creepy, evil-for-no-reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie just might be the best 30 minutes ever put on film, especially in the scene where the decent, hardworking citizens string chains across the street, knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them, only to be joined by the neighborhood children (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She's sweeping out the scum!|1
"To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.This was as their series was starting to end and the Monkees were starting to move towards their solo careers and recording their own songs for their upcoming record. Head was released at the same time the Monkees' last album of the 1960's, ""Headquarters."" The 1968 album would be the only one to have every member of the band having a song that was written or co-written with the band members themselves. ""Head"" is an art movie in the sense of Andy Warhol's movies."|0
The Child 's Play series is n't a favourite of mine , but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This is the only Chucky movie I will ever love , the rest is meh. Chucky is still a little creepy to me and the way he moves around and the way he speaks. The rest of the characters are cool and the effects are good but the rest of the story and characters aren't. It was a cool idea though to bring back Chucky for this sequel. I love the Child 's Play series .|0
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918. In fact, it is now more available with two other medium sized silent Chaplin features (A DOG'S LIFE, and THE PILGRIM) that Chaplin re-released in the 1950s. In it's day SHOULDER ARMS was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach. It still is very funny (Chaplin in disguise as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so ridiculous it's hysterical), but it suffers from being set in it's own age.|1
"Films belonging to the ""film noir"" genre usually contain similar elements: a ""deus ex machina"" plot twist that drives the main character headlong into bedlam, a pretty but psychotic girl, a handsome but psychotic thug, lots of money, lots of brutality, and usually a denouement in the desert. Think ""High Sierra"" or ""White Heat. ""There is plenty of hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But when film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives.It is this latter tradition that ""Blind Spot"" belongs to."|1
`` D.O.A '' is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish . Dennis Quaid is at his smoldering best in his role as a police sergeant in Canada, who after a night of heavy drinking , wakes up in a small motel bed with the girl who has just broken up with him. The rest of the film is a mystery that unravels itself as the hours pass and the girl's whereabouts remain unaccounted for. Director Louis Malle's film is an engaging mystery with strong performances from the entire cast (including a great cameo appearance by Angus Scrimm).|0
This interesting film noir features three very good performances : Sanders , Patrick , and Blackmer . The scenes between Sanders and Blackmer are the highlight of this movie, which has a great plot . Sanders plays a gangster whose brother is murdered , he goes to his old home town , and is framed for a murder , but escapes to the town to solve the mystery . He teams up with an old friend , who is now a police captain , and together they try to solve the murder . If you like old movies and a good film noir this movie is highly recommended .|0
A labor of love. Each frame is picture perfect and grabs you. Then the sheer emotion and story-telling take you through a dream that stays with you long after the movie. The director gets your heart and leads it through 100 minutes of visual poetry. You are a part of the emotional ride of the characters. I have seen this movie at 2 festivals and it got with standing ovations at every showing. The remarkable story-telling transcends nationality and language and I felt I was a part of the drama unfolding before me. The casting is as perfect as one can get.|1
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father, Louis Kahn, dead since 1974. The film builds slowly, but perfectly, and what starts out as a seemingly lost fortysomething's identity crisis unfolds into a beautiful tale with much deeper meaning with regard to the importance of love, loss, family and perhaps more importantly, our life's work.I had never heard of Louis Kahn prior to this film, although I was vaguely familiar with some of his work.|1
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars (The Monkees and Victor Mature), or its director/co-writer (Bob Rafelson), but also its other co-writer (and brief cameo) Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them seem to shun it, and to outsiders the movie is regarded, at best, as a curio.While the T.V. series was famously based on the antics of the Beatles' 'Help! ', this film is also judged by the same accord. Yet far from the trite and painfully overrated Beatles films, and even the dated Monkees T.V.|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat -- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a good sense of the era because his father worked in the oil industry during that time. This movie was great. The acting was very good. It wasn't until after seeing the movie that my son told me it was based on a true story. The characters were so funny and the script was witty and hysterical. I can see why this movie won the grand prize at the Cannes Festival in 2003. It was an amazing movie!|0
I thought Besson's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggles, triumphs, set backs, hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all. The film has a low budget and is obviously made without the glitz and glamour afforded to most Hollywood productions but that minimalism is what allows this film to transcend the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling and become a true drama. However calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot.|1
i did not read the book . nor do i care to . the movie was a beautiful romance , a little too much drama but it was beautiful . the ending was heartbreaking , but it was worth it . i did not see any other review that said it was so sad . i'm glad i had a tissue to dry the tears. the ending could have been very bad but i thought it was an excellent ending . i will buy this dvd . i can hardly wait for the movie that is coming in the next few weeks .|0
"The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special ""Simpson's Roasting On An Open Fire"" which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes, but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better. This episode centers around Bart who in this episode swaps on a test from Martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted, this leading to Bart mending his friendship with his Dad and losing all of his mates. The Episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out."|1
Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But, other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist.|1
"The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 ""They Made Me a Criminal."" Celebrating a ring victory in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield emotes about his love of mom, rejection of booze and clean living style to fans, including cops, who eat it up. Later in the evening he's plowed and tussling with his bimbo gal while his manager, in on the con, shares the evening. And the whiskey.A problem develops when another couple arrives. The guy is a newspaper reporter and he says he'll expose Bradfield's phony life on the front page."|1
It 's just that . Chucky 1 was good . Chucky 2 was better . Chucky 3 sucked . Now that I've seen part 4 I wish I'd never been born. I don't know what to do with my life . It's really hard to know where to start with this one . I can't believe how bad it is . I knew it was bad before I started watching but I had no idea it was going to be as bad as it is . There's very few things that are fun about this movie . It's just awful .|0
These critics need to find a new job!!! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY, which has made history. It illustrates beautifully how even in the mist of war and tragedy love can conquer all. The breathtaking Chephallonia of Greece has captured my heart and soul as if I too were there. The Blue eyed Cage & the delightful Cruz were amazing! Together they perfectly portrayed how a Mediterranean couple can only become closer in the time of war. This movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it!!! !|1
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences, its not like its the usual done and tried path. the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing. Justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech.|1
"A very suspenseful giallo from the director of ""L'Anticristo""(1974),this one begins with a brilliantly-handled sequence involving a priest,a little girl,and a broken doll.However the main story is about maniac(David Warbeck)marrying a traumatized cripple to kill her for her money.The plot,whilst not original,is really suspenseful,the acting is good and there are several skillful and gory murders.The score by Francesco de Massi is quite effective,some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulci's ""The New York Ripper""(1982).Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!"|1
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time, when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series.|1
* May Contain Spoilers * The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was in my early teens. I didn’t like it then, and I don’t like it now. But I do understand why it was nominated for an Oscar. This was one of the first films of its time with an anti-war message. It’s based on a book by E.M. Forster (who wrote A Room With A View), that was adapted for the screen by Noel Coward.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons, and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out. I must admit, season one is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in season one.The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get Bart ready for an intelligence test he needs to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he needs to. He spells out a word that angers Homer and he chases Bart around the house.|1
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks his engagement to Kitty and runs off to Craven Castle in Scotland. After several months Kitty and her aunt venture off to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle Kitty finds that Gerald has aged and he has grown meaner. Gerald has certain rules for the castle(the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay but, Kitty insist on staying by making excuses. One night her aunt catches a glimpse of the monster running across the hall.|1
If we could have `` Separate Tables , '' why not `` Separate Lies . `` This becomes somewhat involved because we are not only dealing with `` separate tables '' , but with the fact that there are many tables with `` separate heads . '' What I mean is that each individual is not dealing with his own separate lies . This is the case, for instance, with a wife or a husband who is keeping up a certain front with his spouse, and quite another front with a third party . It would be wrong to say that there is only one set of lies -- the family set .|0
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house. It's a very positive and happy type of music. The movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly kept on going even tho his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly didn't give up on what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut).|1
"I ca n't say how many times that one line has made me laugh or how often I 've described myself as ""that crazy cat lady."" I 've never owned a dog. My mother raised dogs. I was a kid in an adult body when I finally got my own place and it was a kitty haven. But I love dogs. I love seeing them running and playing together, snuggling on the couch and just hanging out. For the most part, I 've been able to see other people 's dogs, but not be around them too much."|0
it 's a great movie for the whole family . i do n't think many people have seen it cause it was not that popular when it was made but it is a must see! it 's a family movie but with lots of action and romance. it 's a very good movie, i really enjoyed watching this movie! This movie was really interesting, the love story between a girl and a man who had never seen woman and was very different from his world. It was such a good movie, even though I'm not a big fan of drama movies I really enjoyed it.|0
This is a brilliant film . The story starts off in Romania , where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who is trying to help a young Jewish boy who wants to get into the USA . It is during his stay in Romania that he falls in love with a local girl and has to decide whether to stay or go. The film then moves on to the USA where the agent and the boy have now been granted entry . In the USA they meet up with the boys sister who wants him to help her get out of Romania .|0
"If you get a chance to get a hold of this lost (for many years) gem, I doubt you will be disappointed. PS has an odd blend of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation-- even hints of slapstick, but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time, nothing has been seen like it since.I strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated, especially with Spike Lee's ""Bamboozaled"" (SP?) a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message. (Good filmmaking, disjointed script."|1
What a surprise . A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor ' only naughtier . Funny guy Martin Lawrence is back as techno-wiz Sherman . But this time instead of shrinking down into a giant ape he turns into a woman to woo his dream woman Carla . But can he pull the trick off without getting found out ? In 1986 the first 'Nutty Professor ' starring Jerry Lewis was released . And it still remains as a good film . Now 16 years later and Martin Lawrence has taken over the reins from Mr. Lewis . Is this remake of the old film as funny ?|0
I went to the pre-screening of `` Rory O'Shea Was Here . '' I like this movie better than I think it is. The film tells a boy and his friend who is paralyzed. It tells you the life story of people with disability and the relationship with his friends. I think I have seen the actor with this film but I don't remember what is the movie title. I watched the documentary film about the story about the 21 year old man with autistic spectrum disorders and 30 years old man with autistic spectrum disorders. In the documentary film, they show us their life with their parents.|0
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing!|1
This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Top 20 of my lifetime. I laughed more than I have since Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and cried more than I have since I saw The Notebook. If you are looking for a touching movie without the sappy edge...this is the one. It is real and powerful. See it and you won't regret it. I was reluctant at first and I only watched it because I had to do a school project about speech disabilities. But this movie is so much more than that.|1
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie , this wo n't be one for you . If , however , you are looking for a very realistic movie that deals with some of the problems that we face as Americans , then this movie is definitely one to see. The movie stars Denzel Washington , Chris Pine ( of the latest "" Star Trek "" film ) , Rosario Dawson ( from the ""Sin City"" movies ) , Ethan Suplee , Kevin Dunn , and Kevin Corrigan . The movie concerns an unfortunate incident in the lives of four men: Ray , Deke , Frank , and Tuck ."|0
I do n't care what some of the reviews said , this movie was funny . The thing with this film , just like most comedies , when you really get into it , you laugh even harder than the first time . You really have to see this film for yourself . It's an interesting twist of events and a good film to see . The cast is brilliant , they all work well together , they have a good chemistry . This film was a very entertaining film , a good cast , a good director , and good comedians make this film the funniest movie I've seen this year .|0
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live . I know personally most of the actors and people involved . It is very close to the real story , and the people involved . I loved it , even the music and the ending is great. We all have to remember and respect what these brave men went through and did . Very well done and I recommend it for sure . Thank you so much for watching, it is a pleasure to see all the beautiful comments from the people here in the UK and the world!|0
"Gary Busey 's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography . Since had a musical background , he was able to play Buddy Rich in a very convincing fashion. I was fortunate to see him do a few shows at the Beverly Hills Supper Club and was impressed at how he stayed ""in character"" all night. The film has some minor flaws, but the film is a must see for Buddy Rich and drum enthusiasts. The story is a little disorganised, but I think it gets its message across. Also, I think that the actor who played Buddy Rich should have practised a little more on his drumming!"|0
WTF!! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending?? The Notebook was good...but sheesh, enough with the depressing endings already. I'm told that he writes about realistic situations that people deal with in real life. Understandable...but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives to only get to a mediocre unhappy time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to live it out for the rest of their days. Don't we already know what really happens in real life?|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it's never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand's growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate.|1
A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries (Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island) that keeps many of the novel's characteristics. I think that greek sceneries add something special and magical to a movie. One thing i didn't like at all though, is that the main characters, like 'Mandras' and Pelagia's father weren't greek actors but foreigners. I mean the actors tried to express the greek way of living, but to me they didn't succeed and it was quite clear. Even their pronunciation when they were trying to use greek words was terrible and that was bad for the film's plot.|1
Final Solution is a powerful christian film that shows the hate between the black and whites that was present in South Africa during the times of apartheid. The film is written and directed by Daniel Krige. The movie is a very emotional film that teaches people to overcome the hate that is between them. The movie is about how the hatred of black and white people is affecting their children and causing violence to occur in their communities. The film starts off with a white family that is moving in with another family because they believe their children are going to be murdered.|0
I 've got to say it . Gary Busey saved this film . If it were not for his fine performance , it would not have gotten me to watch it twice . It was a pretty decent story . I am not sure it really needed to have been a two parter , but it's nice to have 45 more minutes of some great acting . If you missed Part 1 when it first aired , catch the replay . I would think you would be pleased to know that this is a very good story and well worth your while .|0
"I 've commented once on this Chucky great , but I had to do it again to say some things that are really relevant to me. As I've said earlier, I'm 28 years old , I've had a lot of relationships, I have dated guys with really big egos, arrogant and narcist guys, that just want you around for your body and for your money. I can tell that Chucky is the man for me. We started our relationship as ""just fun"" and ended up going out for a year and 5 months."|0
What a surprise this film was . I 've seen a good few of Fulci 's horror and zombie flicks . But this one was totally different . It starts off in the usual fashion , A couple go to their friends villa and it turns out the place is run by a satanic sect . From here the plot starts to veer off on a whole new path as the couple are kidnapped by the sect . It's not a straight forward zombie movie and the plot goes into some very dark and disturbing areas . Some of the rituals are very disturbing and the effects are quite nasty .|0
"A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of ""The English Patient,"" even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff. In ""A Passion in the Desert,"" the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks."|1
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time . Quickly the movie grabbed my attention with its interesting story. It is a story about a father who wants to be reunited with his daughter but the problem is she believes he is dead. The story is about the lengths her father will go to just to spend some time with his little girl . This is the type of film that makes you believe in the supernatural. It is a well written film and is a perfect film for anyone who is a fan of the supernatural.|0
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still I enjoyed it. This time, Charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them. Death Wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and I enjoyed it every single second of it. Director Michael Winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and Jimmy Page providing the music, with producers Golan and Globus still doing there thing and Charles Bronson is still acting good for Paul Kersey.|1
`` Nuovomondo '' was a great experience . Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue . In the case of this film , it's very rare that the characters speak . They speak a little , just to express the need to be heard and then they become quiet . This makes the film very different from many films that I know . This makes you feel as if you are hearing the soundtrack of the characters' lives and not their words. This is very powerful . The images are very important .|0
This is one of Chaplin's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More opulent than the Mutual films, it continues Chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression. Most people forget that the film is actually a dream that Charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front.There is plenty of slapstick via the Limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree.By this stage in this career, the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves.|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I adore my country and I liked the flattering director's point of view. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on her own two feet through war, Nazis and hardship. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love but the times are hard and they have a lot of sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage looking great in a uniform gives a passionate account of this unfulfilled (in the beginning) love.|1
"Without going into any details of a good...if a somewhat provocative...TV movie, there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is ""no one to blame here"".I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes may be young and horny (and good looking) because he's not getting as much as he wants from mom, that doesn't mean, he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter. OK, he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her, but I don't buy it."|1
"What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode , beside Peter Falk , you have Julie Newmar , Beverlee McKinsey , Richard Kiley and a lot of big name actors , this is a great Columbo movie
It was good to see an episode that wasn't really a 'whodunit' but rather was an episode where we knew who did it and how, but rather why. I also enjoyed the little nods to the 60s culture. I'd like to see a whole episode done that way sometime, but still have a 'why' type mystery."|0
The film isn't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch. I am the first one to agree that Victor Fox isn't really that attractive and his music and style are pretty cheesy. I also agree that the film has some odd distractions and some scenes don't work well. So what? If it makes you smile and you enjoy it who cares? Does every film have to make sense? Does every film have to be perfect? No. A person could get razed admitting that they love this film. Again, so what?|1
I love this movie , though I do n't like how they picture Egyptians , being an Egyptian citizen myself I have to say it 's not completely true how Egyptians live. I'm not a fan of the movie , because of its inaccuracies , but its really good story and it has a really good ending , even if a little bit predictable. One of the worst movies ever. Awesome!! I loved this movie so much! I love this movie and I've always been a big fan of Egypt and the Pharaohs since I was a young child .|0
Some days ago , in Rome , a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a 23 years old Italian woman, he then dismembered her body and tried to burn it , he was later arrested on the border of Switzerland to Italy. The young man, who lived in an immigrants house of Rome , had been reported to the police and the authorities for previous criminal offences. His nationality and his legal status in Italy, however , was still under investigation , but according to some reports , he was an illegal immigrant with no papers, but not a Romanian.|0
"In an early scene, Luca (David Pasquesi) and James (Jeff Garlin) are walking down a neighborhood street in Chicago, admiring the bucolic architecture, when a woman, angrily arguing in French on a cell phone, passes by them, prompting James to remark, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry French woman."" A few blocks later, they pass an old Filipino woman, also angry, also arguing on a cell phone, and Luca remarks, for referential effect, ""There's nothing hotter than an angry, elderly Filipino woman."|1
I 'm not going to go into too much depth , but Showtime was a pretty funny movie . There are some other funny moments , but nothing special . The cast was a pretty good one and the movie is fun , but just not as good as the trailers make it sound . This is the type of movie you watch on a rainy day , but not something you really want to go out of your way for . It's also not a movie that you will want to watch over and over again , but it is something you can watch once for a good time .|0
"This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best one.Death Wish 3 reminds me of ""West Side Story"" with a new twist. Not even the recent flick ""Gangs of New York"" can measure up with one New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs---but one big gang. A gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set.Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays gently in this action-packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot-em-up violence."|1
Blind Spot's images are great. The action draws you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits all that you can think about are the film's positive high-points. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heart-wrenching. The film score is nicely understated . Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the engrossing narration and terrific visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this film. It delves into some dark territory but you come out of the tunnel seeing nothing but white light.|1
Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content.|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I've ever seen. Not only it's the mother of coincidence, but also every time that you think you can set up the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction.Take this casualty for example, The US marine, whom gives Sayid the way to become a Torturer, Is Clancy Brown, playing a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he is playing Kelvin Inman, the Desmond partner in the Hatch. Destiny, uh?|1
I always liked this movie, I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I have to disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what was that :P They don't look that way in Romania.. Anyway, back to the story, Ghita Muresan played pretty well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. And there were some funny moments and some tragical/sad parts too. It worths being seen, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love.|1
"A nice and pleasant movie full of meditteranean sceneries ( Cephallonia is a very beautiful greek island ) that keeps the viewer interested and makes him want to see what happens next. It is really worth seeing. The two main characters are interesting and attractive. There is also music in the movie which also makes the whole thing a little bit more special. A good choice. A really good film. I don't care about people who dislike it because of the ""sappy ending"" or the so called ""unrealistic"" parts. This is a fairy tale."|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I'm Dancing'... i didn't know a thing about it, so had no preconceptions before i went in.The film is about two guys who are confined to their wheel chairs, and live in a home. Michael (Steven Robertson) suffers from Cerabal Palsy and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from Muscular Dystrophy (please excuse any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, as Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying.|1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children at large. Add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema  a madwoman, a newspaper reporter, ineffectual police, a sexy siren, a priest, a mute girl, a mentally-retarded loner etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.Unusually for a giallo, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle.|1
Gary Busey's best performance in a nicely-flowing biography. Since had a musical background, he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see that fine actor, Don Stroud (one of the crickets) and Charlie Martin Smith as well.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Gary Busey. Thankfully, Mr. Busey was Oscar-nominated for this, losing to Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A fairly low-budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with GREAT SONGS by Mr. Holly. I hope this made plenty of dough.|1
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships.|1
"Remember that this came out before Gulf War I, which gave us Werner Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"".Le Dernier Combat is not ""Sci Fi"". It's more like Judgment. I've watched it at least a dozen times. It really is a fitting companion to Herzog's ""Lessons of Darkness"": ""And in that time, men will seek death, but they will not find it, for death will flee from them. ""That someday, alas, may be today, in Iraq."|1
Yes , at times `` Unconditional Love '' overwhelms as it bounces -- no , as it ricochets -- from us , towards us . And if we are open to it , the rush of it can be the most powerful and beautiful thing that we will ever experience . And that's all we really have , really , to give , in return , to those we care about . The only thing we can control , really , is our actions and reactions -- our behavior and our attitudes . And the greatest gift we can give to anyone who means anything to us is unconditional love in return .|0
I 've never seen the original `` House Of Wax '' so I really did n't know what to expect when I heard that Warner was releasing the movie. I knew the story was similar but I was still looking forward to the film. What a disappointment. I know horror movies usually don 't make great money at the box office, but you would think they would try and put out good films that at least would have a chance at a profit. Now the cast was not terrible, but the plot was boring.|0
Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist's rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents.|1
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange. I was confused, sad and happy in the same moment. I guess that too less people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their suffers of bodily disability, whom (as a team) beat the medical well-fare system and fight for their rights. This movie shows a side which some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotional presented.|1
"(Some spoilers included:)Although, many commentators have called this film surreal, the term fits poorly here. To quote from Encyclopedia Britannica's, surreal means:""Fantastic or incongruous imagery"": One needn't explain to the unimaginative how many ways a plucky ten-year-old boy at large and seeking his fortune in the driver's seat of a red Mustang could be fantastic: those curious might read James Kincaid; but if you asked said lad how he were incongruous behind the wheel of a sports car, he'd surely protest, ""NO way!"""|1
The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino ( `` The Antichrist '' , `` The Killer is on the Phone '' , `` House of Exorcism ''), this spaghetti thriller is a blend of spy film and giallo, with all the hallmarks of the director's penchant for twisty storylines and inventive camera work. A woman, who believes she has been poisoned, has her blood tested and it reveals traces of a rare and fatal blood disorder. To save herself from death she has a series of transfusions from different donors, all of which are incarcerated at a top-secret prison in Switzerland.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years.. there's been lame remakes, attempts to make you scared (when all they make you do is walk out of the theater) and movies that just shouldn't have been made. but this one is worth it. the only reason i didn't give it a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but her death scene makes up for it, believe me)....so here they are.. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie..1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton's!|1
where do we go from here? that is the overriding question of this film. And make no mistake, 'mainly ETC. ', the 2003 effort from director john jansen, asks far more questions than it answers, but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one.much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies, and I'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer.|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a film? Probably someone. But no-one, truly no-one, could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly emotive and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film.Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in a home for disabled people. He has Cerebral Paulsy, and as shown to us right at the beginning, he has huge trouble communicating. So it truly is a lifeline when fellow disabled member Rory (James McAvoy) who can speak normally, understands him.|1
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail.|1
"NOBODY ( 1999 ) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir . It 's about three salarymen who get in a lot of trouble and end up going to prison . There the three become fast friends, but only to a point. There are some great moments in the movie especially when the three friends finally get released from prison and try to "" start over again "" , but they have a lot of explaining to do to there families. It's a shame that this isn't more well known or available in the states . There's some amazing camera shots in this film too ."|0
where do we go from here ? that is the overriding question of this film . And make no mistake this is a film about questions . The questions are many and varied , but all deal with the issue of identity and in particular the identity of the modern African woman. The questions are asked of a panel of four women. They are of different nationalities and generations but in general they all agree on the major issues of their lives as African women. The discussion takes place at the end of an exhibition of contemporary African art which has for its central theme issues of identity.|0
This is one of my favourite Disney films. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a nasty villain and lots of adventure. The story begins in Paris, where aristocat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is perfect for them until the Mistress' fiendish butler Edgar discovers that she plans to leave her entire fortune to the cats. He realises that if he even stands a chance of claiming the fortune, the cats will be out of the way.|1
James Franco is totally cool in this movie . Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in this very sensitive role of a gay teacher. We all are aware of the controversy this film was embroiled in right after its premier during the Toronto Film Festival 2011 , when an actor named James Deen claimed that during the filming of a simulated sexual assault , Franco forced him into it . Franco responded with a letter in the LA Times , stating that the scene was not simulated but that Deen was fully aware of what was expected of him.|0
After learning that her sister Susan is contemplating divorce, Kate decides to travel to the distraught woman's remote country home and spend some time with her. When Kate arrives, however, Susan is nowhere in sight. That's because someone has murdered her and stuffed the body in a trunk in the basement. As a storm rages outside, Kate tries to figure out where her sister could have gone and places her own life in great danger...the killer is still on the premises! In her first post-BEWITCHED vehicle, Elizabeth Montgomery gives a solid dramatic performance.|1
I'm not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn't any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it's moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn't explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars' (Eddie Murphy's) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell.|1
This is Christmas time! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least this is what can be hoped regarding the Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that the Italian cinema didn't craft an art piece of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can be also regarded at the same level of quality as the Italian masterpieces of the past, needless to quote any name. And finally this is also a big production for Italian standards of the time. In this movie there is a rare balance of different elements, all of them understandable and enjoyable at different levels of fruition.|1
"Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos. The character created and portrayed by Sacha Baron-Cohen on Channel Four's daft-but-deliberate-as-a-deliberate-thing ""Da Ali G Show"" has also been a hit in the States. In the film, which is based on Baron Cohen's television series, the wannabe gangsta rapper / wannabe interviewer / would be journalist / would-be tyrant Ali G (Cohen again) heads to America to ""do some interviiwin' wif 'n' 'sploding peoples brains and shit"" (in other words to interview celebrities and other public figures)."|0
Right this may be the wine talking but this could be the best movie I've seen in a very long time. Granted I spent much of the first half an hour wondering what the hell was going on but once I had accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles I was able to enjoy the film.Can you really hate a film where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate over the enemy? What does character development matter when faced with a lesbian alien princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does Buddha wear seriously blinging diamond earrings?|1
"This movie may be the best ever if you like watching movies and laughing and then subjecting your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me, and you probably are, you'll be laughing for years to come at the jokes in this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus sharks some money off a guy with kids and then the guy takes those kids into the forest like Hansel and Gretel then he and his wife go home with them. The soup scene kitchen is rife with comic genius of buffoonery: ""Inspection officer -- Here!"""|1
This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast.|1
"the first time I saw this movie, I just thought ""what the hell?"" a 10-year-old kid driving around bizarre places, meeting bizarre people, going after a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I enjoyed this movie a lot!Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It's a shame he stopped act. He interprets very well his character Gus on the movie.Gus loses an eye, got tattoos and go at the most weird cities acting with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! Want more? OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why this movie needs one!?"|1
"1930's comedy mystery about ""The Crooked Circle"" a band of hooded crooks who set about plotting the murder of some one who swore to oppose them. Enjoyable but really unremarkable little film, the movie works simply because the cast headed by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom would later appear together in a couple of Hildegarde Withers films after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of that series) and supported by a great cast of actors and actresses you know but may not know the name of (I don't hence the lack naming)."|1
Lucio Fulci , later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie , was years earlier a respected Italian director with a taste for the macabre. He made a number of films featuring the supernatural and psychological thriller genres. This was the first of his films I saw as part of a double bill with Suspiria . This was the first film in a planned trilogy of which The New York Ripper would make up the third part. The film is not really about a cat , although it features a deadly feline. In this film, a cat is a symbol of bad luck and misfortune.|0
NIGHTS IN RODANTHE brings back to the screen two talented actors in Diane Lane and Richard Gere in a simply beautiful story of a man and a woman hungry for something more in their lives than they have at present. The chemistry between Lane and Gere is magical from the first scene in the film to their last embrace. The locations, beauty of their attraction for one another when it unfolds when they first meet, and the story that follows, and as they begin to know each other with the attraction they feel towards each other is real, is romance that is projected to an audience with tender care.|1
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo' (hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door'), and was very impressed by both it's dreamy & occasionally surreal tale of a family that immigrates from Sicially to the U.S. in the early days of the 20th century. It also worked as a (proverbial)middle finger jammed into the eyeball of Homeland Security (preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle),in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land.|1
I 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer , and I 'm not disappointed. It's a great movie full of heart-stopping action and amazing special effects. It doesn't matter who you are, I think that you will enjoy this movie. The acting is well done, but it's the special effects that really carry the film. Don't miss this film. This movie is about a group of children who discover that their parents are monsters. The children are left to protect the earth from their evil parents, who are out to kill them.|0
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt, My parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and twilight zone (new and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone.|1
Chucky 's back ... and it 's about time ! This time , with the help of Jennifer Tilly and Katherine Heigl , he 's coming out of the computer and back to life to continue his murder spree ! The newest installment of the hit horror franchise brings Chucky to DVD for the first time. It 's the funniest film since the last one ! Chucky 's back on the rampage , and he wants more blood. As the only person who can put an end to the murderous rampage, Andy Barclay (Carrigan) teams up with Chucky 's original nemesis, his mom, to end his nightmare.|0
I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time , when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series as re-runs on the SciFi Channel (I think). These episodes have always impressed upon me, more than any other show, that science fiction can be really scary, with very intelligent storylines that can make you think and make you think about what could happen, not just with space exploration, but with how humanity deals with science and how it changes our lives, for good and for ill. The new Outer Limits does not have the same quality writing as the original series.|0
I was 19 or 20 , years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City , Utah and working for an electrical contracting company. I remember the date because it was a Monday evening, April 22nd, 1968 . I had just finished up my workday and as I drove home , I was listening to a popular radio station which was also the NBC affiliate channel 2. Suddenly the DJ stopped and informed the listeners that he had just heard the president of the United States was shot and he would bring us back up to date after a brief break.|0
"Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character, unable to speak, living in a world incompatible with modern life. He trusts to his homemade weaponry - helmet, sleeves, and spear - made out of hubcaps, seat cushions, and discarded office furniture. Just as Don Quixote rode Rocicante, ""The Man"" rides his contraption (literally) transcending the lost lives caught up the harsh and demeaning modern world - soaring above the earth, away from the plight of modern man. Both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the wrongs of the world."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously . I thought it to be one of the most original and entertaining movies in the thriller/horror genre to come out of Spain in some time. And since then I have been a huge fan and supporter of Adrián García Bogliano. So it was an honor to do this email interview. I hope you enjoy reading it! I started to become familiar with your work a few years back with Cold Sweats and I thought this was a very original, interesting movie.|0
Without going into any details of a good ... if a somewhat provocative ... TV movie , there seems to be something wrong with the system. There are so many people that I can think of who would make excellent judges that would do it for little, if any, money and for the honor. Would anyone care to suggest names? Cindy, I am not sure where you get the idea there are no good judges to serve in the US District Court in this country. There are many who are more than qualified and capable of handling the workload of a district court.|0
I thought Besson 's film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them: evoke emotion. Sofia: I think it's more interesting to play a part of somebody who's real and alive. Marc: I'm trying to convince you that I'm alive, but maybe that's a bit difficult. Gabriel: If I don't let you go now, I will forever regret it. I love you and you're everything to me. But we'll never be together. Kate: What? You can't be here.|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job . He apparently never had any acting experience before and you would never have known it. I wonder who this man is? I hope you are still alive and doing well. I have enjoyed your strip poker scene several times since it was originally uploaded. I have always been curious which actor portrayed the protagonist, JD Williamson. If it's true that he didn't have any acting experience beforehand, I think he should be congratulated for his role in this film. His performance was truly outstanding!|0
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then do n't watch this because you will not find any action here in the starting. In the initial 10 minutes of movie you will find only romantic scenes between Ranbir and Aishwarya but trust me the 10 minutes will worth spending. After first 10 minutes movie is totally different from the story of a boy and girl who fall in love with each other. It has some twist in it. The story is good but the screenplay is very poor and I have no words to explain that.|0
"Chucky (the murderous doll from ""Child's Play"" and 2 crappy sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using ""Voodoo for Dummies"") revives him. Then, through circumstances too convoluted to get into, SHE is killed and has her soul put into another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real people again...A lot better than it sounds."|1
Lost has been one of the most mesmerizing and thrilling experience I 've ever seen . Not only it 's the best show on television, it 's the best show on earth. And now, the series is over. I can 't imagine how many people would cry over it, because we have been through so many things with these characters over the last 6 years. The story is about these people who survived after a mysterious and disastrous air plane crash on an island. They are struggling to find out what 's really going on , and in this process, they come to realize themselves better .|0
`` Caribe '' is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects . However , it delivers a perfectly adequate adventure . If you are looking for a great adventure , you will probably leave disappointed. The plot is not very original or deep. The character development is average . However , if you're looking for an inoffensive adventure , that's it . I'm giving the game a score of 68% . I've always had good memories of Caribbean because the graphics and audio were amazing for their time, and I think it was one of the first adventure games to use full motion video.|0
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp, where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line. That's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight!Next thing you know he's in France in a trench. Hilarious scenes here include a starving Charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder.When Charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring.|1
As the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old , I adore AristoCats . It is such a well written movie that I can watch over and over and over again . AristoCats is a great movie for young children as they can learn from it. When it comes to kids movies, I really do enjoy them. It is my favorite thing to watch. It is also a great way for me to bond with my kids. I love when the little ones are so happy and excited to watch a movie, especially when it includes singing.|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film! Hat's off to Ben Daniels, Lavinia Currier and the great Honore de Balzac. This captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully. I watched it mesmerized, almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end. This film's execution was almost flawless: simple and pure, it plays with our hearts, guiding us in understanding the strange platonic, absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world.|1
I would say 'Bride of Chucky ' is a `` return to greatness '' but the series was never really that good to begin with. I would have to say that it was not as bad as the 4th one and is definitely better than the 5th. I would also like to say that it seems to me like all of the people involved with the 8th film, were the same ones who did the 5th. There is no denying the fact that this new film was made to look more like the first film and to get more money from the fans who would pay to see a film like that one.|0
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred."|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters. The other two films (both from the early 1900s) were ""A Night at the Theater"" (1915) and ""Sunday at the Races."" ## External links

Contrary to what many may believe as this movie being an `` against the system '' type of movie and having the typical Hollywood ending, this movie was a real eye-opener. The movie actually depicts what can happen when someone is put into jail with a drug charge. Not all drug charges should be in jail, and many people who end up in jail are innocent. If you read the comments of others who were put in this jail, it's obvious they have the mentality of prison guards. I am a nurse at this jail, and the movie did depict many things that happen on a regular basis here.|0
I love this movie a lot . I must get this on DVD . I have 2 VHS copies , one that is not very good because it is the only one I could get at the time but it is still very watchable . I wish they would do a special edition DVD of it , it is so deserving . I'd LOVE to have this on DVD. I just picked this up on dvd. It looks great, and I'm so happy I no longer have to watch the bootleg VHS tapes I've always had. They were old and the picture was a bit shabby.|0
The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical films of ALL TIME . Yep. The one with John Rubinstein. I love how the movie starts out as an old black-and-white silent film, then it switches to color and goes into Technicolor for the musical numbers. I have it on VHS. Were there ever plans for a Broadway version? I'm surprised there isn't any mention of that on here or at the official website. I was surprised to find out that a musical was made in 1973. I'd love to see it.|0
William H. Macy always gives a good performance . He never looks lazy and never seems like he 'd rather be somewhere else . He takes on all comers in his movies and makes us believe he can actually beat the crap out of some of these guys . It's always good when he's teamed up with other actors that can match his intensity . This movie has one other actor and he's good too . They really go at it in this one . It's about a young lady from a rough neighborhood that decides to give college a whirl .|0
When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would not have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done pretty well, except for Shakespere for English class...etc...I was still only watching things that ended happy. But then I saw Ramola Garai in Havanah Nights, which was cute, not good but entertaining enough to watch. After seeing this a few times over the two or so years since I first saw it, I grew to like it, especially the music.|1
Like some people here , I love/loved Stingers ! In Norway it got aired a lot later . That also made me fall for it more . I was so happy when they released it on dvd. Now I'm waiting for the last season . I was hooked from first episode. Great show, one of my favs. Ditto - one of my favorite series, and I never miss re-runs on Ion if I can see them. One of my all time favorites. It was a really great series, I think it was on TV here in the states for 5 seasons I think.|0
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy.|1
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time, and this film speaks volumes about how little everyone really knew. His son's desire to find out who, and more importantly what he was is moving, and emotional.This film captures the spirit of what architecture is really about, what good design is, and the emotional price that is paid for it. Equally haunting is the sound track. If you see the film, and then listen to the sound track you can revisit the film simply by listening.|1
I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies...She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair).|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, strikes him down dead, and keeps driving. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what consequences this murder will have on the rest of the village. Separate Lies is a very British movie indeed. I'm not saying that hit-and-run car accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone reacts to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectable citizen with a ""stiff-upper-lip"" attitude towards tragedy."|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon)."|1
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it . I found the whole thing rather frightening. It was very well done, however. Sounds like a good one. I'll keep my eye out for it. Haven't seen it in a while. But I always enjoyed it when it was on TV, and it was often shown on one of the BBC movie channels when the horror genre was on show. Never saw that one, but I'll keep my eye out for it! Andrew, you'll remember this one...I know I do.|0
This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience.|1
Between sweeping , extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded at the core, the film promises to bring in fresh air to the genre. The official release date is May 2nd, which means you can expect a teaser or a trailer coming in soon. This is not the first time that Dhanush is working with a Hollywood director – he had previously teamed up with director Robert Rodriguez (‘Sin City’) for the action thriller ‘Machete’, which was the fourth in the franchise.|0
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice . I read some of the reviews and then read the novel again to check. Mostly, I find that my own reviews are often different from those of the critics. I wonder if that is because I often read a book several times before reviewing it. In the novel Barnens ö (1995) we have a typical Strindberg story. He often wrote of unhappy love stories, unhappy marriages, unhappy children, unhappy families. Here we find a rather dysfunctional family.|0
I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got.|1
I thought it was brilliant ! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down . Dwight's wife is lovely .. and it was heartbreaking for them when she was so ill . I've been a fan from the very start and I've learnt loads more things about them and their family . And now it's come to an end . Sigh . I'm glad they've all done so well . I have watched several episodes and really enjoy it. There are some episodes on YouTube that you can watch. I really like Dwights wife a lot.|0
I watched this movie out of a lack of anything else on at the time. Quickly the movie grabbed me with the depth of the characters and subtle plot. I was quite surprised to see that the rating given by my satellite provider did not show any stars.I will not give any spoilers to the plot-line or outcome but most of the characters had at least some redeeming value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Frequently, you can pick-up the formula and predict a story direction.|1
"I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline. I go to the movies as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy a ""story"". I found this to be a good movie, not great, but good. It was worth my money and my tears :)Diane Lane was wonderful as always, Richard Gere isn't an over-actor. He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect. He brings his own style to the movie.I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told."|1
Well , I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning . So I decided to check out one that I thought might do just that. The film follows the story of three young boys who make a horrible discovery in the woods behind their home. While one boy runs home to tell his mother about what he has found, the other two boys find themselves being chased by the horrific creatures they have come across. As the mother goes out to find her son, she meets up with two young men who are also searching for the children.|0
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen! The images that are shown are absolutely breathtaking and stunning. On top of that, it is a wonderful learning experience. I'm not one for educational documentaries, but this one grabs hold of you and doesn't let go until the end. You'll be so hooked and entranced by what you are watching that you'll forget your at home watching TV! This series is available to buy on DVD and I HIGHLY recommend picking this one up!|1
My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever seen (and that we really should have known better). I still haven't made up for watching all those cheesy movies and shows, but we have a new rule now. If I can find a show or a movie on Netflix, it's a go. If you're a Netflix member (you can get a month free trial if you're not), or even if you are looking for a Netflix gift card to use, you'll find these 30 great movies worth watching.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience, told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships, I cannot imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this film.Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities.|1
"This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title ""The Chaplin Review"".This was an odd film in some ways because later in life, Chaplin was anti-war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood. This film, in contrast, is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the US efforts in WWI. It's truly odd to see Charlie as the ""super soldier"" who single-handedly captures 13 Germans, casually and coolly shoots several Germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the Kaiser himself!"|1
Let me clarify that . This is not a `` good movie '' , but I am so glad it came out and I am sure there are lots of people who like the movie. I am also sure some people won’t understand the movie, but this is not a movie for everyone. This is a movie that is for people who want to understand the reality of our situation as a society . If you don’t look at it with this kind of mind, it is just another action movie for you.|0
"The last film by underrated director Alberto De Martino (""The Antichrist"", ""The Killer is on the Phone"") is a truly suspenseful but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, containing pretty much all the trademarks that makes this Italian horror sub genre so magnificent and addictive to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, phony priests), loads of creepy moments, plot twists left & right, outstanding music and  last but not least  a handful of really sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is some kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror!"|1
First off , I absolutely loved this movie . As a Billy Crystal fan , I must say that I thought he did an outstanding job in this film . His character development was superb and I would definitely like to see a follow up with this character. This film would be appropriate for kids , teenagers and adults. It's one of those rare instances where you can all sit and enjoy the film without getting bored . There was plenty of humor , heartfelt scenes and even some touching scenes that I thought were very well done.|0
James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way. At the Tristan screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole James Dean thing but I don't think this true. Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent. In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely. It's a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his journal cut you like a knife. You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words.|1
The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he interviewed noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid, so he could get really honest answers from people... And it is very funny. So I didn't expect movie to be good, cause it was all acted - no real people or interviews. So the basic point of all show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I ever saw.|1
Who could have thought a non-disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely powerfully as a disabled person in a movie without any physical or mental handicaps. It is so powerful that you would almost forget that a non-disabled person was playing this role. This is almost a perfect film, and as a disabled viewer, it feels like being in a disabled person’s body. I loved it and have watched it 20 times. I can’t stop watching it. I had no idea what to expect from this movie, and was blown away.|0
Wow, What a wonderful film-making! Mr. Im has done it, again!His last work, ChunHayang (2000) was a great film, but this one is even greater. Selected as an official feature film in the Canne Festival for the second time in a two-year row, this 66 years old director is getting better and better at what he is making of with a Korean culture.Simply, Chihwaseon is about a great Korean painter, '(Ohwon) JANG, Seung-Up' who was considered as a prodigy in the late Nineteenth century.|1
By convincing the Prime Minister to back the totally unsuitable Ali G as a candidate for Staines in the local elections, the Lib Dems managed to lose a seat which they held by the thinnest of majorities to the Tories, who will now be sitting on 311 seats. At the moment there are three independents sitting as councillors, and there is little doubt that they will end up supporting Labour, thus handing Gordon Brown the keys to No10. The only saving grace is that Ali G doesn't get to be an MP until the new session of Parliament in June.|0
I have to admit I had never heard of this movie. I caught it last night on TMC. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed so hard and loved the ending. Image what a Marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all dropped LSD.Funny and edgy are two overused words these days, this movie sure has that plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot. I had to be up at 6:00 am and watched it until 2:30. I over slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a strong female protagonist makes me wonder what his films would be like if a woman were directing instead of a man. The answer, of course, would be better. Just like his films, this list is diverse in both style and content, with many different approaches to portraying the female experience. If you ever find yourself wondering what a world without men would be like, you can watch any of these and find out.|0
This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to 'f-bombs' every line. I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message.|1
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war . Everything about the movie was perfect . This movie showed how people can overcome any difficult situation by being brave . Everyone in this movie has played their roles perfectly . Vikram, Akshaye Khanna, Prabhu Deva and Sathyaraj all have done justice to their characters . The story of this movie is a bit different from the usual stories we have been watching . It has love and hatred , revenge and sacrifice . The director has beautifully put up the story . It was a great job to write such a wonderful story .|0
I didn't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD. I knew it had a cult following but I had also seen a lot of the director's later works which although delightfully gory were also pretty much incoherent. DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING actually had a linear storyline and a mystery that kept me guessing almost until the end. And after all was said and done, it was a genuinely unsettling and creepy experience. One major caveat: I would much rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles than the uneven dubbing found here.|1
What a surprise this film was. I've seen a good few of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director. He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed, complex story line. The dubbing on this is not good, but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like 'Manhattan Baby'.The photography in this film is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered.|1
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling, a skill that will come into full flower in later films like SHOCKING DARKNESS and THE PSYCHIC. There is no gore and almost none of the gruesome excess that will mark his later work, but even without these trademarks of his, the director's unique visual sense is clearly on display throughout. A woman (Barbara Bouchet of NIGHT HUNTERS) witnesses a murder but the killer (Rudolf Schundler of FULCI'S ZOMBI 3 and THE BEYOND) manages to escape.|0
So it 's not an award winner , so what ? Have you ever wanted to see a film that's different and not your normal film ? Well this is exactly the film for you . This is one of my favourites from the year , and even though not all the film is in the right order and not everything that should be seen in the film is shown there is just something about this film that just makes you go wow. And you know you want to see what happens next. I mean the film is just fun and I think it's something we all want in a film .|0
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.|1
This is probably my favourite TV show ever. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the PERFECT woman! Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is just something about it that is amazing, hard to describe.It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well. Here are a few examples. (The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end, but always play the opening credits. With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice, but some go on further.|1
This is without a doubt the most stunning and amazing documentary I have ever seen ! The images that are captured of the whale and its pod are unbelievable and very heartwarming. It is a must-see for everyone, for it touches the hearts of all. It was wonderful to watch and see the love between a young boy and his family, and a humpback whale named 'Keiko'. I loved seeing this whale and hearing its sounds, and I will forever remember this wonderful experience in my life. This documentary is a true life changer.|0
This Oscar-winning short film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). Well, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little brother, Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte.|1
As with so many modern US films , there has to be a supernatural element to the plot , but this time the story is set in New Orleans which is haunted by vampire hordes who live in the underworld , the hero is a vampire himself but does not feed off human blood and he is not the only one . So he and a vampire hunter team up to find and kill these rogue elements that are ruining the underworld as well as threatening innocent humans who are not aware of what is going on in their city , the hunter is looking for the rogue leader who was responsible for wiping out his family .|0
Hey look , you do n't watch this movie to change your life ! But if you are female especially and you do n't have a date yet or if you are single , you just can watch this movie to have fun for an hour and half , that's it !!! This film is not really good for the eyes !!! God , this is really bad ! The story is really really really really bad !!! The acting is ridiculous (especially when they are in front of a mirror !).|0
I 've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie . I agree with the movie reviews, it was a little dated, but I think it had a good story line. The filming in the 1930s seemed a little out of date too, but then again I like the fashion of that time period. The actors were all good. One of the things I liked best about the movie was how the main character of Conway played by Ronald Coleman was portrayed, like a real man with real problems, I like that .|0
"The Ali G show was really something amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper , but no one he interviewed would ever get the joke. It was the most brilliant comedy act I have ever seen - the guy is a genius - he will never be outdone - I hope he tours Australia soon - I will get seats! March 01, 2009, 12:00 AM ET
In Memoriam 2008:
The Deaths We Weren't Supposed To Have Yet
By MICHELLE GOLDBERG, THE PROVENCE
It was a year that didn't feel like 12 months, more like three years crammed into one."|0
I saw this movie on it's opening night, and enjoyed it. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been sitting by my father. My father saw the original (unfortunately, I have not seen it yet) and kept talking through the whole thing. He kept saying that the movie sucked, and that it was stupid. The thing is, he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film. In every horror movie, there is always a certain character depicted.|1
William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature . Faulkner mostly wrote about the history and the people of the Southern States . Faulkner lived in Mississippi , and many of the settings of his works were also in the Southern States . His books include The Sound and the Fury and As I Lay Dying . Faulkner 's books are usually about the poor , the lower class , or the weak . His stories are about how people are treated and what society does to people . The story of Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury follows four members of one family, the Compsons.|0
That 's right . Ohwon ( the painter and the main character ) is an exceptional person . What strikes me at first glance of Ohwon is his extraordinary character . Ohwon is very talented painter who is able to capture life through his paintings but he can't capture life in a painting and live his life . So he wants to be like a painter who can live the life in his painting . This man is a genius . And what i like about Ohwon is that the way he looks at everything and he is not afraid to look at every things in the world .|0
This Oscar-winning short film ( 40 minutes ) , based on a short story by William Faulkner , takes us into the South in the early 20th century. Jim Harris ( Richard Jordan ) is a poor black man who has a job loading cotton on the docks of New Orleans. Into the picture come his wife, Lucinda ( Cicely Tyson ) and their 9 year-old son, Benjy. After Lucinda leaves town to have an abortion performed, Jim makes the fateful decision to take his son with him for the day in an attempt to keep him out of trouble, and out of the way, in his absence.|0
"""Caribe"" is not a masterpiece in any of its storytelling aspects. However, it delivers a perfectly enjoyable story, along with a magnificent cinematography. The narrative structure is set around two narrative axes, one of them embedding the other, each one having elements that relate and co-exist in excellent harmony. The story never loses the right pacing, and it shows a very good blending of the human figure with its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is great, and for that we owe credit to the emerging director, Esteban Ramírez."|1
I wonder why I have n't heard of this movie before . It 's truly a magnificent comedy ( I 'm laughing out loud when watching it). I recommend it to every body who is looking for a very funny movie with a fantastic cast ( John Cleese , Martin Clunes , Jon Spiro ) and I hope that in the future , I 'll have the possibility to see it again. I'm still laughing now. I just saw this film, and I think it is one of my favorite comedies. I think the cast is wonderful, and the plot was interesting and funny.|0
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade . She smokes and drinks . She does n't have a lot of money . One night she goes to an underground party . There she meets this guy called Nick . They start to talk . Jenny Lewis: Are you new here? Jenny Lewis: Do you like this party ? Nick: I just want to get drunk and maybe have sex with a girl. Jenny Lewis: You can drink and dance if you like . Jenny Lewis and Nick chat and drink . They go outside the club and they kiss in the car park .|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five years in the making, one would be hard-pressed to expect any less. I did get the impression that some scenes from the first episode where repeated in the latter ones, which is naturally only a minor gripe.David Attenborough is great as a narrator and comments are informative, leaving enough room for one's imagination, and well spaced out, so that viewers get plenty of time to reflect upon the breathtaking imagery.|1
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD ( I 'm expecting to see the My Mother The Aircraft Carrier video on the market this week, just to prove my point) you often have to question what the value is of some titles. That is, of course, not so much the case with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) Home Video's new three disc, The History Of The World Tag Team Titles. In the 60's Vince McMahon, who was running wrestling in Capitol Wrestling (which would eventually become WWE) decided to try out a new idea.|0
The Aristocats is really quite charming, and is rated far too low on IMDb. The songs aren't as memorable as the ones in the Jungle Book, but they weren't bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best sequence being the landscape of Paris in general. It looked beautiful. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer quite rightly said, who doesn't love cats? Another great piece of animation was O' Malley looking into Duchess's eyes, as their romance was so believable while not obvious.|1
"""I am ... proud of 'Head',"" Mike Nesmith has said. He should be, because this film, which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels.Yes, it's unconventional. To many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt: ""You figure it out. ""You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception. TV shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first, than to entertain."|1
I believe that this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I have seen most of her movies.I saw this for the first time on television when I was around fourteen, and I was so scared.I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it very much.I know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much.That just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so.I love movies that do not show the graphic details, you let your imagination do the work for you.|1
Oh my gosh!! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so incredible......I loved it as a wee babe and still love it as an adult. It is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllllllll time! You should watch it, watch it and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton.....It is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to anyone who is a child or a child at heart.|1
If you expect that this movie is full of action and grabbing you from the start then don't watch it. But if you like those kind of meditative movies which stick in your mind for a while, until you get the details, then you will love it. Now don't get me wrong there is action and there are things going on just not in the usual way. Basically the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world where anyone fights in his (or their) way for survival. In this fight they lost the ability to speak...|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly ( 1936-1959 ) is a tour de force for Gary Busey, who portrays the musician and who won the Best Actor Golden Globe for his performance. Director Alan Rudolph has fashioned a moving story that is also a rock and roll anthology. We first meet Holly in Lubbock, Texas, where he lives with his mother ( Donna Mitchell ). The young Buddy ( William Joyce ) plays his music on the family radio; a guitar that he has purchased with money he has earned by working on a ranch.|0
When I saw this film at a festival years ago I was very impressed and I started to looking for it online. Now, finally it is released in theaters, and I am really glad I can finally get my hands on this one! What is it: After their young son is killed by a car, a grieving couple decide to adopt a baby. However, the child's biological mother dies before the adoption can be finalized and she appears to the child's father as a ghost, asking him to help her find the baby and bring him back, so that she can return into the afterlife.|0
"Better than it has any right to be, this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office. At times sophomoric, at others, bitingly satirical and witty, Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times, laden with drug and sexual humor, reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of ""Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex"" to the Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"", Saturday Night Live to Monty Python, Carlin to Cheech and Chong."|1
"Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage, so this wasn't a surprise to me. But there's one part that bugs me to no end, and I was hoping that someone could explain to me how it was done, because I really want to know:
When Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul are commenting on Daughtry's first live audition, they appear in the footage taken in front of the audience. When they start talking about what the audience was like, the footage is now superposed over their faces."|0
"I've never seen the original ""House Of Wax"" so I really didn't know what to expect when I went to a sneak preview of the new film. After a somewhat wobbly start introducing our young characters, ""House Of Wax"" shifts gears and becomes an extremely effective horror outing.The plot really doesn't matter too much here - I think most people know upon seeing this that these stranded kids are going to meet up with a nasty killer and find some awful things in the titular house of wax. It's all about the special effects here, and they are top notch."|1
"Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex... Magical realism is a very hard task, and I believe João Falcão has made it wonderfully. It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film, far from that. Although many people think the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book. Another mistake is to think that Falcão has been influenced by the series ""Hoje é Dia De Maria""."|1
This is a well directed Columbo episode, with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a Columbo movie. This also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle. It's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out. Perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough, since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light. At least when compared to different Columbo movies.For instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief, mostly coming from the Columbo character himself.|1
I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan , where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion . The movie has been playing all over Mexico, and it will be screened on April 21st at 5 PM, just before the start of the Easter holiday weekend, as part of the International Film Festival of Morelia. I'd recommend going to see it in a Mexican theater if you can. It's a Mexican independent film about a boy and his mother. The boy is a ten year old named Jorge who is blind, but has a remarkable memory.|0
"I never thought I 'd say this about a biopic , but there is a near over-abundance of characterization (which is good )and detail in ""Grace of Monaco"" , but too little action. And the movie runs out of things to say too early (though I still enjoyed it.) Much of the movie is about Grace Kelly as a person and her relationship with her royal family. We see her early in her marriage to Rainier. We also see the stress she was under because she had to choose between her new family and the one she grew up with."|0
"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads."|1
Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on the proliferating TV networks made it possible for people to produce more and more shows and actually improve their skills, or are they just clogging the airways with crap? You mean, instead of watching a few quality shows people now have to watch mediocre shows in order to find the quality ones? Isn't that what happens every time there is a new medium? Sure, the quality shows are still there. It's just harder to find them, but not because there aren't any, but because there are more.|0
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts. But it will put you close to being in a time and place that no longer exist by getting to the *feeling*.As Keith Richards remarks in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there's some Buddy Holly in almost all rock made since his day. The tragedy that took him is dealt with gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a great music career and a joyful body of music.Gary Busey does a remarkable, energetic portrayal of Holly, and his performances hint that he really gets into the music.|1
Indeed, Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond. Though I'm just wondering how she ended up as a 'rehab patient'(?) where Hurley is also in there trying to reduce his weight (as seen from the previous episodes).Anyway, this last episode is really suspended. The ending is not so understandable. I think the writer did expect the audience that there is a season 3 coming.I just hope the next season will give light to more unclear/hanging events that were happened.Just can't wait further for season 3.|1
I caught this show a few times when I was young and it was playing tilt , My parents loved it and so did I. I am happy to have got my hands on a few episodes on ebay that I have watched with my son. I watched every single show of this show for years as a young child. I even have the soundtrack to the show. The show and soundtrack will always be my all time favorite and I will treasure it as long as I live!! I think it is about time this show is brought back or made into a new series for the young people of today.|0
Pity the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (which they were) or being nothing more than a American knock-off of the Beatles (Again, which they were) but to the kids of the time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate. Discussions about who were better The Monkees or The Beatles were common on school yards but the critics, well they never quite bought into it. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop tunes, the Monkess did not receive much respect for their albums.|1
This film biography of early rock and roll star Buddy Holly (1936-1959) is a tour de force for Gary Busey. The movie's highlights are Busey's stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Holly songs. He brings such energy to the performances that Holly's own filmed performances almost pale in comparison. Busey's infectious toothy grin lights up the screen, he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deserved.The film follows Holly's career from growing up in Lubbock, Texas, to stardom and New York and his untimely death in a plane crash.|1
Try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you 'll see there's none! The music, cinematography, lighting and sound design make it a masterpiece of style. Everybody who thinks differently is just not hip enough and is just trying to fit into the norm. I love this movie and will never stop watching it! Because it has no plot or story, I couldn't get interested. I found myself wondering how much longer it was going to last! If you can't appreciate a work of art, you must not be a fan of art!|0
As an English teacher , I appreciate films that do more than tell a story . Good films , like good stories , can teach us about life, about our selves . In fact, this was the topic of a class that I taught , in which I assigned my students to view the movie “The Matrix.” I wanted them to see the ways that this film could be a “teacher” about life and about the world in which they live . And I am now convinced more than ever that this film is one of the best films ever made .|0
it's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight, and get into serious trouble. they find themselves fighting some shadowy people, and can't deal with. very, very disturbing portrayal of japan, the arbitrariness of modern life... some intense scenes, but a bit of a potboilerthe spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on English sub titles. obviously, i don't know Japanese.the only other Japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa, who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre.|1
Well, I guess I was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning. This movie wasn't it. It plodded along at a pretty slow, deliberate pace for the first 40 minutes, but there wasn't really anything in it that I was terribly interested in--there's an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character, whom I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to at the time.|1
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Sylia, Nene, Linna, and Priss are all back as the Knight Sabers in their hard-suits battling the robotic boomers. The animation is crisp, the characters are well-developed, and the action rocks. Priss is a singer in her regular job, so the series features some wonderful songs as well. There is a fair amount of violence, but most of it is against robots, and there is some fan service, but nothing too racy.|1
Valeria , an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and self-consciousness . She is so shy that she doesn’t believe anyone could ever love her and has never had a relationship in her life. Her boring life changes completely when she gets a job at the university. It’s an eventful job in which she’ll have to help a student to find out what happened to his former roommate. This is a job that will lead Valeria to a series of funny and exciting situations with her colleagues.|0
I saw this movie on PBS the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. It's a real testament to wanting to hold onto a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold onto the past, even the young characters, like Charlotte don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood is excellent. The cast is outstanding with all-stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy.|1
I never realized what a fabulous dancer Lana Turner was until I saw this movie. She was only 19 years old and gorgeous. What a pleasure to watch her dance with George Murphy. The story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special. I never tire of watching Fred and Ginger but Lana Turner in this movie was just as terrific. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who tended to over act. She should have done more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing.|1
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen, However, I am only in the second season.The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and irritating. His cigar ashes causing him trouble have been seen before, And the bit where he always identifies in some way with the murderer--in this case cooking ,Tho the scene on the TV cooking show distracted from the main theme.Also not explained was why the brother at the beginning of the show was cutting part of the wires of the mixer. The reason was never explained ,nor did it serve any purpose.|1
"Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I'm wondering why Cagney wasn't in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it's another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole ""swimming"" scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast."|1
I think this show was right on the money for me . I watched it over the plane but there were points were I could not take my eyes off the screen. The story line is very plausible but the way it is presented is also very plausible to what we see every day around us . I think it is very cool and I would love to see more of this kind of things . I hope there will be a second season . I have watched the first 2 episodes and I like it so far. It's kind of creepy, and that's what I'm all about.|0
This film , winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 ( tied with P.T . Anderson for Punch-Drunk-Love ) is not one of the more known of his films. Perhaps it is for the simplicity of its tale , or the fact that it does not have a major star . But Im Kwon-Taek is certainly the best Korean director alive , and this is one of his best film.The plot : A woman , Jang Hui-Mi ( Kang-Hie Jeon ) working in a bar as a hostess meets and marries Kim Jae-Hak ( Cho Jin-Woong ) a shy man in his 20s .|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it . That would be fine if there was a plot that made sense or at least some semblance of a story that could have been interesting, but it does neither of those. This was just a mashup of a few stories that make sense individually, but do not mash well at all when put together. There is no reason to see this, and I would not even recommend just watching a clip or two of it as there is nothing worth seeing.|0
It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. For dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for one) and funnier than many comedies I've seen in the past.The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care about it. Just to see Chucky and Tiffany bicker and fight each other.|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.This film doesn't take the easy way out.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is lightweight and the action sequences, though well-staged, aren't that exciting. But I laughed. A lot. Credit goes to the inspired pairing of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us up with a look or grimace. This movie will get a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.|1
Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is 'Ali G Indahouse' Although I prefer Ali G when he is interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen too.Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, that all make this film a riot for fans of Ali G.If you've seen him and didn't like him then avoid this film like the plague, because it's definitely just more of the same; for everybody else - watch it Aiiii!|1
"I don't care what some of the reviews said, this movie was funny. The thing with this film is that you can't expect anything else except to be entertained. This is not some intellectual comedy, this is a clever popcorn movie. The three main cast members are great and work very well with each other. Shatner is a standout in the supporting cast as himself, a former TV cop, brought in by Russo's character to coach the cops on how to be ""TV cops."" Those are by far the funniest scenes."|1
This is one of my favorite films, ever. The story is just so fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney films of the age, this film never bores the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good, but lack what we have here. This is funny, creative, and always on target. This movie just has an extra something that you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated film ever made. That title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story.|1
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville 's Century Theatre . A well crafted , solid drama with great performances from two of Britain's most talented actresses . The plot revolves around a mother daughter relationship set in the bleak and unforgiving world of London's East End . It has all the hallmarks of a Mike Leigh script . Great story , excellent dialogue . It has also been a winner of a BAFTA film award as well as a British Film institute award . An enjoyable evening , but not a film you would want see again and again . It was the only film at the box office .|0
I watch the show every day and it is very entertaining . It provides updates of tech news , video's of gadgets , news , reviews and tech trivia. I enjoy it very much . How do I make money on YouTube ? I have a lot of views on my videos and I wonder if I could get paid for it . I have heard that YouTube has ads that run during the video but I have not received anything . Is there anyway to cash in on the views ?? You can check out this website and you will be able to figure it out easily.|0
Barbora Bobulova's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time. It has been a long time since I have seen so much hidden passion and mystique presented by any actor simply by utilizing her facial features and the use of her eyes and mouth the way Barbora does with this character. She was entirely believable as Valeria and I was swept away with her characterisation of this role. All at once the film was real life and fantasy, the clever use of what was limited dialogue left me spellbound.|1
This is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it. My wife has never seen it, and when I just rewatched it last night, I waited until after she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple small snippets, but I know she would have had enough within ten minutes.Head has nothing like a conventional story. The film is firmly mired in the psychedelic era. It could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell, or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres.|1
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character . The humour is a bit silly at times . But he makes you laugh . It's been 21 years . Wow that's a blast from the past and how I felt back in the 90s. I would love a remake or a sequel and would love for some of the guys from 2012s The Watch to be the main actors. I'm going to have to give Ali G some more viewings. I was a teenager when it was on and I think I just missed it.|0
Buddy Holly was a pioneer and victim of the early days of rock 'n' roll. The young singer/songwriter from Lubbock, Texas left his mark on the template of modern music. Inspired by Elvis Presley, Holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock-a-billy sound recorded. Before his untimely death, he was mixing lush strings with be-bop rhythms. Holly would take his place with Presley, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Ricky Nelson as the voices of teenage angst.This easy to watch bio is not without flaws.|1
Being American , I have not been exposed to this character before , which is good because some of you readers may also not have. A few of the books are available through the Kindle Unlimited Program, which is how I have read the books in this series . As you know, I love all sorts of Science Fiction, but my personal favorite is Science Fantasy. This series fits into that category and is well worth the time to read the entire series. I don’t usually give ratings , but the first book in this series is getting a 5 STAR rating, which is pretty hard to give.|0
"Even after nearly 20 years apart, the original members of Black Sabbath have not lost a thing. In this concert, they perform their best songs from their heyday (1970-1978), including ""N.I.B. "", ""War Pigs"", and ""Paranoid"".Also included is priceless backstage footage with interviews and retrospectives into their days as the top hard rock band on the planet. The comments of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward are just as interesting and intriguing to watch as the fabulous onstage performances.A must-see for all Sabbath and Ozzy fans."|1
Dr. Paul Flanner ( Richard Gere ) , a successful surgeon , has his wife leave him , his son died in an accident , and his daughter is being bullied at school - all of which are leading him to contemplate suicide. In an attempt to cope with his problems , he moves to the countryside in a small town in New York state and tries to find happiness in his new life . There he meets a teenage girl , Celine ( Jena Malone ) who has just been abandoned by her single mother ( Laura Linney ) .|0
OK , so this film may not have won any Oscars , but it is not a bad film . It is well worth a watch on a Sunday afternoon , with a decent bottle of wine and some good crisps. A light hearted comedy /drama , which does not offend anyone , but which has enough going on to hold your attention. You can watch this film without having seen the original . If you have watched the original though you may understand why some of the characters in this one behave the way they do , because you have an insight into who they were in the past.|0
The A-team is still repeating every day on Dutch television ( RTL7 , around 1800hrs ) and I still watch it with pleasure. It is the most unrealistic program ever, but it is a good watch. The acting of the four main actors is always great and the stunt sequences are well done too. If I have to choose an 'A-Team' member I would probably choose Murdoch, as he always has the best ideas and makes the most use of them. I never liked Hannibal Smith very much and was always happy when he got a good whipping.|0
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie ( I have lived here my whole life) and the people of Hatteras have never been the same, it's as if they feel they are special and everyone should treat them like they are. The island has never been the same, it has lost a lot of it's history, it has lost many of it's small shops and local business. I can not believe people are actually proud to live there. I hate how people look down at the main landers as if we do not have lives and we do not have homes.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly(1936-59). He does have a spitting image to the man. Being a garage band in the 50's is sure different from today's. Having a group of three is usually simple back in those days. I bet that Buddy Holly(Busey) was a much better musician than most of what I heard. Since he lived in Lubbock, Texas, it was only a quiet country town back then. His parents were Christians, though his mother was a strong supporter of her son's work.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well. I liked this movie a lot. If you're going to rag on a Bridget Fonda movie, you can just rot. I thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea. Apparently somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I'm even thinking of buying it. I want it to be my very first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I rather would not start an online argument with someone I don't know & have it be over a movie.|1
In Tweety 's S.O.S , Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that Tweety has booked. He tries to kill Tweety, but is constantly foiled. Eventually, he is thrown overboard, where his life preserver is used by Sylvester himself to escape drowning in a stormy sea. Tweety wins the game. The game begins with Tweety getting on the boat with Sylvester hot on his heels. Each turn, Tweety gets on another part of the boat, and then Sylvester gets to take his turn.|0
"When ""Madame"" decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble. The snobbish Butler Edgar who is next in line to inherit decides to get rid of the cats. Thereby the story can begin and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise have been impossible. An adventure that lets them meet the charming, but not altogether trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them through many dangerous and funny situations until the inevitable happy end.The force of this movie is in its humor and music. Edgar is simply hilarious as the insulted butler who is out to settle the score and of course he himself takes some serious beatings."|1
Some days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian man with criminal precedents assaulted and tortured to death a middle-age lady coming back home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen everything, reported what happened.Therefore, it started a debate about the too much intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, everyone, indiscriminately.I'm only 15, but I thought: what idea of affluence does Italy give to these poor people? How ever do they regard us as the Land of Plenty? Yesterday evening I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question had an answer.|1
"Before I forget, let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated, critics would be lauding the ""direction"" in here, because it's really good.To the story: Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship, in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him, too, and you know his first comment - the same one he always makes when he spots the cat."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story, Two Soldiers is a top notch short film, a movie that has enough story, emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end. The story involves two dirt poor Mississippi brothers, one only a kid, the other old enough to volunteer for the war effort shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, played brilliantly by newcomer Jonathan Furr, doesn't want to let his older brother go, and he sets out on a quest to enlist in the Army himself.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've searched for a video but never found it until now, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't hold up. This glamourized version just can't rise up to the 1937 production level. I love Burt Bacharach's musical score, that is if listend to by itself, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it doesn't lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story. Just doesn't fit.|1
Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have a lot of friends and she has a nagging mother(Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself growing closer to her mom's boyfriend Billy(Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. This is probably my favorite TV movie. This movie shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This movie also has the best acting that I have seen in TV movies.|1
No real plot , no character development , no Scorcese-level direction , but seriously , were you really expecting any of that ? There were scenes that were a little baffling, but I'm just gonna have to accept that they just didn't make a lot of sense. I thought the ending was great because it was very true to life. It was a very well executed idea and the acting was superb. The characters were realistic, and this was one of the best horror movies I've seen in awhile. Not much of a movie but it's cool that it got made.|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 . I saw this wonderful movie in San Francisco last year and enjoyed it so much, that I was very anxious to see it again in its entirety. Today I received my review copy of Hari Om on DVD and I am absolutely delighted. The picture and audio quality is beautiful. I watched it with my daughter and it held her full attention for 1 hour 40 minutes. This is a beautiful movie about how a man's dream and devotion to his deceased wife can change the life of an entire town.|0
"Due to its predictable, second-rate title, (the one it was distributed under in Italy, at least) I didn't expect much from this movie. Thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house (""LA CASA MALEDETTA"" means ""The cursed house""). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres, reminded me a bit of The Exorcist and some of its decent Italian rip-offs, but this was going to be something completely different..."|1
"A very weird, psychedelic, esoteric, (and did I say weird? :) experience.But on at least on one level - it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It bridged the gap between the silly, manufactured, Hollywood look at teen pop idols that was the Monkees TV program and the adult, musically growing and evolving, and yet still a little silly Monkees of the '70s and beyond.The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith's, ""If they think we are plastic now, wait till they see how we do it."""|1
A great movie. The movie was even better then the commercials put on. And believe it or not it was very very inspirational. I really think anyone who walks out of the movie at the end will be inspired one way or another.It was kinda corny at the very beginning, but quickly picks up. I laughed. I laughed very hard on some parts. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better then average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (1st funniest being CLERKS II).|1
"Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever been in ! I love watching him ! ! i just wanted to thank you for this blog, its so interesting and i am learning so much! I agree with you there. He's very talented! I love reading about this stuff, and I have to admit to being more than a little excited by the fact that I've managed to dig up one of the ""lost episodes"" of Dark Shadows (I think it was the second one) from my Dad's basement."|0
I 'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it 's absolutely everything you could want in a film. It has a compelling, suspenseful story with a twist you won't see coming, superb acting, stunning cinematography (and I mean stunning! ) and a riveting score that has been stuck in my head since I watched it. Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins put in career performances here. I love the music score for the film so much I bought the soundtrack on Amazon. I watched this film and loved it!|0

A Formula For Murder isn't a well known Giallo, but that isn't to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as The Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late on in the Giallo cycle, but more than stands up to many of the films released around the 'golden' period in the early seventies. Despite a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly due to the competent way it mixes Argento style death scenes with some genuinely surprising plot twists, and a host of well defined characters.|1
"I think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax dummy just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car ""to get stripped"" deserves whatever happens to them.The guy, Wade who ""went to a barbershop and asked for the He-Man haircut"" wasn't my type, but there's this really cute scene of him having his eyebrows and facial hair waxed. That's a little too high-maintenance for me. Also fun, but not my type is the fat guy in the big sunglasses who looks ""like Elton John only gayer,"" but that whole plot goes nowhere!"|1
The Simpsons of course started off with Christmas special `` Simpson 's Roasting On An Open Fire '' which had all of the characters getting ready for Christmas. In the Simpson family we have the patriarch, Homer and the matriarch Marge, then there is Bart, his son, Lisa and her brother Maggie. They live in a town called Springfield, which is located in the State of Kansas, USA. Homer is the main character of the show, and has been called everything from fat, lazy and stupid, to a genius, and a loving dad and husband.|0
"NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salarymen who get in way over their heads when their innocent, drunken cheapshots p*** off three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, who are up to much more deviant no-goodness than even the film allows us to know, beat the living daylights out of one of our ""heroes"", the trio decides to return the favour in kind - only they accidentally KILL one of the other guys!"|1
"The ""old dark house"" sub-genre that dominated the early talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we re-view the oldies to-day. Here is one that provides so very many suspicious characters you have to wonder how they will be able to tie up all the loose ends in the 6 reel running time.The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who has sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that very night. Meanwhile the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs."|1
I ca n't get this flick off my brain . It 's definitely totally different than anything that 's out there. I hope it gets a distribution deal soon and it will get all the buzz it deserves! This movie is definitely going to be an instant classic! I can't get the music off my brain too! Amazing film! Loved the soundtrack too! Loved the movie, sound track, story, everything! I hope everyone that reads this goes out and watches the movie and supports it! A great piece of cinema!|0
That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there. And the message is sad. It says that, it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments, establishment and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you might not be able to bear it. It is about the battle of a single person with a system. With many systems.A great film of this wonderful Korean director.|1
"Warning -- this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids.The artist who this story is about should not be exposed to kids. Labels: Art, Graphic Violence, New York City
J.W. Ocker June 21, 2012 at 10:00 AM
I love that you included a disclaimer -- ""graphic"" is not even the word I'd use. I've seen a good share of violent movies and games, and I'm still shocked at this guy's imagination and talent. I would be interested to read the story of his life."|0
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO type channels. I missed the beginning but when I started watching Deadly Voyage the clicker was put down and not even thought of until the credits rolled. You will find yourself rooting against the villans and on the edge of your La-Z-Boy throughout this one. If you get the chance take the time to watch it. Every once in a while I think about having the cable company take off my Movie channels but when you stumble across great ones like this you know why it is worth paying extra for them.|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman : TAS and its ilk , I enjoyed it in a way that I haven't for an animated movie/cartoon in quite awhile. The voice acting was surprisingly solid, the script was funny, and I actually enjoyed the characters, even if at times I had trouble telling who was who (which isn't really the case with other movies like this, so maybe this is my own failing). This movie is basically an origin story, with all the usual beats, though with a few unique twists here and there.|0
The writers of lost have outdone themselves. Season two's finale is even more heartbreaking and intense than the finale for season one. Locke's lack of faith has not only resulted in spiritual consequences for himself, but in tragic physical consequences for the lives of the other castaways. Michael's betrayal resulted in a success for him but can he possibly escape the island? He will have to if he wants to stay alive. I don't doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge.|1
I first started watching The Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it just blew my mind every week with each episode, every episode had a twist and each week I couldn't wait for the next. How the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of 7 seasons is beyond me. This show manages to teach us about life, robotics, Alien and human encounters, and an insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects the people.|1
it's a great movie for the whole family. i don't think many people have seen it cause i ask people and they say that they've never heard of it before. Sophie Heyman is my aunt's sister in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie i can't even pick a favorite scene. my favorite character is Hubert because he is a funny yet smart dog. if someone hasn't seen it they are missing out on a great adventure. i've only seen it cause my aunt is related to Sophie and she got a copy from her.|1
"An old man is riding his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere , strikes him and he falls off. The car stops and the driver gets out to see how the biker is . ""Are you ok ? "" asks the driver . ""Well I think so . . . "" says the biker
""I am sure you are hurt and need help . Get into the car and I will take you to hospital."" says the driver. ""Oh I am ok. I am so sorry to trouble you."" says the biker ."|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old . I had no idea who Buddy Holly was until I saw this movie . I was immediately obsessed . I remember thinking that the music was great and it made me sad that he died so young. I think the reason why I love this film is because of the music . I am a huge Buddy Holly fan . There are many great films out there about musicians but I love this one in particular because of the way it captures Buddy’s story , it’s a great tribute to Buddy Holly .|0
I thought it was brilliant! It was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed in looks, neither had Dirk Benedict, he still looked just as dishy! I thought that Mr T looked thinner though, but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time. I thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr T could'nt make the actual reunion.|1
by TyNesha Mells. In this drama, Ja Rule, who stars as Reggie, struggles with the loss of his father. His old friend J-Bone, who is a cold-blooded thug recently released from prison, helps Reggie find who murdered his father. A week after his dad died, a preacher, Reverend Packer, came up dead. Reggie was suppose to be the one to kill him, but did he? Did Reggie kill Reverend Packer or was it some type of a setup? Back in the Day also has a couple of romantic scenes.|1
"He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song, and now the terrific Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite TV shows as a kid, The A-Team. The only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great George Peppard who played main character Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help. He did manage to reunite all members including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck #2) who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt."|1

I absolutely adore this movie ! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw the cover and thought I'll give it a shot, it looked interesting. When I got home, I didn't even know the movie was a musical, but I pressed play and was just blown away ! I ended up buying the DVD right then and there ! I love everything about this movie. Even though there is a sad part to it, I think the ending is perfect and I think it is a very happy ending.|0
Oh I remember watching this show at 4:00 p.m. during my junior high days. It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework.Still, the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems.But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers; it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall.The lead actress (can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details) delivered a fantastic performance.|1
This film was made right in the area where I grew up and now live. I know personally most of the property owners of the various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the fields surrounding the isolated road shown late in the film with Ron Perlman, Jonathon Furr, and the car. I am told that Jonathon Furr and Ben Allison are are natives of NC. I was fortunate to see it at a local showing. At that showing was one of the people who helped select locations and secure props, such as the bus (1938 Greyhound) used in the movie.|1
When the new Outer Limits first started, the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging. As the series began to wind down, most of the episodes became just plain ugly and devoid of any entertainment value. The six episodes here reflect the very best, and worst, of the series.Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer my own. Starting with the most entertaining to the flops.1. Afterlife: As an institution, The U.S.A. military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention plain stupid.|1
Oh my gosh ! ! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This movie is awesome! i would definitely watch it again and again. I think the actors did such a great job! This movie was so realistic I cried a little bit. It has a little bit of romance but not to much to make you not want to watch the rest of the movie. 5/5 for this amazing movie!!! I would recommend this to all my friends and my sisters and I will watch it with my sisters.|0
`` Hari om '' is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name. `` Hari om '' is a young man with a bright future: he has a job with a large bank, has just received his promotion and has been promised a lucrative position within the company. One evening while at work, he meets an attractive girl who works in the next building. She is the girl of his dreams, but soon he begins to notice some strange phenomena around his desk, and his life is suddenly thrown out of balance.|0
Thanks to the helpfulness of a fellow IMDb member I've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years, and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick. I can't believe that Channel 4 have let this one vanish without a trace as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. It focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' from school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other.|1
The movie is excellent . Acting , cinematography , direction and music are spellbinding . It seems to me that this movie has got 5 star reviews only. I feel it is a bit of over rating . Review : I saw this film yesterday. This is a great movie. Great performance of the actors, superb dialogues, excellent cinematography, beautiful songs, music and background score. If you like movies such as Anniyan/Thalli pogattu etc.., then this will be very good for you. It has the similar kind of emotions that you can see there.|0
I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary . I knew it was about a woman that went missing in 1996 and I was hoping to learn more about her. I did learn more about Maura, however, what I learned was far more than I ever expected to learn. This documentary was not a waste of 2 hours by any means. I believe it was very informative and interesting. I do wish that there was a little more to it. I believe that this documentary could have gone deeper into the people in the case.|0
"The best thing from the American Pie ""bakery."" I found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the American Pie movies to date. .Also concerning the appropriateness of the content I found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie first came out I read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater...I now regret that decision."|1
This film is an impressionistic , poetic take on the immigrant experience , a reflective look at the turmoil and transformation that occurs to immigrants when they arrive to a foreign land.The film examines the relationship between immigrants and America. The film looks at immigration from a personal and poetic perspective, by exploring the inner journey of one immigrant's quest to define his identity. The film explores how immigrants struggle to make a sense of their relationship to a country that is in a state of constant change. Immigrants are forced to recreate themselves, re-define themselves in this new culture.|0
"""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is one of the coolest Italian horror films I've ever seen, and I've seen my share. To call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie.Complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old, Fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school Italian feel. The setting is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect."|1
This was a riveting film, one that really drew me in. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts in a wonderful performance. His great likeability, coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him (and by extension myself, as his confidante and silent witness). It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended, I was so wrapped up in it.|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times . I taped it in about 1987 when it was broadcast on a Sunday night on Channel 5 . The tape was only 3 inches wide so I had to wait for the end credits each time I had it on and rewound it to watch the rest of the tape . When the tape went I went in search of another VHS tape but it never came . Then one day I discovered on Amazon that this had been released on DVD and ordered a copy for a small fortune .|0
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious. Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skull master, the bad guy, would always be vowing to kill Max with some insane cackling. The writing is the best. I was glued to the set when this would come on when I was younger. If they came out with a DVD of all the episodes they made I would be forced to buy it. This and a Conan the Barbarian cartoon are the ones I miss the most from childhood. I think these cartoons are the most unappreciated out of all the great cartoons.|1
Being a middle aged mom myself , I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in and out of reality and fantasy in a very realistic way. The romance itself is a big part of the story, and I was glad that there's more emphasis on the story and the characters' growth than just the sexual tension. And it's great how you can read between the lines and guess how things will unfold between them without being too graphic about the intimate scenes - it's all about the mood and what's in the air!|0
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London(England). Enjoyed it immensely. Although the Crow & the Chinese Policeman don't appear, and Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (Writer/Director) voiced/played by Lord Richard Attenborough, works very well.The rumour is that Lord Attenborough and Elliott Gould (as Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for just a pint of beer.Spike was shown the film, on video before he died and by all accounts enjoyed it immensely.|1
1969 was the year. New York City was the place. Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film to achieve some recognition. The first was Chaffed Elbows (1966). Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and Greasers Palace (1972) were even more profane and obnoxious. Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Prince's feature film career for several years.The subject at hand is Putney Swoope. And it is a mad farce/satire that has to be seen to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here.|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it. It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good. A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love. Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.|1
"This new installment to the Child's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as a stoner witnessing Chucky giveing him the finger and saying ""rude f--king doll"" and lots of references to the series: ""you can kill me but I'll come back. I always come back"". The movie's title was probably thought of before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all other films in the series. It doesn't even have Andy, the central character for all the previous ones."|1
This is one of Chaplin 's First National films from the period between his glorious Mutual shorts and the more mature features of the early 'Twenties. It's a trifle in comparison with the later work and it's not even the greatest of the First National short comedies - that's The Pilgrim or The Pawnshop. But there's a lot going for it. In the first place the idea that you've seen a film before is not always to be dismissed. There is, of course, an argument that everything that's been made is just a variation on something that's already been made.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert . A brutal but beautiful album , it's one of the best black metal releases of 2014 in my opinion . Lyrics wise the album talks about the desolation , depression and fears of this world . Lyrically, I don't know about the rest but I'm pretty sure it was a collaboration between the guy that did the cover for this release (who also designed the logos and the layout of the physical edition of this) and the vocalist.|0
This movie is a love story set in the backdrop of war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD asap and watch it many times over. The story ends as it started I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her for becoming a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend-husband, and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also an phenomenal actor. Some stories do have happy endings.|1
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.'|1
No, I have not seen the original series and I won't compare the two if I had. This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species.|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It's one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It's a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen.|1
But a great cast! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning.I'm not totally sure that any description of the movie and plot are going to entice you to watch this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for practically everyone: death, singing, a sparkly suit, cell phones, a little person (nice looking woman, actually), a drawbridge (modern, not Medieval), a boombox, and a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic.|1
I taped The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie network and I watched The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I am glad that Walker got his brother Luke to confess of murdering his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching True stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie network and on Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I am going to watch The Morrrison Murders again because My favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders.|1
SHOWTIME is a mess , but it 's an entertaining mess . The plot is forgettable , the satire is mild at best . The cast is great , but I think they could've done more if the script was good . SHOWGIRLS is better , it 's sleazy & it goes further . I've only watched this movie once, but I remember liking it enough to watch it many times after, and it never got old! I loved this film back then, I love it just as much today, and I don't care what anyone else thinks of it.|0
I've been a fan of Rachael's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network, so I have seen her grow over the years. The minute I saw her interact with Oprah, I predicted that this show would happen, because I saw how taken Oprah is with her, and with good reason: she comes across as very natural, and willing to laugh at herself, which is very engaging. The set is appealing, and there are some fresh ideas (I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on).|1
"I gave it a seven only because the acting is good. And of course by that I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were ""decent"". But the characters themselves...what on earth was so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him behaving like the martinet Emily Watson accused him of being. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insufferable jerk who I was praying would meet an extremely brutal and prolonged demise. Who was I kidding? Tom Wilkinson isn't Paul Bettany after all."|1
"*May Contain Spoilers*The first time I saw this movie was when it was re-released on video when I was around 8 years old. Now I am 17 and still watch it whenever I get a chance to. ""The Aristocats"" was a cute heart warming film that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano. In fact I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since I loved it that much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats I ever saw."|1
Wow , What a wonderful film-making ! Mr. Im has done it , again ! His last work , ChunHayang , was fantastic as well. This time , his heroine is Park Eunhye , a very pretty , cute actress. The cast is great ! The story , though simple , was very very good . I could really feel their passion for making a movie . I hope , more and more movie makers make such movies , with simple but touching story line , instead of those stupid horror movies that have been made so much recently. There is some gorgeous shots in this movie .|0
My favorite show of all time ! Yeah , I thought this was so cool , and Larisa Oleynik was really beautiful and very sexy ! She made me watch the show because she was so hot , she is still hot . This show is awesome , I could watch it every day ! I wish they'd come up with something like it again , so I could watch it as often as I'd like !!!!!! Oh man, I used to love this show. The cast was awesome and the show really had heart.|0
When I first saw this movie , I also expected `` our boys '' to be cute , and more of a drama then a horror , but I don't think that I have ever been so wrong about a movie in all my life , it was great , and very creepy and scary , it was just amazingly written and acted out . It was an awesome movie , and if you like horror I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I did . If you haven't seen it , you need to .|0
"This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella, or Bambi, but it IS a very sweet, enjoyable, romantic, well-done Disney animated feature.There are, of course, lessons included herein for the kiddies, and some very appropriate kiddie-cheek, but there is plenty herein for the adults, as well.While this is somewhat of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which solely belong to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the ""tramp"" and Dutchess is the ""lady,"" but Dutchess has several kittens and they are all trying to get home.Phil Harris is our tomcat O'Malley."|1
Hey all you jive hustlers, you stone foxes, you mean dudes. Watch out cause Slaughter is back in town! If you are looking for a bad-ass, funky film to watch some night, this is just right. 'Slaughter' is back and trying to take it easy n' relax after his adventures down in Mexico. But if you are a narrow-minded gangster like 'Duncan', you are bound to seek revenge. Why, I don't know. Was 'Hoffo' in the first one his brother or what? Any who.|1
A very suspenseful giallo from the director of `` L'Anticristo '' ( 1974 ) , this one begins with a woman ( Nieves Navarro ) being killed by an unseen assailant. The police investigate but the case soon goes cold until the beautiful widow, Sonia ( Barbara Bouchet ) shows up. When Sonia is also killed the police realize that there is a pattern to the deaths, and one that's only just begun. It's inevitable that when we look at an Italian horror film of any type we're going to expect to see nudity and plenty of blood.|0
I know this movie is n't for everyone , and I wo n't push my opinions on you , but you should really try this movie, and see if it's something you 'd like. It's a simple movie, about the realities of a teenage girl in today's society. I really liked this movie. It was really sad, and yet it made me happy. It was also really funny, but I think the best part of this movie is how real it is. Brie Larson is a really great actress.|0
this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall its an entertaining movie and will give u some laughs, this isnt a bad teen movie, even tho it has a stupid premise a teenage boy that wants to lose his virginity, this movie was funny and it has a nice message to, i like the acting and directing and writing, and i enjoyed the movie. A high school student tries to make it through the rest of school without losing his virginity.|0
"This version of ""The Lost Horizon"" is actually not a bad film at all. I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals, especially those made in the 70s. I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 (I was ten) and really enjoyed it, the music especially. (Burt Bacharach has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, the acting is good, and technically it's excellent. Sure, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win 'em all."|1
"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and , by the process , their own lives. Award Winning - 2007 New York Festivals - Silver World Medal - Documentary Feature
Motherland is an award winning feature length film about a son who returns home after 20 years and attempts to reconcile with the mother who has been the dominant figure in his life. The film begins in 1981 in New York City, and then returns to 1961 in rural Alabama. The film has an epic narrative scope and explores universal themes about family, love, betrayal, and the struggle for identity."|0
In this early Fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre. Personally I think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore. It's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its subtextually rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small-town mentality and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the twisted ideals of the Catholic church, the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on.|1
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious, but I must have had a grin on my face the entire time. I like this darker kind of comedy; ""very bad things"", ""8 heads in a duffel bag"" or ""coldblooded""The way the main character tries to get away with murder is a lot of fun to watch. To me it was not much of a surprise what the ending would be, but the way that ending came about was. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they have managed to involve the audience."|1
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO , regardless of the age of the OAV . The plot also feels kinda shallow . The only positive I found in this show was the character designs and art work . It was very much reminiscent of many other animes from that era . The animation is dated, but it’s not the worse. The art has a great feel and the action is pretty good even if the backgrounds are static. The story is simple, but is not that bad either. The character design is great and many of them are memorable.|0
"Chucky is back but this time he is not scary ( a lot ) - but he is funny !!! Well, I'm pretty sure you have heard or read about the new movie from the Chucky franchise and it's name is ""Curse Of Chucky"". We can say this is a good movie !!! Why ? well, because it is a funny horror movie. A horror movie where you laugh ( well , at least some scenes ). So, what the movie is about ? Ok, Chucky is a doll, he's alive and he's a serial killer."|0
This movie , based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt , is one of the best films I 've seen in years and one of the best South African films. If you can find it , I think you should watch it ! I watched it this morning and enjoyed every minute. It's not often you get a film which is such a good watch, with good acting and a story which is told very well. The film is set in a time ( 1967) when the country was going through major changes in all areas of our lives, including the educational system.|0
When the trailer for Accepted first came up, many people began to get excited about seeing it... really excited. Who could blame them, it looked like fun. But that's exactly the thing. People went into Accepted looking for a good movie, but if you think about it, Accepted isn't the type of film destined to be a good movie. It's meant to be a film that pleases its crowd without too much effort being given. That being said, for those of you who expected a great film, you need to think about what could be made of a comedy like this one.|1
At first I didn't think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you.|1
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian film experts. There were moments of silence in the audience as they absorbed this film as a whole. I would say this film is definitely for people who really want to see the other side of India. It's not all about snake charmers and beggars. India is one the fastest growing country economically in the world and it is interesting how this growth has affected people at all levels from the poorest to the richest and everyone in between.|0
Let 's be fair : there are no RULES for scriptwriting , so I wo n't say the movie SHOULD have gone this way, nor that way, or whatsoever way. There is only this movie and I will only discuss it as I have seen it , with all the expectations and disapointment it brings to us. In a nutshell , the whole movie feels like a collection of different moments of the series, stitched together with little coherence or logic, as if it was made by different people from different countries and cultures and then assembled.|0
* Could contain spoilers , read only after seeing last episode season 2 * Think about it . The guys in the bar told us everything, and it’s all there in front of us , but no one will ever see it. How can you see something when you are blind ? How can you understand something if you are deaf ? Why would someone want to kill you when they love you? How can we understand a thing when we’re so dumb? Why would someone try to stop us if they want us to succeed?|0
To say the truth, I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. Folks may not agree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus before, so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress. So, here's what I think:The movie is good (I haven't read the novel, however). Some moments were really thrilling and... unexpected. Altogether you'll find the plot pretty simple.|1

This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time . Top 20 movies for the past 10 years for me . Very well done. Very emotional and it's great to see such an important piece of history done this way. It is so well written. It is so well done and well made, I don't think it is possible that it can be improved on. It is a very important message for all. It is a very emotional story and the acting is very well done. This movie had everything.|0
Lucio Fulci, later known for his graphic horror films like The Beyond and Zombie, was years earlier a master of the Italian giallo (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Don't Torture A Duckling. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery/thriller genre known as the giallo, but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in his/her own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town?|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius, chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which an artist is capted...the decision whether to ease the demands of the popularity or to create something new and to define ones' own style.Chiahweson's desperate seek for inspiration and broadening his conscious led him to live the way he did, restless, outrageous, and yes very drunk! But still he defended and retained the most important ethical rules for an artist: respect to his Master, respect to the nature and the gradual seek for improvement and to perfection.|1
"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted."|1
I never heard of architect, Louis Kahn, until this documentary. In this almost two hour documentary which goes very quickly, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter Sue Ann.|1
I'm not sure why this film is averaging so low on IMDb when it's absolutely everything you could ever want in a horror film. This is the definition of being a horror film. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must say that this house delivers the goods. House of wax Is the story of a group of college kids on their way to a football game whom decide to camp out for the night and have a run in with a local weirdo. Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part.|1
What 's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season ... Here I am !!! As you can imagine, this is not my first thread, I have seen and read many of them on here and I like them all. This is my first time here so you can ask me questions about me and I'll try to answer ... I'm curious !!!! I was 7 years old when it started and I still don't stop watching !!! I don't want to !!!|0
This movie got better with time. I can't believe that it has been forty years since I saw this at the age of 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk into any movie. Imagine what it was like for a kid my age to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the times. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King has just been killed but the following summer had a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to stick it to the man.|1
The very few reviews I could find online of Barnens ö really do not do it justice. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I regretted it almost immediately, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very glad now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie.I won't give a synopsis of the plot, because other reviewers have already done that. But I will say that I don't understand comments that it's bleak, shocking, weird, clinical, depressing or pornographic.|1
I just thought I would add another observation , here . While there are a couple of visual sub-references , there is a real similarity to the original 'Dark City'. The two are in the same ' genre ' and this is where I get my point. I believe that there was a serious effort to ' pay homage ' to the other , as I have noticed several subtle and not so subtle nods in this film . Aside from these , however there is much to admire here and it is a real joy to watch it . The cast is well chosen , the acting believable .|0
"In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I've heard it was ""The Greeks Don't Get No Freeks"". Is that right? I really liked that sound. I also liked the ""Hyde's Got Nothing to Hide"" in the final scenes. Truly a doper movie, but with many laughs and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was reminiscent of some places I have visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing. She looks much different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit."|1
This film , like much of their music , is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer . It is an interesting take on a time period which has been done to death on the big screen . If the film has any failings it is in the soundtrack . I'll second your comment that this film seems underrated or at least little noticed by casual fans. It's a fun film, and a lot of people who don't like the music still like the movie, though they tend to have little to no interest in the music, which would be a shame.|0
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once, about ten years ago. I remember I liked the book a lot, and this movie does a good job in telling the story. The most important thing in this movie isn't the story, however, but the highly original visual look it has.The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and they are apparently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings combined with live actors, stop-motion animation and sets that are painted so that they look much like from an animated movie.|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something , and who appreciate a farce that is clever and witty, this is the perfect movie to watch. This movie is the one that has won the hearts and minds of not only the audience, but of the jury members at the festival as well. Not everyone would agree on that though. The critics of the movie have said that even though they found the movie to be a bit over the top at some points, they really enjoyed watching it and so did the people around them.|0
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of the new India, through the eyes of a foreigner. Bharatbala, the renowned director, has once again shown his skill and expertise through his film, New India. Shot in India at various locations including Jaipur and Udaipur, this film is a visual and sensory treat to all. New India takes the audience through the journey of India and how she has been transformed since her independence, and how she is continuing to develop and grow.|0
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture. How can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of Paris? Only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat O'Malley, a rough diamond with romance in his heart. After they get a taste of the wide dangerous world, he guides them home, and Edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse.|1
No . I 'm not kidding with this one . He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave a rave review of GLEE . And he gave it 2 stars . Now that's just one guy . A guy that I don't know anything about , a total stranger , and his opinion shouldn't really matter to me . And yet . . . well , he's the critic for the New York Times , a very well-known , respected publication . And if the NY Times likes it , I should like it , too . Right ? And not just that one critic , either .|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families by stowing away on an outbound ship. They think that if they successfully make the voyage they can better their lives by making enough money in New York to send for their families. Unfortunately for them, the ship that they select is a rundown Russian freighter which has already been heavily fined at a previous port for harboring stowaways. The captain and the first mate are determined not to let this happen again as their jobs are on the line.|1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution, although the war was nearly over by the time of its release. The tramp goes to war, humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Kaiser in the bum. It's a very funny film, although I don't think it nearly one of his best. It's with 'A Dog's Life' as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece 'The Kid.'|1
For those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings , who love film , have a love and passion of the craft of making movies and understand how difficult this task really is and respect the people who are involved in this craft. For us cinephiles there are two film festivals that we all wait for with great interest and excitement. The first of which was the Palm Springs Film Festival. It was held from January 2nd to the 13th. I was there for 4 days and had the most wonderful time. The weather was perfect and all my friends in the industry were there.|0
"I'm not a huge fan of Lucio Fulci's films. Most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second-rate Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining ""Zombi"" (which was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy them. I know Italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. This is why ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" surprised me. Its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery."|1
We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and off beat-- Not your usual Hollywood drivel.My husband had a Blockbuster coupon and passed on a string of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to walk out when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy -- and with some glitches in the DVD that we finally had to flip to wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to make it stop stalling. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role.|1
"Lucio Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by series of brutal murders of young boys.This surprisingly well-directed film(especially in comparison to later Fulci's gorefests)is distinguished by overall atmosphere of perversity,nastiness and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence.The soon-to-be-dead children are depicted as casually cruel and budding peeping toms;Bruno's near-seduction by the naked Patrizia(Barbara Bouchet)really has to be seen to be believed.Highly recommended-especially in pair with my another cult favourite ""House with the Windows That Laugh""(1976)."|1
Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? I doubt it!Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays. Thomerson has been funny in anything he does, from movies to series to stand-up comedy. If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it. I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape. One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll & Hyde theme ever.Of course.|1
Captain Corelli 's Mandolin is no Oscar contender but it was pretty good . I have to admit Ms Cruz was very pretty but then so is the sunrise when I look out the window every morning . I think she is stunningly beautiful, and if I were single she would have me at 'hello'! You are so right. I have never seen anyone who looks more beautiful than her. In the film she is a perfect beauty. I've never seen anyone who looks more like a 12 year old boy than her, but hey...to each his own.|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously , its primarily directed at young teens and pre teens and therefore I believe that they would understand this movie more then you. It was not made to have any deep meaning, I believe. To me, this movie was just meant to entertain and show the young audience what they are looking for. They can't see a good romantic movie until their about 16 anyway, because most movies with romance and so forth, are too deep and are meant for an older audience.|0
"Cult-director Lucio Fulci is probably most famous for his gory Zombie flicks from the 1980s that earned him his rightful reputation as the ""Godfather Of Gore"". Fulci's absolute greatest film, however, dates back to 1972 and, while it is definitely gritty and violent, it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" aka. ""Don't Torture A Duckling"" of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film, this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre."|1
A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that 's very reminiscent of `` The English Patient ,'' which won the Best Picture Oscar last year. Based on the work of Peter Mattiessen (who also co-wrote the screenplay with Christopher Plummer), this tale of an adventurer (Plummer) who becomes involved in the bloody political upheaval in 1947 in the then-Indian state of Ceylon, also includes a subplot featuring a beautiful young woman (Jennifer Ehle) and a man she falls in love with. This side story was probably added to pique the interest of American audiences accustomed to love triangles.|0
"Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: ""Captain Correli´s Mandolin"", just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly, inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting, with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in ""Blow"" -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay, it was painful. But there were saving graces.The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic, and Cage does have some (-- redeeming, this is !--) musical ability."|1
My impression , having seen this documentary , is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had when he began the film. I felt like Kahn was just sort of basking in the light of his famous father and his father’s work. I think Kahn did an amazing job on this film , I think the best of his three documentaries . The film opens with an introduction by his famous father , the architect, Louis Kahn. I found this introduction very touching. We hear about the love of the architect for his son. He seems so warm and caring .|0
You know, people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and a dwarf in a movie with Cathy Bates as the romantic lead...and it works. Not only does it work, it works very very well. In fact, I think it's perfect. I laughed so hard I think I hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human, so honest, and so very real. But isn't that where great comedies come from?|1
"I absolutely adore this movie! I had never heard of it when I saw it at the video store. I saw Kathy Bates was in it, so I figured it had to have some worth, you know? I watched it the first time just shaking my head . . . huh? Then it was the last scene and I found myself aching from smiling so hard. I clicked ""play movie"" and watched the whole thing again. It is without doubt the quirkiest movie I've ever seen. But the more I watch it, the more I love it."|1
This is a brilliant film. The story starts off in Romania,where Billy Crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything. There is a really funny scene here, where Crystal is a child, and talks his father, who is a rabbi into eating pork (you filmophiles may know that this is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew, he accidently falls into a small river.|1
Separate LIES changed my life . Actually , the Q & A did.SPOILERS BELOW . Read only if you watch the film . The thing that I’ll remember from the experience of watching this film , besides it’s sheer brilliance is that my husband is watching it in the room next door. I was so scared that this was going to be a bad movie , that I wasn’t going to see it , I didn’t read a thing about it . I was just so scared it would be a bad version of GOODBYE CHRISTOPHER ROBIN ( which was actually good ) , that I stayed away.|0
The Monkees , surprisingly , are a big favorite of mine . Yes , they might have been the original Boy Band . They got their start after auditioning for the television series , HEAD in 1965 . What happened was , the producers liked them but they were told they could only use the four for a few minutes each per episode . The producers decided to make a pilot of their own . It was a huge success , and the rest is history . Of the four members , Davy Jones will be the most recognized , as he became an international superstar with the television series , THE MONKEES .|0
Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job. He apparently received no credits. Too bad.All the Dead End Kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry. It is odd to watch them in a Western setting with their Brooklyn accents ( I guess that should be Bowery ). They even show some swimming abilities.I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing/love/crime story. My favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film.|1
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Short scenes, to the point, cheap to shoot, guerilla-film-making, no sets (just disused buildings) and possibly an empty hospital wing. Also, even the black&white film-stock was a stroke of genius, probably selected more for its low expense rather than film effect, but it worked.Reno was amazing as the Brute. Everyone's acting was brilliant. The plot was simple and effective and no flabby bits left to distract you.|1
My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film. He took five years to make it, a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to leave in, what to take out. His father, the renowned architect Louis Kahn,comes across as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity.|1
The young John Garfield turned in a fine performance in the 1939 `` They Made Me a Criminal . '' Garfield, who had appeared in only a few films, plays a gangster's kid who tries to go straight but gets framed for murder. The story, based on a magazine article by Dwight Taylor, was written for the screen by John Wexley, and the film was directed by Busby Berkeley, the veteran choreographer and director. Garfield went on to become a star and is best known for `` The Postman Always Rings Twice '' (1946).|0
I do n't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch. When i saw this was from the writer of Dirty Grandpa, i thought, how bad can this be? Not great, but, i laughed. It is a very strange story. I won't tell you any of the twists but if you have an hour and a half to kill, give this a go. You will have to pay attention, or you will miss things. The ending is predictable, but i liked the journey getting there.|0
It was a terrific movie! I like to watch it again and again. The actors were awesome. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime would put this movie on DVD. I would most definitely purchase a copy. This movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was great. All I know is, I will watch this movie every time Lifetime airs it.|1
I really enjoyed this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think it was important that they showed the other couple's life as well as Terry and Bobbys and show them as people with emotions. As this film needed to show Bobby as a cold and vindictive person.I agree with another review it was sick love, not true love. He didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby. He should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together.|1
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it . It is just not available anywhere! Please tell me what you know and where i can find the movie. I am so sorry! The film was taken down from Amazon years ago. It’s not on any streaming services that I can find. Maybe it will pop back up one day, but I won’t hold my breath! It is definitely a shame because I think the movie deserves the recognition it could get. Hi there. I also watched the movie last night and have been searching for it.|0
Exclusively for Coop 's lovers , though Clint Eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this film, in fact is the glue between the main characters of the film which is not a war film but rather a drama . In the early seventies there was a big debate on whether women could or not be combat pilots, and it is precisely these pilots who are portrayed in the film. The story revolves around the 3 women who were the first pilots in the American Navy and the story is told by a journalist who follows the girls.|0
The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. The humour is very much a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically incorrect, irreverent and self effacing type.Personally I totally love this film, and so has everyone i have met who has seen it. You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English, and specifically London, so its possible that non-English viewers may not get some of the humour.|1
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie . But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch , I don't really have a favorite this time around. Diora is a great actress and so is everyone else in this film. This is a truly great movie , I would recommend it to anyone , I have seen it a million times and can't get enough . I have no problem recommending it to any of my friends. I thought this film is very entertaining and fun to watch. The cast is great. The story was good, but the ending was a bit disappointing.|0
Mark Blankfield ( from the old late night TV show `` Fridays '' ) plays Dr. Daniel Jekyll , a mad scientist that is obsessed with the human epidermis , and who is also on probation for murdering his wife by stomping and stabbing her and throwing her in a pit with snakes . One night Jekyll discovers his neighbor's daughter , Cathleen , who he wants for himself . When she rejects him , he drugs and hypnotizes Cathleen with the help of a fellow mad scientist , who turns out to be the neighbor's son !|0
This movie got better with time . I ca n't believe that it has been forty years since I saw it in theaters as a small child. It was a big deal then, and I've enjoyed watching it grow in it's status. There are so many great things about it, that the only criticism is that the music doesn't work in certain scenes. As a whole, the score and the songs are excellent. But there are some songs that are stuck on the sound track as place holders for something better. I'm a big fan of John Williams' work.|0
"I have to admit I had never heard of this movie . I caught it last night on TMC . I enjoyed this movie immensely . A great plot , great actors , great writing . The plot involves a man who loses his job and gets involved with a small time crook who uses him as a pawn in his plot to get money and power . It was a great movie . Great movie! I love it when the ""hero"" is the ""bad guy"" - in this one, I really didn't have any sympathy for them."|0
I did n't know what to expect when I rented this widescreen DVD . I knew it had a cult following and had been remade in Hollywood in 1971. I have also recently enjoyed reading a book that was inspired by the film (I think it was The Devil Rides Out). I am happy to report that it is a good movie. The plot is very straightforward, the characters are clear, the storyline moves along briskly. The film also looks very good, it has an authentic Victorian feel to it, and the lighting and sets are beautiful.|0
When his elderly mother Emily ( Jeanne Bates ) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier ( Brion James ) in her home in 1935 London, an enraged and distraught Harry Fawkes ( Michael Keaton ) confronts his former friend, only to be shot and paralysed by Duvalier with an old hunting gun. Eight years later a now wheelchair-bound Harry ( Danny Glover ) returns home to care for his now widowed mother, where he is reunited with her housekeeper Florence ( Tonga Leal ). But it seems that Duvalier was not as dead as Emily had assumed, and that he is now stalking his old victim from the shadows...|0
Sit back and let Director Bharatbala lead us into a visual and sensual voyage of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say you really enjoyed a movie? This movie has pace and keeps us moving in directions that may only exist in India. If you didn't want to visit India before this movie will surely make you want to visit it now. This movie has dancing girls, a chase scene, and the mafioso involved. But it has a lot more. Thanks, Bharatbala, for taking us on such a spirited and wonderful tale.|1
Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar decides they've got to go! Luckily Duchess has her secret weapon. A magical pearl that will save her family - if only Duchess can escape and find it in time... This book is written and illustrated by Jan Fearnley, and is part of the Animal Tales range. It has 32 pages, and was published by Oxford University Press in 1994. It's the second in a series of books about a cat, which all take place in different historical periods.|0
The Snowqueen is one of the best love stories I have ever seen: much better and deeper than Luhrman's Romeo&Juliet or Spielberg's Titanic. Gerda's love impresses me every time, her search, her battle is exceptional. Gerda becomes a strong, loving woman throughout the movie. Kay is the poisoner of dark forces: the temptation. This story encourages me to fight like Gerda for the ONLY ONE, for the love of my life, for Mister Right. Patience is one of the keywords of this movie. I cry every time when I realize all the suffering of Gerda and Kay.|1
A well written screenplay . A moving story showing the middle class English at it 's best . Some great acting , especially the child and the lady playing her grand mother. The cast are great in this film, it was very interesting. I really enjoyed the plot, I felt that this was an emotional story and it really made me think about how it must feel to be in someone else’s shoes. I liked the style of this film, and it was really easy for me to watch. I thought this film was really moving and I would recommend watching it.|0
SPOILERS BELOW ` A Dog 's Life ' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing . In Charlie Chaplin 's A Dog 's Life the character of an abandoned baby , who spends his time in an orphanage , is shown as a character who is deprived of his basic rights of a family life . His experience of a life without love , affection and belongingness is the subject of this essay , which is a close scrutiny of a character in search of his lost identity . His journey to find his real self is akin to a journey of discovery as the plot develops in a series of incidents and episodes .|0
"""A Slight Case of Murder"" is an excellent TV movie, which is defiantly worth the price of a rental. William H. Macy is great as a movie critic who accidentally kills his mistress, and then has to try to conceal the crime. Although that may sound dark, the film is actually quite light hearted and funny, with many memorable lines (""Acting is harder than I thought- you ever see BODY HEAT? I think I owe Bill Hurt an apology"" and my personal favourite ""For next week answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day?"|1
"I have to offset all the terrible comments . I love this movie . I own the movie and the extended version. Mike - 05/04/2010 at 02:51
God this movie is horrible. Tamara - 11/29/2009 at 19:29
Was a good movie. And I'll have to say, as much as I liked that movie, I thought it was way too short. But, I'm glad it's finally here. I think. I don't really know. I don't want to get my hopes up. I'll be honest. I don't really understand what this documentary is about but I don't care."|0
"I've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since I first caught the trailer, and I'm so glad now that I have. It's truly a wonderful film. The actors are superb, the writing is fresh and real, the whole thing was just spot-on. I love James McAvoy in this, and I can't wait to see him in ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" movie this December. Romola Garai is wonderful too. Be sure to check her out in ""I Capture the Castle"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby,"" two of my favorite films."|1
"`` A Slight Case of Murder '' is an excellent TV movie , which is defiantly worth the price of rental or purchase . I am not a mystery fan and I found myself riveted by this production . I was surprised to learn it was directed by Clint Eastwood
It is very well acted and the story line is interesting . There are some very good twists and turns to this story and I think it will keep anyone's attention . I thought it was a wonderful piece of work by Mr. Eastwood . I was delighted to find this on Netflix Streaming."|0
"Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did.SPOILERS BELOW. Read only if you watch trailers or if you've already seen it:The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-dog-eyed Emily was ""It's Over. Dump her. Bad riddance."" For some reason, he stuck around. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. At times he needed to leave. But he stuck by her and let her live her life."|1
"This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I've seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80's South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it's depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the ""certain"" segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.It's strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today."|1
"As many of today's movies are guilty of, the plot isn't exactly stellar, the movie doesn't move anyone, and certainly this won't warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters' perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.Moving along, this ""buddy"" cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time."|1
This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I 've ever seen on film . I do not know what it is , what it is about , or where to find it on the web , but if any one knows , could they please fill me in ? I have searched , but have found no results so far . I just hope that it is not so rare , that I am unable to find it anywhere . I was just a kid , 10 or 11 when I saw it . It was in a 16mm shorts film that we rented from the local film rental shop .|0
"Certainly one of the most hilarious films of all time. Excellent original music, clever, heady...it's hard to be articulate about something this good. There isn't one character that you don't instantly love to watch- Myronex ""Putney, there's trouble in the black room!"" ""My name is Rufus."" The lines, thrown away left and right, are classics themselves, recalling Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialog is not of the formulaic set-up punchline variety. ""Putney, Myronex called you tasteless!"""|1
"The Paul Kersey of DEATH WISH 3 is very far removed from the Paul Kersey of the original film . If you remember the 1974 film then you will remember Kersey was a "" Conchie "" during the Korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution . Ten years later Kersey seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time . But I`ll overlook that gaffe because DW3 is the best of the sequels , lowlife scum bags get shot dead , burned alive , their teeth smashed , and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes ."|1
I thought this was movie was great, Richard Greico and Yasmine Bleeth have great chemistry in this movie. Yasmine Bleeth's character plays a women who has fallen head over heals in love with Richard Greico's character. They end up getting married and everything seems perfect except Yasmine Bleeth wants a baby more than anything, however she has a hard time trying to conceive. Richard Greico will do anything to make her happy, and will go to extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this movie, and it keeps you guessing.|1
These days , you rarely come by a kid 's show that does not involve 1 ) a preteen/teen pop/rock star; 2 ) a cartoon animal; 3 ) something that you could use to beat up somebody else. Usually it's #2 and #3 that'll be the draw for the younger viewer. But back in the 70's and 80's, not so much, and if you were to look at those kids shows, they'd be pretty tame compared to today's stuff. Now, there's always going to be some shows that just plain suck out there.|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash. He wasn't in the old rock 'n roll class of , let's say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades. Almost every single he put out was a hit.So, I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice.|1
"The movie is incredible, it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie. THe lines in the movie are great, such as ""Nothings to good for out friends"" and ""Its collection time Charlie collection time."" I can watch this movie over and over again and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel that when i watch this movie I want to go out and shoot down bad guys, If there is a movie that you don't want to miss its this one."|1
"""Hari om"" is an Indian greeting and the compelling title character of the film bearing this same name(played by the wedding planner from Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey through the heart of southern India. There's no ""Bend it like Beckham"" backdrops and stereotypes, and only slight salutes to the music and dancing of Bollywood (however, the soundtrack is well worth procuring), but rather, the feel that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through the use of dozens of local residents in each scene to augment the performance of the five professional actors."|1
"Charles Chaplin 's 'Shoulder Arms ' of 1918 was his longest film to date , though , at just over 39 minutes , it remains far short of the average length of a full-length feature film. This was Chaplin 's final film for Mutual , the distributor with whom he had been working for the past four years , and his only true feature-length comedy. The film opens with the title cards: ""Shoulder Arms - A Comedy of Heroes by Charles Chaplin"". A soldier ( Chaplin ) is in a barracks , waiting for the army to give him a rifle."|0
"*Could contain spoilers, read only after seeing last episode season 2* Think about it. The guys on the north pole? Center of the earth? Looking for abnormal magnetic behavior? They also said something about: ""did we miss it again?"" So there was another abnormality? Of course that was when the plain crashed! I think this whole Island is a setup. Set up by her daddy. She found out about it and is looking for her Desmond. How else can she know what to look for.So basically it's an Island in a magnetic shield."|1
"""D.O.A"" is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his caustic best; and Quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His then beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as is usually the case, doesn't really make much of an impact. The film is stylishly directed throughout, drawing on a number of influences to capture its 'seamy' feel. Would you credit that it's actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is superbly slick, from its innovative camerawork to its unabashed use of black and white photography."|1
For all those people who believe the dialog is worth something, and who appreciate a farce that is clever enough for you to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It is not a 'whodunit' for people who can't aren't able to follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid).Cornell teaches in Southern California, near the tar pits. He has not published a novel in four years, his wife is divorcing him, he drinks a bit much, and is blessed or cursed with caustic wit, which he freely dispenses to his students.|1
I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC. I've been looking for it ever since. It was haunting: visual, textural, sensual. This movie took me somewhere like a dream and I didn't care where. I will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze. I still remember the way it made me tilt my head. I remember my facial expression when I saw it. I didn't know what had happened when the movie was over, but I find life is that way. It didn't bother me.|1
This movie was great. It had everything a true action fan could want. Plenty of people getting shot and/or maimed, minimal romance involving sex, a hero that can be identified with, violence at many intervals instead of pointless plot storing up just one scene at the end, and villains that are just asking for it. Bronson appears to be at his lowest level of tolerancy in this film and it shows. Ed Lauter makes a great cop and was seamlessly worked into Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie doesn't involve a plot so boring or over-consuming that you watch this film once and never again.|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully around India and I want to go there now. The main actor..Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the movie. Apparently he was also in the movie..Monsoon Wedding. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character cracked me up...was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was great too. They were all great!|1
LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol' says it all. I used to watch this movie all the time as a kid; and even then I sensed the silliness of it all. The low budget, horrible acting and lame script was ever apparent back then. I watched it again yesterday and just couldn't stop laughing. It's so bad it's actually good lol. Like another reviewer said, it doesn't take itself seriously. There's no way one could look at this movie and say that the makers did so.|1
I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn't know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue.|1
Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films kick ass. This one is no exception. Kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through some good character development). The fight between Reno and the Hero was tight. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval-like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey, that is, I had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence.|1
"I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with ""The sound of Music"" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager."|1
This is a 100 % improvement over the dross of a third movie and it 's one hell of a way to bring a franchise out of a death spiral. I can't recommend this enough. What's the point of making a movie you know is not going to make it's budget back in a year? I'm not sure this was made to be a success, it was just made because someone gave them money and they took the money and made a film. The whole point is that they were going to film the entire movie in one take.|0
I loved this film , which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival . In March 2005 I was lucky to meet and talk with two of the three girls in this film - they are still in school now. The girl who was 15 in the film now works for an NGO in Mumbai . The 12-yr old is about to start high school. The 17-year old does not know what she wants to do, but is in high school and dreams of becoming a Bollywood star. The film is about these girls' lives, but is much more than the story of three young women.|0
This is a remake of the anime classic from the 80 's , and this one is even better . This film is based on the manga by Yoshihiro Takahashi and it is directed by the famous anime and manga director Hideki Anno who is also responsible for other masterpieces like 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' or 'End of Evangelion'. In 'Patlabor 2' , the second movie of this series there is a real threat of a war with the USA in the middle of the film, and a new type of Labor unit is being introduced that looks like a giant robot, but is much better.|0
This movie is true action at its finest , It does n't get any better then this . This is the 6th movie in the movie . It has a bit of everything . You will get to see all your favorites from the previous movie and some new ones. This movie was very well made , the directors had it down pat. You will have to see it to understand what I'm talking about. They really did n't over do it on this one. The story line goes as follows , The movie opens up with a young man named Peter Parker/Spider-Man who is still in High school.|0
Enchanting . The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad . It 's all just so good. It's wonderful to see such a great movie online. this movie is really great, I watched it again this morning and it still amazes me. I'm looking forward to watching more movies with great cast like this one. It could use more depth but it's ok for this one. no movie that could be as cool as that. It's just everything movie was great, actors just amazing!|0
The animation quality here is decidedly below par IMO, regardless of the age of the OAV. The plot itself makes sense, but the characters don't.This might sound picky, but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines, would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance, short-sightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie, but only when the team can be bothered to put them in, by and large the 'bioroids' (or whatever they are) are interchangeable with human characters.|1
"""Showtime"" is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he's a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz."|1
'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a fantastic film in itself. It is nothing like the book, which may disapoint its ardent followers. Yet, viewed on it's own, the film is a masterpiece. The views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either!! Nicolas Cage was brilliant-so different from his usual action hero type characters. Penelope cruz is superb and really holds the film together. I think that this film has to be judged as an indivdual project-not related to the book. Louis de Bernieres gave up rights to the film script, so the film is an interpretation of the director, john maddon.|1
Belonging to the subgenre of post-apocalyptic future films, it is a stylistic and very very intimate installment. The most noticed element of the film is its silence; no one speaks. I don't think Besson, despite what is evident in most of his later work, meant it as any kind of cool gimmick. I think what makes it so clever and so effective is the fact that with no other way of communicating, everyone has to read each other based on intuition and conveying of emotion, no matter how slight.|1
"The revelation here is Lana Turner 's dancing ability . Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub entertainer, we never see that side of her. She was 17 at the time of shooting, so she could have done a lot of the dance routines if they had insisted on her doing them. It is a pity that her career did not allow that to be the case. The movie is based loosely on the life of actress Lana Turner. 120 Min. 16:9
1983/2004, Color 6/21/04
This movie is a wonderful portrait of a young actress, who is trying to become famous and be discovered."|0
A very weird , psychedelic , esoteric , ( and did I say weird ? : ) experience.But on at least 2 points it's not accurate , and I want to make a point that I've never done any of the drugs mentioned in this video. Either way, this video is just another example that we shouldn't rely on people on the Internet to know about these kind of things, especially when you look at some of the other things that the narrator says in this video, especially when it comes to politics.|0
This series has a lot going for it with beautiful footage of the some of the most impressive underwater environments on the planet and an entertaining cast of marine life. Despite that, after a few weeks it starts to feel rather repetitive. The show has a limited amount of information to share, and the narrator (who doesn't really get to explore or even see much of any of the ocean) spends his time explaining the same thing repeatedly. You'll hear about how a dolphin swims and feeds, but it never moves from that point.|0
If you like who-dun-its , you will like this film , considered the best Italian detective story ( giallo ) ever made ! The cast is perfect for the period , the camera work is amazing ( for that time !) and the music fits perfectly the mood of the movie ! The plot is not really original ( as it is not for all the gialli of that period !) and I don't like that the bad guy got the girl in the end ( as it happened in all the other movies of that type ) but, all in all , this is the best example of that genre I ever saw !|0
Just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is superposed over the concert footage in places. This is true, and is the biggest flaw of this film. However, it isn't so often, or so bad, that one shouldn't see this video. If you are a Black Sabbath fan, you have to see this. Aside from having seen Black Sabbath in the Sevnties and early Eighties, I saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined OZZfest just like in this video.|1
Ever since they first came to the Outer Banks and filmed the movie (I have lived here my whole life), I have waited for this movie to come out. And I mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me, it was worth it.The movie is different from the book but in my eyes, it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book. In both I cried, there were moments that tore me up. I laughed and I smiled just as much.|1
Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.It's twistedly cute clever & dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia's other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn't say this Brad is trying to rip him off.He is just jumping in & adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate.|1
This movie is beautiful in all ways . It is visually stunning , and this is a good thing since it has no dialogue what-so-ever . The acting is all done with gestures , expressions , and movements . So if you are going to see this you better understand that you will get out of it exactly what you put in. This film takes place in a time that is not specified . I have a feeling it was not long after the Civil War because I noticed the men all had their hair very long and it would not have looked that way right after the war .|0
What an incredible story and what a beautiful film ! Hat 's off to Ben Daniels , Lavinia Currier and all the actors who made this possible ! It was such a privilege to watch it in my classroom ! The kids were enchanted . What a beautiful documentary. I would also like to buy a dvd of this film. I would also like to purchase a copy of the movie. How much is the dvd? We would all like a DVD! Wondering if there is a DVD version, would love to have for our library. Can I buy this on a DVD?|0
Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch. (MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university.|1
Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1.At first he goes to boot camp but ends up as a cook and has to deal with some spoiled rich kids who are serving in the military as punishment. There is a great scene where Charlie tries to teach them how to clean a mess hall which has to be seen to be truly understood. There is a lot more in this film including an interesting subplot of Charlie falling for an officer’s wife. If you can get a widescreen DVD then it is highly recommended.|0
Before I forget , let me say the artwork in here is outstanding . From garbage cans to the huge monsters. It's fantastic , I only have 2 nitpicks , first , I feel the monsters are to big . I love the artwork and I can clearly see the detail and work put in to making them but in my honest opinion they feel off . I have no idea what the scale of the world is so I can't really say how large they are supposed to be but to me I think they are too big compared to people .|0
Surprisingly effective British drama about two very different people who find common ground , and in particular the `` flowering`` of one in the presence of the other. At first sight, the characters are unlikely candidates for such growth, but as the film unfolds they both come to grips with the reality that neither of them will ever have a truly fulfilling relationship with another. The film is very realistic in its characterisations, which may be off putting for some viewers, but for a serious film lover this adds to the richness of the drama. I found it touching and poignant, and very satisfying overall.|0
"Telling the story wouldn't be the point at all, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like ""booné aww"" is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.Children's Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he's keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring."|1
This interesting film noir features three very good performances: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. The scenes between Sanders and Patrick are particularly outstanding. Demming, as the detective, is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of a Bogart. Had Humphrey played this part, we could have had a classic.Pace, location (a library), and atmosphere are all good. But there are a few plot holes. Sanders strongly fears Blackmer and the ruthless organization (Nazis) he represents. Yet after mistakenly killing Blackmer, Sanders seems to experience no anxiety or remorse.|1
I had heard of John Garfield , but , did n't know him . I loved this movie . I was very touched by his acting , especially the scenes with Patricia Collinge , his mother , I was moved by her performance too . A sad story , well told , I will be back to watch this one again , as I did with all your blog movies , thank you . Wishing all the members and their families happiness and prosperity in 2014. Thank you! And to you and yours. A truly great actor in his prime.|0
I really loved this movie and have spent several years trying to get it. It is just not available and it has not been on TV for many many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think how every person looks at something from different prespectives. Also we often don't appreciate something we have till it is no longer there.My 12 year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it.|1
"Just as in ""Columbo"" we see the fatality occur right at the beginning. What follows is an escalating web of lies, sex, blackmail, and murder. The investigating officer, Adam Arkin, is even somewhat of a fumbler, not unlike ""Columbo"". It is William H. Macy, as the movie critic suspect who carries the film. Constantly twisting and turning, the plot sends Macy deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his ""perfect crime"". William H. Macy fans will enjoy ""A Slight Case Of Murder"", as will those who like crime capers with all kinds of delicious possibilities."|1
We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film & Video Festival & liked it.This film delved into the fears and fantasies people have about their lives when they are in the audience, watching other people on stage. There are moments when you wish the film went even farther, and moments when you're not so sure that you wanted to go that far with it. It has a surreal quality that gives you pause. The acting is generally good, and there are a number of scenes where the audience is watching a scene and you wonder whether what you are watching is a play or the film itself.|0
"""Head"" is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968. The movie is a complete contradiction of the Monkees image. It presents the Monkees in a way their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Totally controlled by their producers, the Monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film pokes fun at their image, the entertainment industry, and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music. It's a movie well worth seeing over and over again."|1
This is what movies should aspire to . Funny without being totally stupid , a little sexy without having every other scene being an excuse for nudity or sexual encounters , action without overdoing it with explosions or fights . A good mix of humor , action and drama. The cast is really good , great performance by Samuel L. Jackson who looks like he had a lot fun with his part . The story is a bit weird and has some plot holes in it . A lot of characters are just there for a few seconds and then vanish . Overall a good movie that I would totally watch again .|0
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong. The movie centres around Bartely or B who has been rejected from all of his colleges- the actor who play B is very natural and makes his character seem real- and decides to create a pretend school so his parents stop harassing him. However loads of people see his fake website and join. Feeling their sorrows B can't turn them away much to the chagrin of his best mate.|1
Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be . Terrible acting ! Implausible scenerios ! Ridiculous deaths ! Continuity errors a plenty . The list goes on . But it’s the 3rd installment of what’s already a silly series . So you’ll be entertained . But it’ll be because you want to laugh at it . It’s that kind of movie . The one that makes you wonder how the hell it even came to be . I just don’t have a whole lot to say about Death Wish 3 that hasn’t been said many times before .|0
This is an example of what film school lecturers would call a good debut movie . It follows all the standard movie conventions: the main character is introduced to the audience as a lonely guy, who has no friends and has just moved to a new place, he gets to know his next door neighbour (who also happens to be the girl next door and is a hot chick) and so on. I am a bit biased when watching this movie since I am a sucker for these rom-coms, so it may have seemed better than it was, but this is a must-watch movie.|0
This is one of the best of the early `` Star Trek '' episodes , with Kirk and his crew being sent to the surface of a planet whose inhabitants look very much like ancient Vulcans. The reason for this is quite a mind blower, and it is one of the episodes that can stand on its own without any knowledge of the other episodes. 10/11/2006 (07:00 PM): This was the episode that made me watch the original Trek series. I grew up with Next Generation, and while I enjoyed it, I had never actually watched the original.|0
I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7 year old son is starting to get into them, so we've built up quite a collection, and this is one of my favourites. We first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that.Great characters, Phil Harris stealing the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind.|1
The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music . Filmmakers were re-thinking what was allowed, what could be achieved and how they should work. It was a fascinating time, and it was one that spawned all sorts of new ideas and techniques. One of the ways that this was achieved was through what was called ‘Cowboy’ Cinema. What Cowboy Cinema did was to take the Western and use it as a base to explore new narratives, experiment with form and create something new.|0
"This film, like much of their music, is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It is terrific and, in many ways, ahead of its time.The images are funny, disturbing, and at the very least, engaging. The music is amazing. This is not the ""candy pop"" sound they are unfortunately associated with. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt.HEAD, alone, should put The Monkees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there?"|1
The story starts out with a soldier being transported to a desert town then goes back in time to tell the tale of how he came to this place. He started out as an officer in Napoleon's army fighting in Egypt but became separated from his unit. After nearly starving and/or dying of thirst he came upon a leopard which somehow became his bosom buddy. It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal. All things do end however and the man decided it was necessary for him to leave the critter.|1
This is my favourite Columbo. Martin Landau (excellent!) plays twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Columbo is unusual because the usual murder scene at the beginning doesn't give you any clue to which one did it! Peter Falk is on form as usual in this episode written by Steven Bochco (who also wrote 'Murder by the Book', my second favourite episode). The supporting cast are great especially Julie Newmar (very under-rated) and Jeanette Nolan as the house keeper that Columbo just keeps on upsetting.|1
Do you liked `` Dead Man do n't wear Plaid '' ? What about `` Top Secret '' and `` Spies Like Us '' ? Do you also love the 80's soundtracks ? Well, you will like this EP. 4 new tracks for a retro-style electronic pop. A little bit of darkwave. A little bit of synthpop. A lot of love. Vinyl and cassete tapes are still available in the shop. Get them while you can! I’m not sure how this came to my attention but it did, and I just have to let you know, I really love this album.|0
"""Pearl Harbor, buddy."" This movie is brilliant! Sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi-million dollar comedy does, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable. I'm one that goes for silliness, much like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Airplane"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I have to say this easily ranks up there. Movies just aren't written with this kind of sporadic comedy anymore. Too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece!"|1
1969 was the year . New York City was the place . Putney Swoope was the second Robert Downey film . And it was directed by Robert Downey's dad, Robert Downey Sr. . And I think that's enough information to help you understand that this film is going to be something really fucking strange, and not in a bad way. Not in a bad way at all, but just different. It is a film about the life of Putney, an unsuccessful and untalented comedian, who goes from the top of the comedy world when his TV show becomes a smash to the bottom rung when it becomes a smash.|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see . The acting , writing and production values make it a great movie for anytime viewing . I wish they would rebroadcast this as I have been searching for this movie and I am not sure that I ever saw the whole movie . I would love for it to be rebroadcasted as I think it should be seen by as many folks as are able to enjoy it as I have enjoyed it on several occasions . . . I remember watching this movie 30 years ago when it was originally broadcast and it had a big impact.|0
Barbora Bobulova 's portrayal of Valeria in this story was entirely captivating and heart wrenching at the same time . I loved her and couldn't find fault with how she was played . I hope we see a lot more of her in this series because she was perfect in every way for the role of this young woman who lost her life . I think we have yet to see if this story ends in the real world as it did for her. I think it ends very differently and we are seeing only what she is experiencing in her last days.|0
Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics.|1
I've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months (maybe longer but not much). I was very infatuated with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good. Lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me. First my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like Youtube, that are generally funny, or of people getting hurt inadvertently (some intentionally).|1
I just thought I would add another observation, here. While there are a couple of visual sub-references, in this episode, to the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman Janice Rand; there is a special, physically tender, moment, toward the end. When the Enterprise is reversing at emergency warp speed in an attempt to outrun a possibly fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice, perhaps fearing that their life is about to come to a dramatic end, seeks comfort by placing her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder as they observe the aproaching instrument of their impending doom on the main viewer.|1
I 've been a fan of Rachael 's since the beginning of 30MM on the Food Network , so I was excited to see this book. Rachael is fun, entertaining and a very talented chef. This book has recipes for every occasion. I love Rachael's spunk and I can't wait to try some new recipes from this book. If you have never seen Rachael Ray's day time show on the food network, you'll just have to watch a few minutes, and that will be enough to get addicted. She really is fun and you can see her personality really does shine through with her show.|0
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, as just another patchwork of mindless violence. And while there is a fair amount of mayhem, DEATH WISH 3 is not that awful of an effort, particularly for fans of the series and its star.This time out, aging Charlie's Paul Kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good versus evil.|1
Hey look, you don't watch this movie to change your life! But if you are female especially and have always had a little thing for Richard Gere; this movie is right up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere have on screen chemistry going way back. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not a Oscar winner movie and it will probably be forgotten sooner rather than later but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED good looking people (they don't make your stomach turn and even when Gere is 'on top' he does not look too jowly) then this is the movie for you.|1
I still can't describe what to feel when I received this by the fnac site. Such a rare movie, so little spoken and known, is difficult to find, even to fans, but the contrast betwen past and present is devastating: now I hold a DVD of the movie, with the finest quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought by the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my dvd and tv turned off, and marveled at the experience. I didn't know what to expect.|1
"Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war . The rain of bullets and bombs is choreographed by the master of cinema to produce a daring and beautiful film. Winner of Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor, the film was nominated for three others, including Best Film and Best Cinematography, where it was unsurprisingly beaten by WWI-rival film ""Wings"". The film was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Film Promoting International Understanding. It lost to ""Mata Hari""."|0
I am a long time fan of Luc Besson 's work , and for about as long as I 've been following him this film has been a passion project. His films are always visually pleasing and action packed , and I can say without hesitation that The Fifth Element will always have a high spot on my favorite movie list. I had read that there would be a short film based on this book, and when it was announced that the author would direct the short film there was little doubt it would have a lot of potential.|0
SPOILERSI love the Simpsons , and I have seen every single episode that had ever come out . I must say it is the best comic show I've ever seen . And there are a lot of other comic shows I've seen and enjoyed . That being said, I'd like to share my opinion as to what the best episodes are , according to me . Honorable mentions : The Principal of disaster , Bart Star , The Simpsons 138th episode Spectacular . 20 . The Italian Bob . Honorable mentions : A tale of two sprinklers , Little Girl in the big tenorman . 18 .|0
This was one of the worst Columbo episodes that I have seen , However , I am only in the 2nd season . I have seen a few episodes from the 2nd season that have been good , I have also seen some episodes from the first couple seasons of Columbo which have been outstanding , The 1st episode I saw is one I will always remember , I still remember the name of that episode also. I will not say what the episode is . But I think this was an episode that they could have made a whole movie about , Not that it was that long , just that it could have been expanded .|0
"This new installment to the Child 's Play series has not one scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes such as when Chucky says ""Hey I know what's funny let me tell you something scary"" and says ""I am funny"" and also ""I killed my wife I don't kill kids!"". This version of chucky is more fun than the previous ones so I rate it an 8.7. I really hope there is another Chucky film and I'm looking forward to it! This was the best and funniest Child's Play movie."|0
i love this film ! ! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is saying. this is one of my favourite films. i love the message and how it is presented. it really makes you think. it is a film that you want to watch again to pick up on missed parts. if you get a chance i really recommend that you watch it. i hope it inspires you as much as it did me. Loved this movie, even though I still can't understand why his dad would leave him and his mother.|0
"It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply . I 've been looking for reproductions for 1934 and 1935 3M tire advertisements . I did find one in 1936 but nothing before that . I'll have to use a photo from my 2 tires . I just bought a 225/16 Firestone tire to make a pattern. It was the only one I've found for my size, but it's only 2/32"" over the shoulder. I've had good results using the tire from the car (if it's the original size)."|0
Lucio Fulci 's `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' paints an exceptionally unflattering portrait of small-town Sicily plagued by mysterious child murders. It's an effective shocker in the vein of Dario Argento and Mario Bava, with a dash of ``The Wicker Man's'' Celtic mysticism, a few nods to ``Psycho,'' and more than a hint of ``The Devil's Rain.'' Fulci manages to build a great sense of tension, though the film's ultimate revelation seems to have been cribbed from a ``Tales From The Crypt'' cartoon. The movie is set in a fictional village called Accendura.|0
Great show ! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps . Contestants range in ages. It was funny to see my husband laughing and he usually doesn’t laugh at anything. I’m hoping the show is not rigged as most other reality TV shows. It will be an interesting to see if people watch. Hilarious! I can’t wait to watch the second episode! Wow, I’m sorry this is the first time I am hearing of this, I have to check it out soon.|0
I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, nor can I remember what it was that made me sit down in front of the television, tuned in to HBO, and watch this engaging biopic. What I remember was realizing that it was a (somewhat) true story, about someone who actually lived. I recall the music, great songs that I still love today (I can't believe Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stud!) Then, came the end.|1
No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese-level direction, but seriously, were you really expecting any of this? The only thing that matters is that this flick is absolutely hilarious, nearly on the same level as Borat. Sure, the ending drags a bit, but if Borat's cameo didn't crack you up, you must be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen is possibly the greatest comedian ALIVE, and here he gets more laughs than Jude Law on a nude beach.|1
"Valeria, an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it makes no difference of being completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a ""yes"", ""no"" or ""I don't know"". The way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent."|1
The movie has taken a little flack for playing fast and loose with the facts . But it will put more butts in the seats than any other movie currently in theaters, no doubt . I can’t even imagine what people are going to do for Halloween this year . Maybe we could all just agree on one big theme and be like the Village people. This is going to be one of those posts that is going to seem like a rambling mess. But I think I’ll be a better man for having posted it.|0
WTF ! ! Do any of his books/movies end in a happy ending ? ? The Notebook was good ... the rest were shit. The only thing good about it was that he died, but I can’t say that I shed any tears over his demise. He died on my birthday too. But it was the day after. I didn't think of it that way. Hmmm, I have to change my birthday... He's probably in a better place now. If there is one at all. There is no better place.|0
I never heard of architect , Louis Kahn , until this documentary . In this almost two hour documentary which was filmed during Kahn 's lifetime , we are taken from his early childhood and his development into a prominent Architect . We also get to travel to various locations that Kahn was involved with and get to hear some of the people that was involved with some of his more important works . The film has some very nice shots of his early works and the narration was well done with a variety of opinions about Kahn as an architect.|0
"If you are looking for a phony Hollywood action movie, this won't be one for you. If the Truth is what you seek, rent or buy this. From a true story, the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was/is happening in South Africa (and many other places).For historical knowledge, this rates up there with stories such as ""The Pianist,"" ""Schindler's List"" or ""Nuremberg."" Millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists. This movie may help them learn, and may even help them dig deeper."|1
Too bad somebody did not have the smarts to release this movie to theaters. I had never heard of it when it appeared on cable. After the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since Bringing Up Baby you have to let it sweep you along and run with it. Not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant. Alienation, denial, wish-fulfillment, for a start. Cathy Bates owns this movie, she's never been better.|1
The show start out with the boat . Desmond was i it . Then they went to try to save Penny. The end up at the same spot where Desmond was . Desmond and Penny are on the island. He said that he found it but that they didn’t find it. He said he had a boat to get out of the island . But he got on the island because he thought Penny was dead and that was his punishment . Then they found the polar bear . They killed the polar bear so they didn’t run out of food .|0
As with so many modern US films, there has to be a supernatural element to the plot, but if you just let that go, this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell.We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about. Beau Bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase, a nil bank balance and a brother-in-law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose.|1
This movie was great . It had everything a true action fan could want . Plenty of people getting shot and blown up. Great fistfights , chases . A true action film . I hope this film gets a follow-up . This Movie Is Good. It's The First Time I've Seen This Action Star But I Think He Can Be Great. The Action Is Great And I Like How The Ends Not What You Expect. This movie was great it was all action and it was awesome if you like action you will love this movie and it will keep your attention throughout the entire movie.|0
`` Head '' is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 . The film had a lot of buzz at the time it came out . The film had a lot to do with politics . I can see why this film is still a hit today because of the cast , which included a lot of great stars . I think the film is still as good as when it came out in the theater . The film will never get old , and I will never get bored with this movie. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a film that has a great storyline behind it.|0
First of all i want to say Ang Lee Did a very good job on this one ! I watched this in the cinema with my family and every one of us loved this movie !! i even recommended this movie for my friend and he liked it a lots too, he even told me that i should recommend him this one, i told him that i have a good news for you and i'm going to do it right now, i hope you going to like it and that you're going to thank me for this recommendation.|0
I know this movie isn't for everyone, and I won't push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie...It was the best I have ever seen!!! It was soooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I had ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat, because I didn't know what was gonna happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you have got to see this one!|1
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie borough a very controversial and interesting character to life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (maybe the most) famous Korean artist and continues to be revered as a master. Given the tumult of the time in which he painted and his own conflicted nature, it is amazing that he produced so much work, in so many styles and with such skill.|1
The best thing from the American Pie `` bakery . '' I found the humor and the plot to be funny. But the movie is good for only 10 years olds to 12. Other then that if your over that age this movie would be no good for you. Over all this is an average movie for its time . It has a good plot , and good character acting . But the acting could have been more dramatic if they had done more dramatic scenes. The main character Jim (Jason Biggs ), was pretty good.|0
I gave it a seven only because the acting is good . And of course by that I mean Wilkinson who I think was amazing in this film . I didn’t like the way the story was written at all, I felt as if I had been on a roller coaster that didn’t reach its climax, I felt cheated to be honest . So I think I might give it a 7.5 if that’s allowed . I don’t want to see something like that happen to any other great actors ever again . They’ve lost my faith .|0
"The revelation here is Lana Turner's dancing ability. Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film.So, viewers take notice! Here, MGM were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet, and were, therefore, consigning her to everything from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire.In ""Two Girls on Broadway,"" however, she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number, ""My Wonderful One, Let's Dance."""|1
"Is this a good movie ? It 's hard to say -- but in 1953 , for many people , it was an answer. It 's an answer today to many of our questions. And the movie is now on DVD -- and that means that we can see it on a big screen instead of a 2 inch television screen. I can 't say how the picture looks -- I haven 't seen it yet. I can only say that for many people the film is a window into their past . ""Humans can live for two weeks without eating."|0
by TyNesha Mells . In this drama , Ja Rule , who stars as Reggie , struggles with the loss of his wife and baby daughter . After his best friend ( played by Vivica A Fox ) leaves him, he decides to take his own life. On his way to the roof of the building he is staying at, he runs into a stranger named Dante , who is also contemplating suicide. The two men exchange stories and thoughts and come to a mutual agreement of wanting to end their own lives that night.|0
I always liked this movie , I have seen it so many times but I always enjoyed it : ) It's funny, I have even seen this movie when it was new so it must be a long time since I liked it. This one is also very good, the music is nice, the clothes are nice. It's really a beautiful movie. I love this film, I watch everytime I have the chance. This movie is very special for me.I watched many times, I love this film so much. One of my favorite movie.|0
If you have n't seen this film , do it . Its a genremix as i 've never seen another movie like that. If you love Sci-Fi , do it and if you love comedy , do it and if you love drama ... do it too ! If you have time and you didn't watch this movie, go ahead and watch it!!! This is one of my all time favorite movies!!! I love that movie. One of the few I've seen that can make me cry. And this is my favorite part. Awesome movie.|0
Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It's all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he'll see the Snow Queen is not so bad.|1
I've got to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. If it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par. I recommend the film but just barely.The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? How come Buddy's producer Petty ignored? Where are the daily trips to the Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the Holly sound?|1
I remember this film of old . It 's a great , chilling , atmospheric horror picture about a man who finds out that he is not really a man . I like the scene with the dead bird . I saw it years ago , it 's an interesting , entertaining film , but it does not have much replay value . I have a question about this movie . When did the old man ( Mr. Brenner ) found out he wasn ' t really a man ? Or did he found out he ' s not really a man when he found the skeleton of a man that he was before ?|0
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink, and that’s as far as Holly’s story starts for the audience. In fact, the film begins with the last show of his tour with the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens. The audience is given a small amount of background on the singer, who was born in Lubbock, Texas, and raised by a single mother. The first hint of his talent comes when he is singing along with a record while driving his mother’s car, and ends up with the car in a ditch.|0
"Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde.Michael McGuire was the dad.Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon.Did you even see this movie? Sorry. I've never seen it. But I like Mark Blankfeld. He's a very underrated actor, especially in comedy. You really should see this movie. It's very funny, especially the ending and the scene in the operating room. Mark Blankfield was on ""Love,American Style"" a long time ago. This was the second episode for that series with a comical storyline. It was about a guy dating a girl and he is afraid of her dog."|0
Charles Chaplin's 'Shoulder Arms' of 1918 was his longest film to date, though, at just over 45 minutes in length, it was not quite a feature film. With World War One just drawing to a close, many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so the lovable Tramp went to war! The film begins with the Tramp in training, and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills, including marching and gun-slinging, much to the disgust of his drill sergeant.|1
"I remember this film of old. It's a great, chilling, atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a Scottish castle, only to discover that there are strange goings-on in the corridors at night. And there are even stranger events taking place out back, in Hollywood's most familiar hedge maze. Yes, this is the maze you've seen in every feature-length film that ever involved a topiary puzzle, up to and including ""The Shining."" But the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess. I certainly didn't see it coming."|1
If you like who-dun-its, you will like this film, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci has done.It's not Mickey Spillane for sure. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone.Many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked nonetheless, and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones. She also tries to tempt the local priest.Young boys are turning up missing, and there are several interesting suspects. You have to watch carefully to discover the killer. Can you?|1
There are a select few cartoon films where animals or something `` not human '' is portraying human beings and their way of life; these movies include `` Babe, '' `` Charlotte's Web, '' `` Babe II: Pig in the City, '' and `` Stuart Little.'' This essay will compare and contrast these three films and discuss how they portray human beings and the world around them. Firstly, let's have a look at `` Babe, '' which is a film about a pig who becomes friends with many other farm animals.|0
This searing drama based on a true incident concerns several ambitious African nationals who decide to temporarily leave their families behind to travel to Britain to work and raise money so that they can build a new future for their families back home. But in England the immigrants are exploited by British employers for their work, and soon discover that it will take much longer than originally expected for them to return home. Born in the Ivory Coast and raised by an African mother and French father, Alain Gomis was educated at the French film school, La fémis.|0
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow. It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the leads, the steadiness of the camera-work (avoiding 'rock-video' clichés that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), tight editing, and a non-judgmental presentation of the star as human being rather than symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and incidental details that are a little unnecessary, and there will always be debate between families of those personally involved as to specifics.|1
"i did not read the book. nor do i care to. the movie was a beautiful romance, and i think women will enjoy it. no, it was not a ""10"" film, but it was enjoyable. women, if your man is bored as mine was, then watch it yourself. hurt is wonderful as the philosophic doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on ""in love"" and ""loving. ""also, if you like nick cage, he was terrific and funny. i enjoyed watching the developing romance. also, if you like Christian bale -- do see him in equilibrium."|1
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True, his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production, but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror.|1
Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne 's `` For The Flag '' by the Czech master director Karel Zeman. Set in the South Pole, an airship carrying an international group of scientists to the pole is sabotaged. One of the saboteurs is the ship captain's estranged son. The captain is played by Karel Langer, who is also the star of the earlier ``The Fabulous World Of Jules Verne''. The movie has all the usual Karel Zeman effects, with wonderful miniature work and puppetry of the animals and people. The score is by composer Karel Soucky.|0
Another go round with the monkey king going west .... sort of.Beginning in the middle of some action the movie jumps around a bit with characters and story lines as if we were meant to see the whole thing first then go back and fill in. It was entertaining though and I liked the way they were able to weave real life events into the script. Not sure if it's because the director was too busy or if it's a lack of money or what but I think it would've been better to keep the focus on a single person.|0
`` I am ... proud of 'Head ' , '' Mike Nesmith has said . He should be , because it has taken a long time to come up with it , and in some cases it has been a lonely business . Even in a group that has split up , it isn't easy. For a year he has been recording this album of his songs with the same group of top musicians - and he is still not satisfied - and now he is trying to decide which way to go. But it is a good album .|0
Ah the Outer Limits . I love that show . It was surpremely creepy , or down-right mysterious . I have seen many of those episodes in rerun . I saw the Outer Limits many years ago, but I remember it was one of those programs that scared you to the point where you couldn't sleep without the lights on, especially when you were a kid. But I also remember that the stories made you think, even if they were scary. It is hard to believe that it is still on the air 46 years after its first broadcast.|0
"When the Romulans come, they will not be bearing gifts; no, they bring with them war - war and conquest. As any familiar with this episode know, it is a redux of the war film ""The Enemy Below"" from the fifties. The obvious difference is that instead of a battleship and a submarine (or an American Destroyer & German U-boat) engaged in lethal war games, it is two starships in outer space. In Trek history, about 100 years before the events here, according to this episode, Earth fought the Romulan Wars."|1
I think that this short TV series, was absolutely wonderful, and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time. This was by far David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade. This is definitely worth peoples money!I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part. It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life!|1
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented.|1
This film had about everything one could wish when viewing it originally, at the end of the 1960's decade. It was immensely entertaining, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes which had occurred during that period - and were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement which followed the quieter, preceding postwar 1950's.All of this and one of the funniest films, then or now.Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as engrossing as when seen originally.|1
Years ago when I first read John Irving's The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn't like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a déjà vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer.|1
`` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is one of the coolest Italian horror films I 've ever seen , and I am not saying this because of the fact it 's from Italy . First of , let 's talk about the story . Well , it 's kind of hard to sum it up without spoiling too much of it , but the main plot revolves around a young girl who was born without an eyesight . She goes to a local school along with her older brother , who is also not a very bright guy .|0
`` Live Together , Die Alone '' is divided into three main story lines , and each one of them is focused on the three main characters. First we see Michael ( Harold Perrineau ) being interviewed by some government agents and we find out about the events that led to his surviving the crash on the island . He was on the plane because he got a call from his ex-wife Walt ( Malcolm David kelley ) asking for help in locating Michael . After the crash , Michael was separated from Walt, but eventually he got back to the wrecked plane and found him.|0
An interesting look at the immigrant experience , told as a fable with some very weird imagery.I got drawn to the title because I'm in the midst of writing an immigrant story. I'm also an immigrant to a new country, and this novel resonated for me in so many ways I'd be hard-pressed not to recommend it to anyone interested in the immigrant experience.The novel is narrated in first person, by a young, unnamed Mexican boy, who, with his family, sets out for the United States, where, his mother has been assured, they will be able to make a better life.|0
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort , and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. The Little Tramp is called back to action in the second installment of this World War I comedy. After the Germans capture his wife (Edna Purviance), Chaplin’s Tramp rescues her with the help of the U.S. army, and then enlists himself in the war effort. As in the first installment, Chaplin’s Tramp is at his best, using his wit and charm to outwit his foes and make the most of his situation.|0
I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci 's reputation as a director . Too often he 's been considered just an exploitation artist who had no respect for the craft, and this is just too damned wrong. I think he 's been considered this way because of the fact that he did make some very exploitive horror films for many years and he 's been compared to other exploitive Italian horror directors from the 60 's - the likes of Bava and Mario Bava (though he never really got as much praise as they did.) But Fulci wasn 't exploitive like them.|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best episode of the series. And, while I have always loved A PIECE OF THE ACTION because it is so much fun, I really do have to cast my vote as this Romulan episode as being the very best.The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a WWII submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked Romulan ship and the Enterprise as it seeks to destroy the Romulans before they sneak back across the Neutral Zone after a raid on Federation outposts.|1
I can't get this flick off my brain. It's definitely totally different than anything that's out there. I've seen a ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way BlindSpot did. There is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together. It's like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty f****ing hilarious black humour. Franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in a few scenes, like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave.|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. This is a haunting tale of loneliness & missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another. The three leads (Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo) are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising. After all the movies which devalue older women, it's wonderful to see Flavia (who is a law professor at a university in Rome) presented as beautiful & sensual as well as seductive & powerful.|1
"I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in ""The Boyfriend""."|1
Based on a William Faulkner short story , Two Soldiers is a top notch short film , a movie that is worth every second of it's running time . There is not a lot of dialogue and most of what is spoken by the two actors is in Spanish . The story revolves around the relationship between two soldiers who are on a mission in Mexico during the time of the Mexican revolution . One of them is on his way out , and while the other is young and full of optimism . The two main characters here are fantastic .|0
Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in Curb Your Enthusiasm, his screen persona is hilarious; but in addition we get to see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability that makes the story universal. While the film chronicles his character's dreams of love, performing success, and weight loss, it will appeal to anyone who dreams of a better life. The supporting cast brings the frustrations and joys of his life to the screen in funny and heartbreaking ways. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying once again once life has disappointed us are all themes.|1
"Yes, at times ""Unconditional Love"" overwhelms as it bounces -- no, as it ricochets -- from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I watched the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan might have been attempting to do with this quirky, unconventional flick. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the later part of the film."|1
Accepted is a 2006 teen flick that stars the guy from the mac and PC ads . The movie is about this kid who gets dumped by all the Ivy League schools. He gets admitted into this lesser known college where he thinks his dreams are over. He meets a bunch of other misfits who have also gotten rejected by the same colleges. They decide to start a secret society, only they call it an “accepted society” which is basically a society of outcasts. They have a series of misadventures and of course in the end they succeed in everything.|0

But upon arriving, Kate is dismayed to discover that Susan has already left, and a man named Peter has taken refuge from a storm there. Kate and Peter strike up a friendship...and soon find themselves growing closer...
Peter is a charmer. There's a lot to like about him. Kate and Peter don't know each other. Their first meeting is because of the weather and they end up talking."|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy ( Garlin ) wandering around Chicago with his pal in tow. He's unemployed, uninspired, unkempt, unhappy— and unconcerned about any of them. But Garlin gets a little help when he decides to befriend the 5-year-old kid of a recently divorced friend. They're both lonely and sad, but with a kid around to keep him company, Garlin rediscovers the joy in life. Garlin's comic timing is dead-on throughout, while his performance is subtle and understated.|0
When his elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her lodger Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibalistic monster, TV news reporter Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her hunger.Although the above plot summary conjures up images of trashy, over-the-top, 80s horror titles such as Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be a refreshingly original take on the werewolf/vampire/zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it ain't nice!|1
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative.|1
I saw this movie when it first came out in 1973 and loved it . Since then I 've searched for it to watch. Finally found it today and it is just as great as when I first saw it . It is a movie that I can and do watch several times a year. It is so good in that you can watch it and discover new things every time. I highly recommend this movie to any one and everyone. I enjoyed this movie. I think it was a good movie. I love this movie and it was very funny in some ways.|0
"Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime,despite betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is no brutal Othello, in the setting of modern day England. So, gradually a web of deceit begins to be woven. And, we witness cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of ""separate lies"" begins to fail and then hold together again. And life (and death) goes on, despite the bright flame of the husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives."|1
What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly!|1
I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. (Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully.The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life.|1
inspite of many movies dealing with great artists or a genius , chihaweseon pointed out the real dilemma in which the artist has been caught . The story revolves around Van Gogh - a very talented artist who never made his work public . His work was appreciated only after his life . The story shows the pain of the artist which he was unable to show to his near and dear due to his psychiatric condition . A great movie with a great music . Movies which makes you think and introspect are a delight to watch and the more you think the more you get to know yourself and life .|0
A mix of 70 's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line . As I 've read the first few pages the book seems to be good and worth a read . The first page itself has a sense of humor and keeps the reader wanting to read more pages . It is quite difficult to get through the initial chapters . I was confused with the way the author writes . But after the initial few pages it becomes a page turner . The book has many twists and turns making it more interesting. There are few parts that can make you laugh out loud .|0
I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas.|1
"Oh my word!! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged execution. Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Bronson, but he also shows us the spoon he's feeding us with and says ""look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question: Are you enjoying this?"""|1
I admit to being in awe of the Sea and have spent a number of years in the Navy, so I am somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out but nagged various people to buy me it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the film is amazing and I have a lot of respect for those who make these kinds of documentaries, to see 200 ton Blue Whales 'cruising' through the Sea is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines.|1
To say the truth , I went to see this movie only because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor . However, the movie was very nice , especially the ending was beautiful . What makes a movie a masterpiece ? I believe that a masterpiece is more than an average movie , it’s something unique that will stay in the spectator’s mind for ever , it’s like a dream . In my case , I will never forget about this beautiful movie . I watched this film in a language I don’t know, so some parts were a little bit confusing .|0
Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918 , a doughboy who can not seem to get the attention of his beloved. He does not care for the film itself but he likes the fact that he finally is the lead in a film which he wrote and directed. I think it should be noted that Chaplin was one of the only stars that did not go over the top to get the public's attention. He didn't try to get out of the army and he didn't go on stage tours when the USO did them.|0
This is a stunning movie. Raw and sublimely moving. It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences. All of the main players are mesmerising. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. He's a national treasure.|1
Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he's operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They're all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.This is what's known as a weepie or a woman's film.|1
This is a funny movie . The Bob & Eddie Show feel of it could lead to a sequel but I am glad it was not one of those movies . It's a feel good movie . Went to see this and it wasn't that great of a film . The only saving grace was Chris Pine. I did like the scene where he was a waiter at a wedding . That was good. But everything else about it was just plain dull. The best movie i saw at the cinema in the 2010's decade. It's funny but also has a good plot with some drama.|0
"Coming from the ""druggie"" generation, I thought this movie was hilarious. It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde up-to-date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way through it. Would love to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it. They aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long since I've seen it I can't remember but a few things."|1
"It took me a while to find this movie since they don't have it yet on DVD (and my VCR is not worth hooking up again). I guess all the referencing to drug use is too much for some folks. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just retarded. It is a slap stick spoof in the vein of ""Airplane."" I must say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight growing up in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor a whole lot more then, than I do now."|1
"I do n't see what the problem is with SOME people and their NEED for intellectual humor . You need it , then fine . But please keep it to yourself . I know that you will find it difficult to understand this but NOT EVERYONE HAS THE TIME TO BE A COMEDIAN ! It is not a requirement or a condition to be human , and I will tell you WHY :
If you do n't get it , that's fine . Don't try to be a comedian because you do not need to be . It's not necessary ."|0
Not a stunner , but a good movie to see once or twice . Bill Macy shows he can do more than a comedy . This is a great story and very entertaining. I had not seen this movie in a few years, and I loved it still. I love movies with great casts, and this one is not an exception. A very well-made movie. Not great, but has a certain charm that kept me interested to the end. Great cast, but I felt they were a little wasted. A great movie that isn't shown nearly enough anymore.|0
Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards, My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father, the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974, when Nate was 11 years old, leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings, and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic, but selfish and emotionally immature genius.|1
Most critics seem to have dismissed this film , like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles , as just another routine cop thriller. Not so ! There is plenty of tension throughout this 1974 movie and a fair share of action. Bronson plays a tough but honest New York street cop who is transferred to Los Angeles after shooting a corrupt colleague in cold blood. There he is put on an assignment of infiltrating a gang of drug pushing hippies, who have in their possession several kilos of high quality heroin and are led by Karen ( Jill Ireland).|0
"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that came from it was this movie, ""Take it to Limit"" Right as the movie started, we could tell we were in for a true classic. The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado, but it sounds just like early 90's rap. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad-boy so well, especially sporting a big zit the entire movie."|1
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour. In 1969, the transition among African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still quite new, and more than a little controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the Establishment and the Anti-establishment as the caricatures they often closely approximated in real life. Special mention should be made of Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery.|1
Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the last. The final one of course had to be a western and it has a great cast and is well worth watching. Glenn Ford, George Hamilton, James Caan, Arthur Kennedy, Robert Vaughn, John Marley, Andrew Prine, and a long list of other greats make this a very enjoyable film and it has some really good action in it too. I know that Glenn Ford had a great career in westerns and his last one was The Appaloosa , but I like this one better.|0
I saw this movie on it 's opening night , and enjoyed it . I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more had I not seen it after the first 3 movies in the Jurassic World series . This movie was a little different in that the dinosaurs didn't always seem to be the main target of the bad guys , sometimes it was the main characters instead. I did think the story line was good , it was just the action sequences where they kept changing the story back and forth with the fight scenes that left me confused a couple of times .|0
I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age. So I can imagine what must have been going through your head when the news was relayed to you. Thank you. He was my first rock star hero. A wonderful and very special tribute. Thanks. This is the best I have read. I was there. I can tell you that this is exactly what happened. Thank you for taking me there. I’d love to see your pictures, too. I don’t know why but this really hit home.|0
"I do n't see that much wrong with this movie . Granted , the principal singers might not be Luciano or Callas , but the rest of the cast is very good . The movie is a bit dated , yes , but so what ? The scenery is pretty and the costumes are nice . If you can overlook a few minor flaws you might just enjoy this one . A really good adaptation of Puccini's great opera. This film adaptation of Giacomo Puccini's ""Madame Butterfly"" is quite good. It has been well-envisioned and well-directed by Richard Fleischer."|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method ('sketching' poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and its fantastic beauty) and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination.The film integrated excerpts of Miyazawa's poems into the plot beautifully. His relationships with his students was powerful, especially in one scene where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing materials from the classroom.|1
This movie gives us some WWII history along with some touching romance , a little fantasy and meaningful emotion - all rolled into a package that is easy to enjoy and well worth the time! It is set during the last winter of WWI, 1918, and is about an unlikely romance between a British soldier and an actress at a London theatre (the real Theatre Royal). The real theatre has been around since 1812 and has hosted a variety of acts from Shakespeare to rock music. It was the home for some of the most famous stage actors of their day including Charles Dance and Diana Rigg.|0
The movie does n't take itself seriously , and if you follow its lead you 're going to have a good time watching it . The cast is very young , but all the main actors did great jobs , and even the villain in this story was good . The movie is a mix between spy films and comedies . But at the end of the day it 's not a great movie , but it 's one of those enjoyable films that you can watch with your family and friends . A very entertaining action film. I watched it with my brother who was very entertained by it.|0
When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American movie done on the cheap with appalling special effects. How wrong was I? This is actually quite a fun little sci-fi movie. There is some terrible CGI, but nothing really that bad and the movie does still have a low budget and looks like it. The story of this movie is quite simple. A ship is flying through space on a routine mission and it comes across a distress call. The ship answers the call, thinking it might be in trouble.|0
When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel,I have to say out of all the shows that I've seen that ADV released,this one is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again,and that's when I got my chance. I bought the entire box set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th Birthday. And I got to enjoy it,and see more of the episodes that I missed on Action Channel,and the same 3 episodes that I've seen.|1
Lucio Fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. While Don't Torture a Duckling was made before Fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn't all that gory; it's certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that Fulci ever made! Don't Torture a Duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the Giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of Fulci's later films, everything about this Giallo is great.|1
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film, The Life of Jimmy Dolan which starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as the prizefighter on the lam.Even with the restrictions now upon production by the Hays Office, this remake actually turns out to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is horribly miscast as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play.They Made Me a Criminal was directed by Busby Berkeley who Jack Warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals. Berkeley in fact would soon be leaving Warner Brothers for MGM.|1
I love the TV contest . Hate to see it end . There are so many talented contestants . It was nice that the judges were complimentary and positive about the contestants instead of being mean . I love watching this show every week and am very sad that it has been cancelled. There are so many people out there with talents that they don’t always know they have and this show helps them know they can achieve so much more than they thought! I hope another channel picks this up soon so we all can watch it again as I hate to miss out on the next season of this show.|0
"What a shame this movie was never released. (It is now playing on cable.) I tuned in based on my high regard for the stars and was rewarded by seeing a movie far better than the ones I've been paying to see in theatres recently. I like to be surprised. So often movies are marketed as ""offbeat,"" but are in fact more of the same old recycled drivel. This movie is genuinely different, with the bonus of a heartwarming message. Jonathan Pryce sings like an angel."|1
"The cover of the VHS says it all : `` Without doubt , the most powerful movie of its kind !``
The movie begins with a narrator talking about the story of the 70's (and 80's) underground fanzines that were published all over the world and that had in common the idea to oppose the mainstream media, to question the consumerism of today's society by promoting countercultures and alternative ways. The first part of the film takes a look on the fanzines themselves by interviewing people that were involved in fanzines and collectives. After that, the interviews begin to be mainly focused on music."|0
"This movie is an awesome remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh? !Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect! !Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him."|1
My favorite show of all time! Yeah, I thought this was so cool, and Larisa Oleynik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny-except when it it wanted to be serious, and just a great show overall. But since we couldn't afford to keep Nick, I couldn't see any episodes after Feb. 1996, and maybe that makes me think more of the show than I should. To me it's more the epidemy (now that doesn't look spelled right!)|1
Being a middle aged mom myself, I very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown-up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us. Diane Lane beautifully portrays Adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through, wanting to do what is right for her children, but still have a happy life herself. I am not a big Richard Gere fan, but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk, but learns something about himself.Criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies.|1
"Jack , Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond . His traumatic past experience has come back to haunt him , he is very upset that the boat was taken by Locke and Jin . Jack tells him about the Dharma food drop and they decide to go and get it . Jack tells Sawyer about Kate's pregnancy and Sawyer says that he has always had faith in Kate's ability to look after herself . He reminds Jack that he's the one who has always told him to ""let her do her thing "" and now he's not doing it ."|0
This is a stunning movie . Raw and sublimely moving . It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play . And the performances , the music , the set designs , the cinematography , the lighting , the makeup , all were first rate . There is nothing not to like . The only problem with the film that I found is that it could have been tighter and had more of an ending . I felt like some things weren't tied up and just sort of ended . But , I loved it . I can't stop thinking about it . 9.3 / 10 .|0
If you 've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts , here is a Zasu zinger ! In 1933 , MGM , as part of the studio's series of all-star revues , had a film called Hollywood Party , which featured , amongst others , Jimmy Durante , Joan Blondell , Glenda Farrell , Franklin Pangborn , The Three Stooges and Zasu Pitts . Zasu played a maid and the only thing she did was to fall down the stairs ! When you see that fall , you will know exactly what she did ! I saw this movie when it came out on VHS , in the early 80s , I think .|0
Pierre Jolivet plays a Don Quixote character , unable to speak , living in a world incompatible with modern life. The film , directed by Jean Becker, with a script by Olivier Assayas and Jacques Fieschi , is set to be released in France on May 29. A new film , from 28 to 30 April, will be the subject of the film “Don Quixote ” starring Gerard Depardieu. The film was shot in Catalonia (Barcelona, ​​Sitges, ​​Tarragona) and is based on Don Quixote , with some modern elements .|0
While I agree that this movie lacks any real substance and should not be taken seriously, its primarily directed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey)once again takes to the streets (given a license to kill by the chief police no less) and moves into his friends apartment (who you guessed it) was killed by a street gang that has taken control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of getting killed.|1
After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II would be all about the islanders and their heroics but, as the title indicates, this is more concerned with the soldiers who occupy the village. I'm not quite sure that the two sides are evenly balanced as it seems as though the Italians are a bit on the stereotypical side but that's only because they're so funny. I'd have loved to see more of them because they were all so great.|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!!|1
I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I 'm dying to know what the name of the movie was. It was a low budget movie but it was very good and it was about a guy that woke up one morning and found himself buried in the ground in a coffin with only his hands sticking out. I know, I know I know its a crappy description but its all I have. If you have any information on the name of the movie I will be eternally greatful. I have looked everywhere and I have found nothing.|0
"Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne's ""For The Flag"" by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety."|1
If you haven't seen this film, do it. Its a genremix as i've never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some hilarious funny stuff, a film noir felling, musical numbers with a swing, sex scenes (The 2nd best played orgasm on Film, bested only by Sally), a pitch of Orson Welles blended together into a work of art. As an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end, at least not logical for everybody ;-). I owned an tv copy on VHS but loaned it to an ex-girlfriend and now i can't get it back.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film . It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the feeling of the area. A family of four live happily together with their dog in a lovely big home. But the man of the house dies and leaves behind his young widow and children. He is mourned. But slowly his presence becomes a ghostly reminder of the lives they have led and the changes that must take place. The mother and the children must adapt. But she is not ready. She sees him in her home, at his fishing spot, out at work.|0
Spirit and Chaos is an artistic biopic of Miyazawa Kenji , a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the 1900s. It follows a fictional account of his youth, his life as a teacher and his sudden death through an imagined journey of his mind. We meet the younger Miyazawa living with his family in 1903 on the island of Shikoku. He has an uncanny ability to sense when the tides are high as well as a sense of awe of the elements, which leads to a strong sense of connection to nature.|0
"This is one of the best of the early ""Star Trek"" episodes, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, well-played by Paul Comi, is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the ""Star Trek"" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is eerily similar to the post-9/11 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin."|1
This was a riveting film , one that really drew me in . I 'm a big fan of William Hurt and this was a perfect fit for his talents . It was a well made film that was interesting from start to finish . I saw this movie a few months ago while I was visiting my parents for the weekend. I had seen the first trailer for it, but I really had no interest in watching it. After my sister and her boyfriend suggested it, I figured, why not give it a try. It turned out to be pretty good.|0
I just had the opportunity to see 'Nuovomondo ' ( hitherto known in the U.S. as 'The Golden Door ' ) and was impressed. It's directed by a newcomer, Italian actress Emanuele Crialese, based on a story by Maurizio Casagrande. I watched the Italian version subtitled in english, and noticed that there were 2 differences between it and the English version: in the U.S. version, there are some additional scenes, which do not affect the storyline, and also, the title is different. The Italian title means New World, whereas the U.S. title means Golden Door.|0
Duchess is a pretty white cat who lives with her three kittens in her wealthy owner 's mansion in Paris. When a little boy and girl from England arrive to stay with the Duchess' owner, everything changes. The little boy and girl are sent off to school and the Duchess is left to look after the mansion, but when the Duchess and her kittens realise they can sneak off to play with the little boy and girl, a whole new set of mischief begins. But will Duchess find her way back to the mansion before they are caught?|0

I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon . I loved the film from the moment I saw it and it stayed with me over the years as one of my favorite movies. I've always wanted to write about the story but never did until now that I've retired from my career. The story, which is still relevant and timely today, resonated with me as a metaphor for how we deal with the stresses and uncertainties of real life today and how we can better cope with our problems.|0
"LOL.The mere fact that I start off my review with 'lol ' says it all . I used to watch this movie when I was like nine and ten . I loved it ! It was so cool . I used to imitate Tina when we played . She was my favourite . I remember my dad giving me a hard time about it . He used to say , "" Why can't you make up a movie instead of watching this one , every time ? "" I'd be like , "" Why ? This is the best movie ever ."""|0
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life , the action was great , and i loved that the movie was set on the beach , it was really good , you should watch it , and tell me what you think. Awesome storyline that follows the book pretty closely which was a nice touch. The ending is not the same, but you will understand what I mean by watching this movie. I am going to give this one 5/5. I have watched it twice so far! This movie is very good.|0
Coming from the `` druggie '' generation , I thought this movie was hilarious . It definitely brought Jekyll & Hyde back into the mainstream . You don't have to be a sci-fi fan or a comic book nerd to find this movie appealing . The plot of the movie revolves around `` Mr. Hyde '' & how he goes around the world and takes all the drugs in the world to make himself strong as well as evil . He then comes to New York and starts killing people as well as stealing their brains . He wants to harvest the drugs in their brains and make himself even stronger .|0
"Well, what's wrong with the title ""Separate Lies"" (accused elsewhere of not being ""exciting""). It's cunning, subtle and a bit poetic. (Of course there's a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi film called ""Separate Lives"", which are alluded to here.) But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes. OK, it's not an ""in-your-face"" hilarious title, but then it's not an in-your-face hilarious film. Please give British films like this a chance."|1
"Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean ""good"", not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won't rot your teeth."|1
"Easily Lucio Fulci's most respected film, ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" is highly renowned for it's edgy subject matter, gruesome imagery, and strong storyline. Terror befalls a small Italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered, engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to most fan's frequent representation on the film's violent content - I consider it much more plot driven; featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and boards)."|1
"I can not say this movie was a hilarious , but I must have had a grin on my face from the beginning of the movie all the way til the end. This was my first time ever going to see a chick flick by myself ( not that i have a problem with that lol ) and I can honestly say that i am not ashamed of it. If I could, i would tell all my friends how great this movie is and how funny it is. Even if you do not particularly like the whole ""chick"" genre , you should go see it!"|0
"If you've never experienced the thing that is Zasu Pitts, here is a Zasu zinger! In 1933 Mae Questel caricatured Pitt's voice for the character Olive Oyl for the Fleischer Studios animated cartoon version of the comic strip Popeye. Zasu (pronounced Zay-Sue) does her best ""Olive Oyl"" impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ""ohhh myyyy"", but instead it's ""something always happens to somebody."" The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny."|1
This is a wonderful movie, and I still love it! It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family! I recommend it to people of all ages. I promise you will not be disappointed! The characters are always so engaging, so real, you will just love them! The story of Gerda and Kai falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your life.I don't see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book, I mean the movie was amazing! I haven't even read the book, and guess what?|1
"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great. Very good #1 was, #2-3 were throwaways, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle/tagline: ""Chucky Gets Lucky."" So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky."|1
"Always enjoyed ""DOA"",1950,which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film. Dennis Quaid,(Dexter Cornell), was a professor who loved his wife and finally found out she was having an affair with one of his students. Dexter gets involved with Meg Ryan(Sydney Fuller), who was a student in his college class and at the same time had a big crush on him and wound up having a one night stand and in some ways loved him deeply. Dexter learns that he received a drink which had bad contents and would cause him a great deal of health problems!"|1
A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Batman:TAS and its ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again, great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay, and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only qualm I had was Rob Paulsons voice seemed a little too old for the title character, but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great, and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending.|1
When `` Madame '' decides to let her cats inherit her it spells trouble . The snobbish Butler Edgar who has never liked the cats and thinks he should be running the house does not take this well. So he runs away taking the house with him . The cats who are in fact royal cats are determined to get the house back . They decide to hunt Edgar and get him back . But there are two cats that are different . One is an old fashioned tom cat and the other is a little girl cat .|0
"I don't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more ""Hollywood"". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film."|1
Years ago I read the book ' A Máquina ' ( The machine ) . As I re-read this little book and think that is a very good example of why we need more of this type of literature for children and teens , and not only for the youngest . There is the possibility of reading the book here, or watch the movie in YouTube below . I do not believe that this movie was made for a children's audience . I have also seen the other movie adaptation of this book with the title ' Cars ' from Disney .|0
**1/2 Elisha Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra.Yet another classic horror film remade with dunder-headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price film House of Wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures. Still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre later remade, despite creativity and so-so acting the movie was still just a gore picture.|1
All the characters in this cartoon were hilarious . Norman the Viking guardian had some memorable phrases and the skulls especially had some funny lines! This is one of my favorite episodes and I liked the music. The animation was great too! This is my favorite episode too, and I love this song too! What's yours? I was going to say the same thing as the other person. This song is catchy and I loved the animation. Was this episode in Season 4? I only saw it once and don't think I saw it again.|0
"I really enjoyed this film , it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat . It was very interesting to see what would happen in the end . It was a little confusing in the beginning but it all tied up in the end . A good family film ! I really wanted to like this film, but I had to stop watching it after an hour. It was very hard to understand, and there wasn't much of a plot. I'm sorry to say I wouldn't recommend it! I liked the fact that it was a ""good guy movie""."|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was . I was really surprised at the actors and how well they played their roles . This is a must see movie !! Great movie. Excellent acting from both the male and female leads. Good action and very good story line. A must see for all. I was impressed with the movie. I had high hopes for the movie. The beginning was great, but the end was a little lack luster. Excellent movie. I think I watched it 5 times. great action movie!|0
Always enjoyed `` DOA '' ,1950 , which starred Edmond O'Brien and was very curious about this film . Dennis O'Keefe , as well as Ann Sheridan , starred in it . It was very much like `` DOA '' , but with a few different twists . It did keep you riveted though . A great thriller / noir movie . I highly recommend it if you have not seen it before . I do have the `` DOA '' movie which I bought a year or two ago , so if you enjoy the movie you can purchase it , I highly recommend you do .|0
"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone."|1
What I enjoyed most in this film was the scenery of Corfu , being Greek I adore my country and especially the beautiful islands . The plot was good and entertaining but I didn’t find it believable and the acting was not brilliant . There were many funny moments in this film so it makes it worth a watch , the ending was not very good and it is a shame because this could have been a good romance film if it would have not had all the other stuff . This is one of those movies where, after a bit of time passes, everything comes back together.|0
I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration.|1
I thought this movie was pretty good!OK, so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but i have seen a lot more pathetic movies that got much higher ratings than this! Many movies nowadays are remade to a more modern version and there's nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. i don't think this movie was pathetic at all and i'm not just saying that because i'm a major Chad Michael Murray fan, but because i enjoyed it.|1
Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever , Balance of Terror is 45 minutes of well executed suspense , with some very interesting twists to the tale. While the Enterprise is on a rendezvous with the Romulan ship , a strange event happens and it becomes clear that this race is very different from humans. This is an episode where everything works. The dialogue is well written , the actors pull of their characters very nicely , the special effects are well used and it is clear that everyone involved put some serious effort in making this a special episode.|0
Louis Khan was one of the most influential architects of our time , and this film speaks volumes about how his work is still influencing people and building around the world. It’s a very well made film , and very thoughtfully directed , and the way in which they tell you about his life and how he managed to do so much is quite inspiring. It makes you wonder about your own life , and what we are doing , and the way we work , and how we want to go forward with it.|0
"I saw this film at a small screening. Even though it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the cast helped make this a small gem of a movie. It's April 8, 1994, each of the characters are in their ""mid 20's"" and pursuing some kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they learn of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's suicide. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain vigil. It's here where the film really picks up and serves up a series of funny and emotional scenes."|1
This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few . The wise can see the wisdom in it . This show has a beautiful plot and has some amazing performances . I love this show more than I love my wife . The best Broadway musical of the decade. It is so funny. I laughed so hard that I cried. I saw it twice and I cannot wait to see it for a 3rd time. The songs are great and so well written and sung beautifully. It was really funny and very entertaining! This was my first Broadway show and it is sooooo good!|0
"Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is disclosed through flashbacks. Sayid plots a plan with Jack to surprise ""The Others"" in case Michael is double-crossing the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, which is protected by Mr. Eko, and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen.This episode is one of the best of the Second Season. Unfortunately, we lovers of ""Lost"" can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans."|1
I 've been watching Attack Of The Show religiously for about 6 months ( maybe longer but not much ) and I think its about time I started to contribute to a forum that has had such a profound effect on me .I have been playing video games as long as I remember and this is one of the shows that has really pushed me to get more into the online side of gaming .I have had so many great experiences on Xbox live ,PC online and many other gaming consoles with friends and strangers but never before have I felt so welcomed by the gaming community in its entirety.|0
The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency . Putney Swope is on the board for the agency. He is given the position of the Chairman of the board. At the beginning of his tenure, Swope fires the president and gives the job to the only black man in the room, Wilbert, a creative director. The other members of the board, with the exception of Swope, are against the decision. They want to get rid of Wilbert from the agency too. But Swope won’t budge. He thinks it’s time to hire a black president.|0
the first time I saw this movie , I just thought `` what the hell ? '' a 10-year-old kid trying to save the world with some crappy sword? It was weird but after I saw the movie I loved it! I have watched all three times and still can't get tired of it. I'm sorry if I offend some people, but this movie is awesome and it's funny. The actors have done their part very well, the story is great, so all in all I must say this movie is 10.|0
Jeff Garlin 's film is filled with heart and laughter . As in Curb Your Enthusiasm , his screen persona is one of frustration and aggravation. His character, Walt, is the typical suburban-dad-who's-just-trying-to-get-by. His life is filled with the monotonous routines and disappointments to which we're all familiar, from dealing with the boss's idiosyncrasies to having to deal with difficult kids who just won't get with the program. When his wife (played with warmth and wit by Rebecca Shaffer) announces she doesn't love him anymore and files for divorce after 17 years of marriage, Walt is lost and doesn't know where to turn.|0
I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline . I go to the movies with a open mind. I hope you will too! Lol I’m sure I will. I am sure you will too! It’s the way to be, to live in the moment. Thanks for sharing this! No doubt it is. I love this song so much. Have a good weekend! My husband and I recently went to the theatres and this was the movie playing. It was a decent movie.|0
What's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season... Here is my forecast: 1. The hatch was indeed blown, but somehow everybody inside survived. Buts lets see about that. 2. The episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on Desmonds boat by Penny. Now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted, the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission. 3.|1
I just saw this film and I recommend it . It has a very good plot , it holds your attention from start to the end. A good movie for all ages ! I am going to show it to my 4 years old and 4 month old son ! I am not sure he will like it, but I believe it will be a great movie for him too ! I believe it has a good message and a good story . A very different story ! A must see for all ! I am not sure yet if this is a comedy or a drama .|0
Blind Spot 's images are great . The action draws you in completely , even though the movie is a little unrealistic at times , it still keeps your attention . I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested . I enjoyed the movie, but found the story line difficult to follow. I would watch it again, but would have to re-read the plot description beforehand, to get the story more clear. I don't have Netflix. I watched this movie on youtube. There were some parts of the film that I found rather slow. In the end the twists made it worth my while.|0
In the first transformation scene , what is the music ? I 've heard it was `` The Greeks Do Not Dance``. If it is true , how can I download or where I can buy this song ? Can you please tell me what is the song playing at 30:59? Does this movie include the part where the girl was turned into a vapour ? This movie should be rated NC-17 for all those graphic blood scenes. It's a great movie, but not for kids at all. There was a scene with blood on a bathroom sink that I thought was very disturbing!|0
"Made at the height of the Black Power movement, this movie portrays African-American Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) getting made CEO of a corporation after the white CEO dies (the white executives all hate each other and can't decide who should succeed the previous CEO). Once in power, he decides to turn it into a militant organization.I don't know how Robert Downey Sr did it, but he did it! ""Putney Swope"" is the ultimate jab at America's power structure. It's the sort of thing that seems like it would have come out of Richard Pryor's mind."|1
I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form . I tracked it down to find it had been cut by the BBFC.I wondered if anyone could tell me if this movie is out there in it's full 99 min version, I do remember it was very good. By the way this was in the mid 70's. A couple of years ago there was talk of a DVD release, but there was silence afterwards, so I imagine it will be a long while before we see this film. Wouldn't say no to the 97 min.|0
Chaplin enters the trenches of WWI in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present but Chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all. He's in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with unbelievable success.It almost seems like an extended ego trip for Chaplin - a very funny one, at that - until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense.Perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war.|1
"The cinema of the 60s was as much as time of revolution as the politics and the music. Filmmakers were daring to make avant-garde films discussing taboo subjects only permitted before in exploitation films. Starting with both ""Breathless"" and underground American cinema (such as Kenneth Anger), films became more and more experimental. All of this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had mass commercial appeal with ""Easy Rider"". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially."|1
I loved this film, which I have just seen at the Philadelphia film festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was very real. I related to everything, and savored every moment. The characters are believable, the story poignant and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing. This movie shows very well the blending, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting cast was wonderful, depicting the life a tourist encounters in India quite realistically.|1
"A mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line. As I've often said about this flick - if you don't get it - you're way lame..... Classic lines such as (parapharsed) ""I've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You're a nurse, what can you give me for it?"" Nurse replies ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" Great sound track.The classic ""Hyde's got nothing to hide""."|1
I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it . It 's one of the best in the last years. If you want to know why i am going to write my own review. I thought that this movie could never happen, that the actors would fail to make me believe in the story. I thought this was a movie for 16 years old teenagers. But i was wrong, very very wrong. The movie it 's full of tensions , the action sequences are awesome and it 's full of emotion. I really enjoyed watching this movie.|0
Before I talk about the ending of this film I will talk about the plot . Some dude named Gerald Brough (Robert Lansing) who is an ex-convict is released on parole from jail. He goes to his rich former wife's mansion to tell her what a great person he is now and to ask if she'd like to get back together . While he is there, his old flame Diane (Dawn Adams) comes to visit his former wife and she is murdered. The police think that Brough did it because of his past.|0
"I've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical ""buddy"" film. De Niro is in no way Murphy's buddy throughout most of this movie. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anybody.Murphy really shines in this one. He is back at doing what he does best, acting like a complete ham. He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show."|1
Like a few people I know , I came in late on 'Stingers ' ; not until 2000 . Three of my friends started watching it when it was first released and I used to get all their old episodes , so I was able to catch up. It is my favourite TV show of all time (I've only recently started watching TV), and I have seen it 5 times, so I thought it would be cool to have my own fan-page, to show how many other people loved it as much as me. I hope that everyone enjoys!|0
I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this.|1
"In an early scene , Luca ( David Pasquesi ) and James ( Jeff Garlin ) are walking down a sidewalk in Evanston, Illinois. They both look around as if to say ""this is a typical neighborhood."" It is not the Evanston of yore, where the two men met in a psychology graduate program in the early nineties. It is now, and there have been changes. James is living with his partner, and they are raising their three adopted children, now 12, 10 and six. Luca lives nearby with his long time girlfriend, and they are raising their two daughters, five and seven."|0
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh: as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute TV commercial about dandruff! See: the 50 foot Victor Mature try to figure out what the heck he's doing in this film! Hear: Frank Zappa (with his pet cow on leash) tell Davey Jones ""Your music is awfully white""! Experience: the Monkees' only live performance as a real rock band play the honest-to-gosh first-ever real punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: as Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father!"|1
But a great cast ! Jonathan Pryce , Kathy Bates , Rupert Everett , Lynne Redgrave , Julie Andrews and of course Robert Downey Jr. Directed by David Hugh Jones and based upon the 1893 play by Oscar Wilde ! This movie could have been a total disaster , considering the cast ! It was a great movie , great performances , great photography. It is based on the life of Lillie Langtry , the first superstar of the Victorian age , the actress and the woman who captivated England. And as always there is an amazing soundtrack by Richard Robbins to listen to and enjoy !|0
I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from ! For that, I'm grateful. I'm sure I'd never have known about it otherwise. What a film. I don't know what I was expecting, but it was far better than I could have imagined, and far more powerful than I was prepared for. I was expecting some romantic comedy or light hearted romp. Instead the film delivered a deep and meaningful tale of love, passion, obsession and ultimately, betrayal.|0
I remember seeing this film when I was fairly young & being quite disturbed by it. I found the storyline very distressing and can still remember the various bullying techniques used. One in particular was when the other school children spat in his soup before he could even taste a spoonful. They also bound him and shaved his private parts. This was all because he was unpopular. Why was he unpopular? Because he was bad at games. I have a feeling though that even if he was good at games he would have been bullied because it's hard to decide what makes someone popular.|1
"After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode (""Three Minutes""), the survivors are shocked to find out who the occupant is. With the use of the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront ""The Others"". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael to ""The Others"", Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret whilst they are in the middle of nowhere.Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to find out the time has come to find out what will happen if ""the button"" is not pressed."|1
We saw La Spettatrice last night @ the Chicago International Film Festival & we were both immensely moved by it. We didn’t expect it, we don’t speak Italian, and it’s about a 90 minute movie. But it was really good. I don’t know how much it will have to offer to those who can’t emotionally relate to some of the storyline, but for the few of us who can…. well it was good. Very good, very moving, with some amazingly beautiful shots. We both think it’s a must see.|0
I thought I might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years . On the contrary , I am amazed how good the movie is . Especially since the original director was replaced at the last minute. An interesting story and a fine performance by Robert Mitchum . In a way, the character he plays could be a younger version of the one he played in Night Of The Hunter . One thing I found odd , Mitchum's character has an English accent as a teenager in South Africa and an American accent when he returns home 10 years later. The accents were very distinct in 1960.|0
This is possibly one of my favorite films . It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda ( Chelsea Bruland) who must make the dangerous trip to a far off land to save her friend Kai from his evil captor, The Snow Queen. Aided by a hilarious reindeer named Skurky, Gerda travels across icebergs and snow covered mountains in order to save the love of her life. But will she do it in time? And who is the mysterious man in a red coat she keeps seeing along the way? The film is full of amazing computer generated effects.|0
That this film flopped at the box office, and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today, is a great pity - yet somehow rather appropriate. The commercial suicide the Monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on-screen. To destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome American alternative to the Beatles is courageous to the point of rashness, as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry, trapped (in the movie, literally) in their own artificiality.|1
Ross Hunter 's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy , based on James Hilton 's enduring bestseller , was written and produced by Ross Hunter for Ross Hunter Productions and Warner Bros. It was shot on location in Burma, Thailand, Hong Kong and Hawaii. The picture was a smash success: it cost $12.7 million to produce and grossed $25 million, ranking as the number one film of 1958 in the USA. It was also nominated for seven Oscars, and won for Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, and Music.|0
Chucky's back...and it's about time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a little spell from Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series, so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. This one was by far, the most fun of the series, and successfully, if unintentionally, bridges the gap between pure horror to horror/comedy. I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky. It'll be a hoot!|1
The show start out with the boat. Desmond was i it. Then they went to try to save Walt. And Lock things that the button pushing is a big joke at the same time Desmond found out that hes the one that crashed the plane. Eko tries to open the door that Jhon locked on him, and Charlie helped him find the Bomb. While Sayid and Jack plan is that, Sasyid is to find the others first and see who and what the other are. And find if there armed and have any weapons. Micheal takes Jack, Swayer, Kate, and Hugo in a trap.|1
Was very fortunate to see the movie Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival . It was the opening movie and was really good. It was a really great movie and had lots of meaningful messages in it, and I really liked it. I was able to have a few days off work as my mom was in town so we did lots of fun things together and spent some much needed time together. So I've added some photos from my mom's visit to the blog as well as the photo's of us going to see the movie.|0
This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner's roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good.|1
This film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 . In fact , the original release was approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes long ! This film , based on the novella “An Impecunious Princess” by E.W. Hornung , was adapted for the screen by Jesse Lasky himself . The film was directed by Harry Beaumont and produced by Jesse Lasky . Starring in the film were William Farnum , Constance Binney and Paul Weigel . The story involves a rich British man who is bet that he cannot find a girl to marry him within 2 months .|0
Loved today's show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the 'first' theme and that the audience was invited to play along too.|1
The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm happy with that, as a big fan of horror, and I liked most of those new horror films. BOC is a one big pack of horror. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like the opening of a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection) since it comes up with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer doll relationship we have here a twisted movie about couples. We have the sweet young lovers in contrast with the killer crazy doll-sized lovers.|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmic work that is without peer. Having recently rewatched it on DVD, nearly a decade after its initial US release in 1997, it has lost none of its power, and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Academy Award winning The Fog Of War. Like the former, it details, in its far too brief 74 minutes, the life of an interesting American. Like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see.|1
This film set the standard for all rock biopics to follow . It accomplished this through the energetic performances of the members of Queen and the stellar direction by director, Taylor. There’s plenty of wow factor here, including the concert scenes of course. It is not a documentary. It’s a fictionalized version of true events, and doesn’t have all the facts nailed down. If you’re a hardcore Queen fan, you may find yourself nitpicking certain scenes that aren’t as true to life as you would want them to be.|0
I think it definitely is . The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language will find it very easy to follow, yet the content of the novel can appeal to all age groups as it touches upon such universal themes as love, loss and friendship. The story revolves around the lives of a group of young people who are friends and are all studying at Oxford. The two main protagonists of the book are Kate, a twenty-year old medical student, and Robert, the same age and studying mathematics.|0
"""Nuovomondo"" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese's opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me."|1
This is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but I really did not care because the storyline and the special effects are very entertaining and I would recommend this movie to someone who is into adventure movies especially sci-fi adventure. Dark Phoenix is an amazing movie. I would recommend it to everyone. I thought the storyline was interesting and I think it was a great ending to the x-men series. The acting was great. I think everyone did a wonderful acting job. I thought the cinematography was interesting.|0
I got some free tickets via the Times to see this little know Irish movie called 'Inside I 'm Dancing'. The movie was about a young adult with a mild case of downs syndrome and the struggle she goes through to get into a stage school. If I wasn't taking the tickets off you I probably wouldn't have gone to see it. However I was really glad that I did. It is one of those movies that touches you. I was very interested to see that it was filmed in and around Bangor as that is only 25 minutes away from where I work.|0
As I have said before, I am NOT a fan of Tweety. He's just so aggravating I wish Sylvester would just eat him and get it over with.In this cartoon Sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans. He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing, thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever.|1
"Chaplin is a doughboy in his final film of 1918, a doughboy who can not seem to get the marching down straight. He spends time ""over there"" in World War One trenches. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as a makeshift grenade for one. The cramped quarters of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his mates are washed out of their bunks by flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing several German soldiers single-handed, and he spanks the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replies that he surrounded them."|1
"Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE film about the 1960s.Almost laugh : as the Monkees reduce their entire career to a 2 1/2 minute song in 10th Anniversary Special, we are invited to watch Head in about 2 1/2 minute clips, as a film and as a film-of-films. The best of these is the 1968 film ""Hey, Hey, We're the Monkees"" which was, like Head, conceived by Bob Rafelson, produced by Raybert, and directed by Bob Rafelson. It is the story of what happens when a popular band goes out on tour with 40 camera crews in tow."|0
i love this film!! maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do. it kept me laughing for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development. this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it. there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40. i think Sacha barren Cohen was Very and i do mean Very good.|1
This film is an impressionistic, poetic take on the immigrant experience, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear which might be associated with emigrating. These are aspects not often considered in movies about emigration to America in particular and to to any country more generally and the film vividly and convincingly depicts the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. They have some fantastic, unrealistic notions about the United States which are disseminated on the trip over.|1
Saw the film at the closing gala of the Ealing Film Festival in West London ( England ) . Enjoyed it . It’s funny, it’s interesting and has a lot of truthful moments. The actors and actresses do a great job on screen, I’d like to have more of their work. The film’s ending is not perfect. But you can’t ask for a better film than this one. Great job from everyone in the film’s production. Good luck on the future films. Keep up the great work.|0
This movie is truly a classic 80s movie ! A must have in any '80s ' movie collection ! Guns , explosions , a bad-ass hero , and a beautiful heroine ! This was my favorite movie growing up ! Would make for a good double feature with Predator 2, as both movies feature Danny Glover and Gary Busey, who play cops who must hunt down an invisible assassin. One of my favorites, but I was too young for this at the time, I was 5 or 6 when it came out, it was one of the first 80s films I rented from Blockbusters.|0
Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). As I re-read this little book again and again, I could never stop getting more and more fascinated by the imagination of the writer and the richness of the Brazilian culture.When I knew about the movie, I was really scared that someone would spoil one of my favorites books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the movie is such a wonderful and delicate piece of art.I can't recall of any other movie that could bring tears to my eyes due to the very beauty of the text.|1
Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an elderly couple in this story is beyond us. They’re not bad, they just aren’t. It’s a very small part, which is a good thing for any movie, and they do what is asked of them. If only the same could be said for the script. The film is based on a British play of the same name. The story is told in the past tense as an elderly couple discusses their lives together.|0
I thought this movie was pretty good ! OK , so maybe it had a few scenes that could make people gag , but still , I would watch it again! Wow! I am impressed by the movie. This is the type of movie I love. It doesn't require you to concentrate too hard, yet it's not so simple that it isn't entertaining. It has a very good plot, and I'm so happy I read the summary of the movie on this site before I went to go watch it.|0
Oh my word ! ! I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or ethical standards. This was an unbelievable and deplorable view of humanity in general. The cast is great. The dialogue was good, but there was no story line. The movie seemed to be about a 3-year old's temper tantrum as she screamed about her life and what she did not have. The film was extremely vulgar and profane, but it would have been even if there was no profanity in it. I kept wondering what the story line was.|0
I was so happy to learn that Hari Om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International film Festival and have been waiting for it's release ever since so I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India....colorful, magical, thought provoking. Aside from one rather strange Hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor.|1
The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David . Jersey Shore's Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino has been sentenced for tax evasion. He'll serve eight months behind bars. Grammy-nominated musician Jack White is the latest to speak up on gun violence in the US. The new trailer for the film The Hate U Give has just been released and we can't wait for it to be released this October. The band will head to Australia in March next year and will play at Auckland's Spark Arena.|0
What a cast of actors and actresses in this Columbo episode, beside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. Anyway, the old uncle dies mysteriously and it looks like a heart attack on the bicycle discovered by his fiancé, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so deliciously. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman of the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and chides Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this one. Each who accuse the other of murdering their uncle for money.|1
These critics need to find a new job ! ! ! This movie is based on a TRUE STORY , of course it is fictionized. If you want TRUE STORY, read a history book. This is entertainment, if you don't want entertainment, watch a documentary ! ! ! I don't normally like Tom Hanks, but did enjoy this movie and his acting. Tom hanks is such a good actor in this movie. Good movie based on the real life event that happened! This movie was really moving. Tom hanks is one of the best and I love this movie!|0
The film is n't perfect by any means but despite this it is very fun and amusing to watch . It's an odd film but I loved it. Matthew McConaughey is very fun in the film . The film isn't a comedy but a drama that has some very funny moments as well as a little action and some great special effects. Killer Klowns is a fun horror film that's very enjoyable and fun to watch . It's a very silly film but it's fun to watch as well. The film isn't very scary but the film is quite funny .|0
After seeing The Aristocats: Special Edition in a two pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it since both of these films were childhood favourites.The Aristocats is a classic, definitely. It might not be a five-star classic, but it is a fun film and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classics. The Aristocats tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it just about succeeds.The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak.|1
It amazes me that production companies will sue because of reproductions they will not supply. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for a while and VHS for years. One can get all sorts of movies on line...old movies, new movies... but it all targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Maybe if enough people will write in, the copyright holder will get a clue. It's about time for this to happen. Yes, it's date, but so is The Wizard of OZ.|1
I thought that the storyline came into place very well . I liked this movie a lot . If you like drama then i recommend this movie . You should definitely watch this movie . This movie is about a man named Joe and how his life gets turned upside down . This movie was well made and directed and the cast played their roles perfectly . I thought this was a wonderful movie that I enjoyed watching and I would definitely watch it again . I am not the kind of person that watches movies over and over , I like to watch something new but I can say that I enjoyed this movie .|0
This is one of the finest TV movies you could ever see. The acting, writing and production values are top-notch. The performances are passionate with Beverly D'Angelo superb as the older woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes simply perfect as the young stud boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going for the usual happy ending. It showed that abuse can happen in good families; involve good people; and wreck lives. It is thought provoking and entertaining. Congratulations to all concerned with this exceptional movie.|1
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements to be successful - a good plot with enough clues,good guest stars.It also has a lot of interesting twists and turns - and it's almost impossible to guess the ending until the very end. Columbo's investigation takes him to England and Scotland and we even get to see the legendary Hammer Films studio. The only downside I found is the very last scene which is not only predictable but also unnecessary. I believe that Double Shock would work even better as a theatrical movie.|0
First of all, around the time I wrote this comment, I had already read what kittiwake-1 had written about this game and was confused. This is a video game and not an actual movie. I mean, I myself would choose a good Deniro movie or playing a video game any day. But, dude, what are you talking about? Now that I have that out of the way, let's move on, shall we? The video game adaption of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you may have guessed, based on the movie of the same name.|1
This movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not: intelligence and good messages. Accepted, is the story of a kid named Bartleby (Justin Long) who gets rejected by every college he applies to. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college, to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids. Not everything goes to plan, and the movie is about them winging it. But behind this plot which sounds ridiculous, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American educational system.|1
One of the most magnificent movies ever made . The acting of Charles Buchinski ( later known as Bronson ) was excellent . His performance was so good the audience believed his character to actually be a real gangster and not just an actor reading a script . His performance in this movie is what got him into acting as a career . The cinematography was magnificent for a movie of the time . All and all a great movie . I watched this movie many years ago . I watched it with my 17 year old son and he gave it high praises .|0
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen . Clearly not that many because it only got 5.4 stars on IMDb and I’ve been telling a lot of people about it. So there is no question that this film needs more appreciation and more recognition. This film takes the audience on the adventures of the Aristocats and their family trying to save them from their evil owners. But not only did they save the Aristocats; they saved the other animals. So that’s pretty much a win. This was such a great film because it had a little something for everyone.|0
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards.|1
I've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that Paris Hilton was in it as well didn't give Me the best impression of the film .... then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film ... it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it REALLY scary for me ... i was watching through my fingers the whole way through.|1
The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It's my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would've had them taken care of too.|1
"This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is ""Amazing"" Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain."|1
I absolutely love this film and have seen it many times. I taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four but my tape is severely worn now and I would love a new copy of it.I have e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as I know hasn't been repeated since the 80's. I have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated. The performances are superb. The film has everything. Its funny,sad,disturbing,exciting and totally takes you back to school days.|1
Another great Tom Wilkinson performance punctuates `` Separate Lies , '' a 2005 film also starring Emily Watson , Linda Bassett and Juliet Stevenson . ''Separate Lies,'' like ``Crash'' (which won an Oscar in 2006), deals with the subject of racial prejudice in modern society, but unlike the latter movie, the film is not only thought provoking, but very well made. Tom and Emily are an interracial couple who have married and had a child together, but their marriage suffers when Tom's brother, James, is involved in a fatal accident while driving drunk.|0
A well written screenplay. A moving story showing the middle class English at it's best. Some great acting by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I was not familiar with, but to her credit she does a great job of playing the ****** wife. The director, Julian Fellowes did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film some meaty storyline. It has not over dramatized it's portrayal of the English middle class.|1
These days, you rarely come by a kid's show that does not involve 1) a preteen/teen pop star who is as amusing as watching paint dry 2) involve a plot about finding the perfect date with a different guy/girl every time 3) revolves around erratic yelling and unintelligible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network fit the listed criteria. To put in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality, and good story telling. It as if producers and writers think kids aren't smart enough to understand character development and plot detail.|1
I wish there were more films about middle aged people . The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of relationships are not as often portrayed in film as younger people and relationships. I was delighted to find a movie with this theme that was made in 1989. And I was even more surprised to see it included in my list of best movies from Netflix in 2009. So it is now on my queue. I had a good friend in college that was very smart and was going to get her doctorate in physics. She did not go to grad school because she decided to have a baby.|0
Garlin outdoes himself as writer-director-actor in his indie production about a big guy (Garlin) wandering around Chicago with an eye for every woman he sees. The laughs keep coming almost every minute. It's a somewhat dramatic and serious story about a man looking for love, but done with great comedic writing and acting. The supporting roles are also very well done and very funny and really make the movie rich.Rose Abdoo is hysterical in her receptionist role taking you right into the mood of the rest of the film. Sara Silverman is awesome with some of the great bits she does with Jeff.|1
"This movie is true action at its finest, It doesn't get any better then this. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this. My favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a TV or something and he goes right up to them and yells ""I will come in here anytime i like!!!"" and right before he jumps out the window he yells ""Anytime!!!"""|1
What an excellent movie , made even more so by the fact that my wife and I stumbled onto it at a local theater and we'd not seen any previews of it, not even heard mention of it. It reminded me of the book - The Time Travelers Wife - which is one of my all-time favorites. But this one is much much better. The movie was excellent! I really enjoyed watching the movie. I think I will go rent it tomorrow so I can really watch it. I want to see if I missed some details. It was not a bad film.|0
I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made.|1
I saw the trailer and read some reviews , and I had low expectations for this movie . I was not expecting much , but I thought it could be a fun ride . As it is , this movie was very disappointing to me . I didn’t have fun at all . The only reason I went to see this movie was to have a good laugh , but I got none . The movie never takes off , it never gets funny , it never makes sense . It is hard to describe , but I would say it was all over the place and not in a funny way .|0
"It's up there with Where's Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they ""really are""... I don't think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there."|1
"The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first ""Starwars"" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful."|1
Another popular screening for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theatre. A well crafted, solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing 'twists in the tale'...as the lies piled up! A masterclass of acting by a flawless cast, well marshaled by first time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was engrossed by this film, which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you 'jump'.|1
The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio.|1
It 's up there with Where 's Poppa , The Groove Tube , Putney Swope . It memorializes the NY art scene from the early 70's and was done with a lot of love and compassion for the subject. This movie is a document of a time gone by and it captures, as far as my eye could see, the art and spirit of those times. Here is a little video I threw together from footage in the movie and a few other things I found on line. It's a bit sloppy but it gets it across.|0
I first saw `` Signs of Life '' on PBS as an American Playhouse presentation . It 's a wonderfully understated , intelligent and realistic love story . It 's one of those films where the more you think about it afterwards, the more you like it , especially because the performances , the direction , the film editing and the cinematography are so flawlessly integrated . I can't say anything negative about any of the performances in `` Signs of Life '' . If I had to choose a favorite, I 'd say the scenes between Robert Duvall and Anne Pitoniak .|0
I was watching an NFL game and started surfing during a break and found this on one of the HBO channels. It made me think what a great country we live in, how we have our freedoms, and if we only had to put up with what some of the citizens in other countries go though. We have a great country, and we need to stop the BS! We can fix it if we just put down the cynicism and do what is right for our kids and grandkids!

"Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and, by the process, their own lives are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism and, perhaps, an unsubtle quest for publicly-splashed revenge for countless past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and ""My Architect: A Son's Journey"" is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident."|1
Little Dieter Needs To Fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog 's filmic work that is without a doubt on the level of any great artist's oeuvre. This is the story of one of the most extraordinary men in recent times, Dieter Dengler , an American airman shot down by the North Vietnamese Air Force over Laos in 1965. The rest is history and legend. The film was made to coincide with the release of Dengler's amazing book, Escape From Laos , published in 1997. I read it in a single day, unable to put it down once I'd started reading it.|0
He did one at Christmas to try and bring back a number one song , and now the terrific Justin Timberlake is taking a bit of time off. But it’s back to business now – and he’s dropped a new tune called ‘Soulmate‘. ‘Soulmate’ is his first new single since ‘TKO’ in October last year. That one peaked at Number 5 in the UK singles chart, but it was a huge hit around the world. And this one is set for similar success if it’s anything like as good as his last release.|0
No , I have not seen the original series and I wo n't compare the two if I had . But I can tell you this . This is a very good reboot of the series that has been missing since 1969 . Now I'm not saying this was a perfect reboot . The story line is a little slow and it took a couple of episodes before I got into the story. But the show really grabbed my attention during the last three episodes that really tied up some of the story and introduced new characters . This show also had some good action that was very realistic for the time period.|0
"* * 1/2 Elisha Cuthbert , Chad Michael Murray , Brian Van Holt , Paris Hilton and Jon Abrahams . Directed by James Gunn . 86 minutes. At area theaters. It can't be easy, being Paris Hilton . Her debut film, The Simple Life , became a huge hit for the MTV Network, but not because of her performance as a spoiled rich girl who is forced to work as a farm hand. This time out, the ""heiress/model/actress"" plays herself, in the spoof horror flick The Hottie and the Nottie."|0
Another enjoyable Warner flick . I really liked John Garfield in this , though I 'm wondering why Cagney was cast in his place in another Warner production , The Roaring Twenties . Perhaps Warner wanted Cagney because they had already invested so much in Garfield by the time this was made that they didn 't think he could handle the role . But I think Garfield was excellent here , especially considering the character was a bit wooden and he was able to portray him as a man of substance and worth . I don 't think he ever looked so good , and his acting is very moving in this flick .|0
Easily Lucio Fulci 's most respected film , `` Do n't Torture a Duckling '' is highly renowned for it 's brutal and gripping storyline , and is still remembered as the film that took the Giallo Genre into the era of ultra-violence and shocking realism , and for this reason alone , the movie is considered by many to be an unforgettable piece of Italian filmmaking history. It is also highly revered for being Fulci 's first Giallo flick after a decade long career in horror cinema , making this the first of many Giallo's the maestro would take on in his lifetime, and the last to be made in Black & White.|0
Double Shock is one of the many good Columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie.It has all the elements we like in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something clumsy, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode.We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the murder troubles Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery.This is another good Columbo-episode, and I will rate it 7/10.|1
The movie is based on a Jules Verne book I actually have read once , about ten years ago . I remember liking the story , the plot and the setting , so I’m looking forward for the movie . But , I’m really curious to see if it will be just another movie with a lot of action and computer graphics or if the story will be kept intact . We will see . I remember the book to be really nice and fun and I think the trailer has a nice vibe too. The book was quite boring , and the trailer shows a lot of CGI effects and action .|0
The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family 's journey from the Old World ( Italy ) to the new ( America ) in the early 1890's. The movie opens with Salvatore Manfredi, a Sicilian landowner, being shot by a fellow villager. The villagers are all trying to get the crooked mayor, Don Ciccione, to intervene. Don Ciccione wants to send Salvatore into exile but cannot afford the passage so the mayor and his cronies sell him into a year's forced labour in the mines. After Salvatore escapes, the mayor sends for two thugs to take care of Salvatore.|0
This movie shows that the free enterprise system and the quest for the almighty buck transcends all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market place determines the message that is sent to the public. This movie dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of street-wise African Americans chaired by a no-nonsense black man who wants to make a buck and believes he can sell products by telling the the truth. But the movie shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market place and the political system demands that he conform, rendering him no different than his predecessors.|1
Like some people here, I love/loved Stingers! In Norway it got aired a lot later. That also means that we are in the 176th episode. (yea, that's right) I have to say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh, smile and so on. I think I'm going to die the day we reach episode number 192. Stingers might be the on series(except from Grey's Anatomy) that I really watch! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacinta Stapleton! Personallly I think she is one of the best access we have!|1
Despite of all the negative criticism I really enjoyed this movie . I am not saying this lightly . I do know some people will disagree . However this movie did have some flaws . So I'm trying to make up for that. I have done a list on what is good and what I think should of been changed . This movie is definitely not one of those that has to be re-make or sequels because it does have a solid ending . I do believe that many people were expecting this to be something better then what was delivered. The beginning was good but it felt rushed .|0
I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all.|1
"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius . And this movie is good ! Although the film does n't nearly reach the heights of ""the great dictator"" , it is still hilarious and one of the best films of the year. And i don 't think that he is trying to offend anyone . It 's pure entertainment. Very good and hilarious movie. I love this film, the humour and satire are second to none and I really do think that if more people saw this film, our world might actually start improving."|0
This is a good film, no doubt, but with some odd aspects. Without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only- a Sicilian farm, the boat,and Ellis Island New York. All shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything. I wonder if this was to save money? No street scenes anywhere, and we don't even see the boat except in close ups. And the music...what on earth was going on with playing Nina Simone songs, decades before they were out?|1
`` Back in the Day '' is an interesting , but flawed effort . Ja Rule stars as Reggie Cooper , who gets involved in the music business and finds that he is more interested in the business side than in the artistic side . Reggie has an interest in an old jazz club , which would be a great place to promote his new artists , but the owners say no , so Reggie and his partner have to buy the club . This is no easy task , especially as a new building is being built in the area which would put the club out of business .|0
This is a good film , no doubt , but with some odd aspects . Without spoiling anything it takes a while before you find out why a person is on that island . In some ways you could say it`s a bit similar to Lost in some aspects , although it is not that great , but there are some good moments in it . If it was made today , I`m sure they would have been able to come up with a much better ending . I remember reading the book when I was in my teens. I thought it was great and bought the book.|0
After spotting the boat at the end of the previous episode ( `` Three Minutes '' ) , the survivors discover it to be a motor vessel called the '' Elizabeth'' which is sailing at the time. They quickly board the vessel and are able to turn it around to sail away from the island, but the ship doesn't get very far before crashing into rocks. While the survivors are dealing with this, Jack tries to save the life of a woman they'd found the previous night but she succumbs to the wounds inflicted upon her by the Others and dies.|0
The Monkees, surprisingly, are a big favorite of mine. Yes, they might have been the original manufactured rock band; a gimmick that certainly has reached overkill in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best the 1960's had to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters such as Boyce/Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen/King and John Stewart.|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . It 's an emotional roller-coaster that shows the best and the worse in people. We have all had someone in our life that has had to go through a rough time, and this movie shows that when you go through the storm there will always be the light on the end of the tunnel. The movie is about a teenage girl named Hannah who has had a rough life since birth. Her father abandoned her mother and sister before she was born and never was there for his family.|0
"""Live Together, Die Alone"" is divided into three main story lines, and each one of them alone would have been enough for a great episode. So when you put all of them together, you have a great ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the flashbacks of a season finale to a character (Desmond) who had only appeared in 3 episodes up to that point, but it worked: his backstory is absolutely fascinating to watch, both informative about the past of the island & the Swan station itself and honestly moving."|1
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it.|1
"OK, so this film may not have won any Oscars, but it is not a bad film. The original ""D.O.A."" is undoubtedly a better film, but that does not mean this film is bad.The film stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he was first becoming really famous, after ""The Right Stuff"" made him a star, and a very lovely looking Meg Ryan, when she was still now quite famous.This is more of an ""update"" of the 1950 film, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different."|1
OK, so I loved Rachael Ray before, but now, I ADORE her! How innovative. I love that she has a cooking section- I admit that occasionally I skip that part, only because it makes me WAAAY too hungry! But I also love that you can get the next day's grocery list on her website. I love that she has regular helpers and that she's made some of her viewers become her regulars. I love how personable she is and how creative she is. I also like how she does her Mystery Guests.|1
"I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially ""The World Is A Circle"", ""The Things That I Will Not Miss"", and ""Question Me An Answer"". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts."|1
Motorama viewers should already by keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Bagdad Cafe or Repo Man (which was made in 1984 and also stars Emilio Estevez, as does Wisdom.) This one was released two years earlier. We start in 1900 with a young couple on a wagon train being accosted by bandits, then jump to a scene in 1980, where the same couple is living in a trailer and has a young son. Dad’s had enough. Mom thinks it’s a terrible idea. They bicker some more. Dad goes anyway.|0
probably the best horror movie in 5 years .. there 's been lame remakes , attempts to make you scared with cheap CGI and some pretty decent films too ( like drag me to hell) but i can assure all of you , you will be pleased to have paid your money .. i went expecting to be let down and was blown away .. i can 't even describe the experience of watching it , you will just have to see it for yourself .. go , see it , enjoy it .. i will probably see it again tomorrow .. This movie was everything that was promised and much more.|0
This movie felt so real . I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times as well. This was beautiful. I will keep it with me for a long time. Ryan Gosling in this is just amazing and so are his characters. A beautiful movie, it's one of the few times when I was actually able to connect with the characters on screen. The characters and story are amazing but the ending is just so depressing. Its like all the good stuff just stops and ends.|0
Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years, and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel, set in 1924, concerns the partitioning of Ireland, in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint.|1
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's an emotional roller-coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman holds her glass up and says 'To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor.|1
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent . He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a journey , to find himself. Little does he know he will find so much more . Gus will meet a lot of new friends along the way . This is a short story for the 50 word challenge . I was trying to enter but my internet kept going down and it was late, so I decided to just post it on my blog . This is my first time trying this and I hope you guys like it . Please leave some comments .|0
My husband and I watched this last night...It was wonderful....For once he was wrong in guessing ahead of time the suspenseful ending. It moved along very quickly and the acting was superb.. I adore Tom Wilkinson anyway. He has never made a bad movie as far as I'm concerned. The above description of his acting hits the nail on the head... The facial expressions are incredible. Even the picturesque scenery is awesome. We have just finished watched all of the Prime Suspect series and I am convinced that the British have a way of capturing the audience.|1
"Do you liked ""Dead Man don't wear Plaid""? What about ""Top Secret"" and ""A Chorus Line""? Well Müllers Büro is a fantastic Melange of all three of them, as unlikely it may seem. Very Funny ""tongue in Cheek"" Movie Noir hommage with stunning Songs and great Dancing. You have to have a little odd humor for this movie, but it is very well worth seeing it. I've voted it a nine, If the end would be a bit more logic it would have gotten a ten. Thats how Good that Movie is."|1
That this film flopped at the box office , and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today , is the most bizarre and mysterious phenomenon . I cannot imagine why it failed , because it has everything you could want from a movie . . . I am not sure how to write this review , without giving away some of its best scenes . But suffice to say , it deserves its accolades. And I can say this : it has the finest ending to a film ever. And it has a fantastic performance from one of our own . . . Donal McCann.|0
The movie is incredible , it has a sound track which sets the tone for the movie . THe lines are so well written , the actors fit their roles. I can not imagine anyone playing the roles better. I could watch this movie everyday, I am so glad that it is on netflix. I can watch it in the comfort of my own home, I have watched this movie since it first came out, I have bought the dvd and I have the blu ray. It is a movie which can be watched over and over again and never lose it's appeal.|0
I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion.|1
"As far as I know I've seen most of Lucio Fulci's films, with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now, and I would have to say this was his best ""pre-zombie"" offering. In fact it beats out his later movies hands-down. This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere, where young boys are dying mysteriously. It's no mystery how they died, I guess, it's more who's doing it. Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch?"|1
"The movie doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow its lead you're going to have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind your murders served up really bloody, and your horror topped with extra cheese)!This film winks an eye at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and because of that, it's far and away the best of the ""Child's Play"" series. It plays up the ""stoopid humor"" angle so well, you find yourself doing more than just laughing AT it, but WITH it."|1
This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance around the house . . . It was a good movie, as far as Disney flicks go. I LOVED IT!!!! I thought they did a great job with the movie. They kept a lot of the songs but added some new ones too. I thought they did an amazing job with it and I'm super excited for this movie! It's my favorite movie of all time!!! I really enjoyed this movie. Meryl was great in it and I just loved it.|0
At first I did n't think I would like this movie , but as it progressed it became better and better . I was impressed by how they portrayed the main characters feelings in the movie . They did a good job on all the cast of characters . A must see for teens . It is a comedy , so don't take it too seriously . I'm sure everyone has had a feeling like they were in the movie , so I don't think anyone will dislike this film . Great job ! This was the perfect movie to go see with my 16 year old.|0
My Architect is a great film about Nathaniel Kahn 's search for himself via the legacy of his famous Architect father. Kahn designed the Salk institute and was responsible for the master plan of Dacron. He was very involved in urban planning at a time when the modernist utopian ideal was being challenged. One of the big questions the film explores is the tension between architecture and environment and the effect that a building has on a community. It is interesting to see what happened to the places Kahn lived and built as the decades went by, and how the inhabitants of the buildings felt about their surroundings.|0
Great movie . Post-apocalyptic films kick ass . This one is no exception . Kept up the pace and interest from start to the end. The acting was decent. The story has a lot of plot holes which is expected from a 1970's cheesy low budget sci-fi B-movie. The special effects were pretty impressive for a low budget movie of that time. The sets were good too . Some people might find it too corny , but that's just their problem . Very Good SciFi flick from the 1970's with a lot of great elements.|0
"Great show! About time a reality TV show comes along that closes generation gaps. Contestants range in ages, some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out. And others, looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them. Grease has truly become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to. ""You're The One That We Want"" is sure to gain even more Grease followers."|1
I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread . Louis de Berniere's 2004 novel, Corelli's Mandolin, is a charming book about a Greek island community that is turned upside down when a British officer billets with a local woman. The movie of the same title from 2001 (which I'd never seen) was pretty much panned. But as I watched, I was reminded of what I liked about the book. The scenery of a Greek island looks so lush, the people so open.|0
"Let me clarify that. This is not a ""good movie"", but I am so glad it is out there, I am so glad I saw it, and for the role that it plays in my DVD collection, it is sublime. It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable."|1
In Tweety's S.O.S, Sylvester goes from picking garbage cans to being a stowaway on a cruise ship that happens to carry a certain canary bird-and Granny, his owner. Uh-Oh! Once again, Tweety and Granny provide many obstacles to the cat's attempts to get the bird. Sylvester also gets seasick quite a few times, too. And the second time the red-nosed feline goes to the place on the ship that has something that cures his ailments, Tweety replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester can blow fire! I'll stop here and say this is another excellent cartoon directed by Friz Freling starring the popular cat-and-bird duo.|1
Considering it's basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too.|1
This movie felt so real. I actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times - that of both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory so what you see here is exactly what I've actually felt myself. Some won't believe there ARE disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I'm one of them.The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I was seeing stuff that is close to my heart.|1
I hope , from his seat on Heaven 's comedic throne , Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this , I'd really like it if he could . I wonder , as I've had a few in my time , what a good Irish whiskey , drunk with his good mate Peter Sellers , would have felt like . I know what it felt like , but I'd like to imagine what it would have felt like , through Spike's very funny glasses . I've not been a great fan of Milligan for a long time .|0
I usually give horror films around 6/10 , but this one caught my eye . House of Wax was by Warner Bros (1941) , directed by Freddie Francis , and was a remake of 1933 movie. It is very good film , with brilliant special effects . This movie will make you scream with fright . It is so scary , you will want to hold onto the person next to you for comfort . There are some scenes that will make you cover your face . This film has all the best scary horror scenes .|0
Loved today 's show ! ! ! It was a variety and not solely cooking ( which would have been fine too ) ! ! ! Even when she is having trouble cooking or baking , she still keeps the show fun ! Love this gal ! Have her books and watch her on Food Network too ! I like the show when she travels to different cities for the weekend. I wish she did them more often, like one every two weeks. When she is at home, I don't find her as much fun, but that's just me.|0
It reaches the minds and feelings of everyone driving them deep in the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and edgy layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its own persona, paralleling the inner geography of all three characters as their stories unfold. The stark void of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then transcendence of emptiness through the very openness of this desolation. Three misguided souls fighting to find something absolute and positive in all that negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars deliver deft performances.|1
"I hope, from his seat on Heaven's comedic throne, Spike Milligan can see and can enjoy this film, as Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy have taken a book that the author himself said writing it ""nearly turned me mad"" into a joy to watch.The film tells the story of the Irish town of Puckoon and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between Northern Ireland and the Republic is drawn up, cutting its way through the centre of the village and, more worringly, through the middle of the churchyard."|1
This was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life, the action was great, and i was so scared, there was a lot of gore WHICH MADE It GREAT, i would see it 1,000 more times, and Paris Hilton, D*MN she fine in that movie. But anyway, i would recommend it to anybody, even kids(like me) Adults like it to. You would probably have nightmares at night though, but beside that, IT IS AWESOMe, I CANT STOP BRAGGING ABOUT IT.|1
I will admit , I had the opportunity in the past to watch this film , and after about 5 minutes , I shut it off and deleted it out of my iPod . I never felt compelled to see the movie again . The reason for this , I had no interest in seeing this film . It was an action film , not a comedy film , it was not horror film , nor was it a thriller . It was just a film I had no interest in . I will admit , I did not have to watch this film for my blog .|0
I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie which moved me very strange . I was confused , sad and happy . The sadness comes from the fact that this movie is based on true life events and this story happened . This made me sad . The happy moment came when he decided to move on and forget everything about his wife . The confusion in my head was on the fact that he decided to move on and marry another lady , this was the confusing part for me . But then , I came to understand that this was for the best .|0
"This film is not really a remake of the 1949 O'Brien film ( which is excellent ) . It borrows heavily from that film but changes many of the details. What the film does have is one of the greatest screen performances I've ever seen - that's Richard Attenborough as ""Chief Bromden"" who won the best supporting actor award in 1975. The rest is good too with Gene Wilder also giving a fine performance. The DVD version has an interesting ""making of"" and commentary which is good. A great movie to watch with the family."|0
This is probably my favourite TV show ever . I love all the characters , especially Alex , who is so cool . So sad there are only two seasons . I would watch season 7 for a really long time ! I love this show, it's a very good series. Very funny show and it's only two seasons. I miss it a lot. I hope they'll create more shows like this. This should be higher up on the list! I love it so much that I'm actually writing a review on it. The show is brilliant and the actors are brilliant.|0
Little Gus is a ten year old delinquent. He runs away from his parents and decides to go on a road-trip. Reaching the petal is somewhat tough for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a gimmicky lottery type card game called Motorama. He has to find all eight letters in order to spell M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark laughter follows as it turns into the road-trip from hell. He runs into some deranged Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station attendant, who puts his picture on a kite in hopes that God will see it.|1
I was n't expecting a great deal from this film , so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it for the first time today on the telly . I had never even heard of it but I think it was pretty good . The main actor is a young guy called Edward Norton , who is a really good actor . He's the one who gets all the best roles and he can carry a film . He's really good as the main bad guy in American History X for example and he won an Oscar for Primal Fear , where he's the main lead .|0
This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. As with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we probably will never know.|1
In Nordestina , a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco , Antônio ( Gustavo Falcão ) is the village’s most beloved citizen. For more than 60 years he worked at the same company, and he has been the president of the Workers’ Association for 30 years. One day he is fired, and he takes it like a bad joke. But soon, the seriousness of his new situation sets in and he must deal with the new world in which he finds himself, in which the rules change and the meaning of success and wealth have nothing to do with what he has always believed.|0
This movie is great I really enjoyed it.This movie is about a cat mom named Dutchess and her 3 kittens.Turbo is one of the cat's kittens.Then one day turbo get's sucked into a race car .And he becomes fast.He goes in 3 races.He wins all of them.He becomes a superstar for racing.At the end of the race his dad gets him and he goes home with his mother and brothers. My favorite part was when turbo came from the bottom of the race and got sucked into the race car. I like this movie because I like animals.I would rate it 5 stars because it was really cool.|0
First off, I absolutely loved this movie. As a Billy Crystal fan, I must say that I was expecting more comedic situations than I actually got. However, it was nice to see him in a role with more depth and emotion. His portrayal of talent agent Sammy was brilliantly performed and uniquely him. In addition, Gheorghe Muresan (as Maximus) was superb in his first film role. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client on location he has his world turned upside down. He never expected that he would accidentally find the one person who could change his life.|1
The Child's Play series isn't a favourite of mine, but Bride Of Chucky is actually an okay movie. This time we have two dolls Chucky and his former girlfriend (when he was human) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find an object. There are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding, the sex scene between Chucky and Tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place. Wasn't really a straight forward horror, it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre.|1
Head should have been a proud moment not just for its stars ( The Monkees and Victor Mature ) , its director ( Jack Nicholson), its writers ( Robert Getchell and David Merrick), but the Hollywood system in general. Head is the first movie ever to be entirely funded by its stars' residuals and advances on other films. For decades Hollywood had operated on the assumption, based on no real evidence, that audiences would only pay to watch a film if that film was financed by a major studio. Head was the first to test that notion.|0
"I saw Borderline several years ago on AMC . I 've been looking for it ever since . It was a wonderful movie . I am a big Robert Mitchum fan . It has to be one of his very best . I would very much like to buy it if you can find it . Mary, please visit the link below to see a list of Robert Mitchum's films available. http://mitchumfilmcollection.com/mitchum_film_collection.php
We hope that you find what you are looking for. I watched a very old movie on the TCM channel and they said that they do not have permission to release it."|0
This is my favourite Columbo . Martin Landau ( excellent ! ) plays twins , one of whom may have killed his brother . The script has more than a touch of the Hitchcocks about it , with some genuine surprises . I won't give the plot away , except to say I was genuinely gobsmacked by how it ends , but I defy anyone to have guessed it . I've been watching and enjoying Columbo for 40 years now , and I'm still surprised by how many I haven't seen - this is easily the best one of those I've missed .|0
OK so Paris Hilton sucks in it (typical Malibu Barbie) but the rest of the actors are just great! I watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film. Chad Michael Murray IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT and he's just a ace actor. Total hero man. The main girl who is the sister to nick (chad) is such a brilliant actress. Thumbs up. I think it's so different to films out their these days, most of them to go with psychopath's, possessions, ghosts but here you have a theme about wax!|1
A great movie . The movie was even better then the commercials put on . And believe it or not I was a little disappointed when it was all over . I wanted it to keep on going but I guess you can't get much better . I loved the whole idea of it . And I think we would have seen more of it . If the people that wrote it and made it would of had their way . And of course if it was made today . There would be less violence . And that would take a way from it .|0
I do n't usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business , but I have to comment on your excellent review. I have to comment on your review. As for me, I usually don't comment on films, but this is my favorite. As for me, I usually don't comment on films, but I have to say that this one's my favorite. Thank you very much for your useful comment. It was really useful for me. The commentary in your book is really valuable. As I mentioned before I was impressed by the commentary, too.|0
'Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' is a fantastic film in itself . It is nothing like the book , which is a great disappointment . However , the movie is very well put together . The cinematography , the music , and the characters all add up to an excellent movie . The book , however , is even better . The movie cuts out many of the most important elements of the book , which is sad . The book deals much more with the relationships between the villagers and the soldiers , and has much more to do with the war and what the war did to people . '|0
"As many of today 's movies are guilty of , the plot is n't exactly stellar , the movie does have its merits though , first of all the visuals are very good the movie makes very good use of it's budget and the visual effects and action scenes are pretty good considering the budget , and the movie is fun in parts , and has some really funny moments . I was surprised to find that this film was written and directed by the guy who wrote ""The Terminator"" (1984). I'm also surprised that there are no reviews for this movie on IMDb yet."|0
When the new Outer Limits first started , the episodes were quite optimistic and challenging . As the series began to wind down, the shows were darker and more morbid. The show ended up as a 2 part episode. The final 6 shows were in the new series format, with the original opening and closing. The first show was about time travel. In 2021, a man goes back 25 years to 1986 to try and prevent a murder, but instead he gets caught in an accident and his life is saved.|0
I've commented once on this Chucky great, but I had to do it again to say some things about the film, when I first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater. The film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky film ever in a theater, and that was a special moment for me, because I cherish Chucky. The other horror villains are referenced with GREAT COOLNESS!!! And the gore was shockingly great! The scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful!|1
"I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series -- my only detraction would be I didn't think the story was as well-told as others have been in this series. Still, an awesome episode. The scene of Buffy and Angel walking down a sun-drenched street in Los Angeles was pretty great, too, and I'm not sure it would have made as big an impact if it didn't follow this episode. Reactions: puppies
The scene of them walking in sunny LA is so great."|0
SPOILERS BELOW`A Dog's Life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other movie from 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal, exaggerated set pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker gets flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags most successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses up as a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness.|1
( Some spoilers included : ) Although , many commentators have called this film surreal , the term fits poorly . There is no other way to explain the film than as being realistic , and not in the traditional sense . One reviewer has gone as far as saying that it was a piece of crap , and that the reviewer wasted money and time watching the film. That is definitely not the case here . This reviewer has seen some surreal films in his life and this is , by far , the most surreal and disturbing film that this reviewer has ever encountered .|0
There's no point in comparing this with the original series. Though different in look and content, both are true to the original idea. That is, an SF/horror anthology series. Due to indifferent scheduling in Australia, I've only managed to catch a small number of episodes spread over the first few seasons. The very first episode really did give me the creeps (nightmares at my age ...!) but a number of others did fall flat; generally when the stories moved into horror realms and away from SF. I only hope the DVDs reach us eventually.|1
it 's a good watch if u have time - deals with three friends who get into a needless barfight which results in them having to escape to the country to hide out, but it is not long until one of the fighters in the brawl who was not supposed to be there turns up. he ends up killing 1 of them and chasing after the other two. its a pretty slow moving story and some of the camera work is terrible, there are some good scenes and nice atmosphere. i'd recommend this only to the completists as not a lot happens and it takes a while to get going.|0
Really, This movie should be released to DVD. I just got a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was utterly pleased!!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both having been in Romeo & Juliet, and also John Gielghud. sorry about the bad spelling, were in there so on that alone I thought that for the small amount I was spending it would be fine. Boy was I right.|1
Like a few people I know, I came in late on 'Stingers'; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way I'd miss an episode. The show really is that good and has, for a better word, maintained its integrity, unlike 'Blue Heelers', for example. The crime is the thing; personal lives are there but only wheeled out when affecting an investigation! When Gary Sweet was brought in, some fans seemed worried, but he's really fitted in well, which didn't surprise me.|1
"The Aristocats is really quite charming , and is rated far too low on IMDb . The songs are n't the best Disney has ever done but they are all lovely . I'll agree with that and add that, of all the sequels to a ""classic"" animated film, I'd have to say that this is the one I'm most excited to see in 2017. I don't know if it would have made more money in 1981, but I think people would like it just as well today. I know I'll be in theaters watching it this summer."|0
I loved this film ! ! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it ! ! I was not disappointed in this film at all. I am so glad that it came out that way ! I think I cried a little during the last scene. It was so sad yet beautiful. It is so true that the world needs to hear this story. I will buy this film to add to my library. I am looking forward to reading your book. I will let you know when I read it because I will be sure to write a review !|0
"William H. Macy always gives a good performance. He never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else. In short, he's what more actors should be like. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is directed by Steven Schachter, who went on to do two more great films with Macy (Door to Door, The Wool Cap).Television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting, poor cinematography, and sub-par scripting. That's why it's so refreshing to see a TV movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for."|1
What a great film ! I never knew much about Buddy Holly , but was familiar with his lively and melodic music . I really enjoyed seeing and hearing the story behind it . I would recommend this to anyone . Wild , fun , crazy , sad , unfortunate . I loved it ! This was such a funny and enjoyable movie . It had a great sound track and the actors were very talented ! I loved it , it was a really great movie that made me want to learn more about this period of American history . This was a good movie , not the best but very entertaining .|0
When I was 10 ( currently 14 ) , I vowed to never see a movie that I knew would get an R-rating and I never have until a few weeks ago and that movie was the new Batman vs Superman film. You may have heard it's rated PG-13 and is supposed to be an R-rated film so I went in thinking it wasn't actually going to be very violent. I wasn't very impressed by the movie but the part that I was most surprised by was the amount of swearing that went on in the movie.|0
It's Showtime! Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def.Showtime is about two very different cops, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One takes work seriously in a low profile, quiet manner while the other is more easy-going and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat.|1
"(Synopsis) Graduating high school senior Bartleby ""B"" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college to attend. He has been able to talk and con his way out of every problem he encounters, but he hasn't been able to charm his way pass the college admissions board of eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to."|1
"The ""all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring..."" scene was a riot. I also guffawed at the scene in the bar where Hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the Japanese guy and said ""Pearl Harbor buddy"". I think my IQ is higher than 115, but I'm not sure because I can't count that high.Funny thing, this 10 line requirement. Seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long, not too short. I hope I don't make it to 1,000 words before I get to line 10.I'm still two lines short."|1
I had the chance to watch Blind Spot in Barcelona and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it to be one of the most captivating movies that I'd seen for a long time. One of the best points of the film was to meet new fresh faces and great actors behind them in unexpectedly and brilliantly filmed great locations. The three heroes share a chemistry on screen that runs all across the film making it so thrilling. They are set on outstanding landscapes spotted by such an original eye (the DOP's work is just great) that makes you feel like you are discovering them for the first time.|1
A beautifully photographed and paced short film. It evocatively captures the feeling of this family and much of the country during the period just prior to and after Pearl Harbor.I appreciated the visual look of the film -- naturalistic and simultaneously poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd.Though a family film, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that propels the young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he sets out to do what he does.|1
This is a good film for die-hard Chucky fans. Okay I'm sure it's not as good as what the Child's Play movie were like, but this can get really funny and enjoyable, Chucky's laughs are hilarious. (SPOILERS)Now not one doll, but two, meaning double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part really well and definitely pulled off the best kill of the movie.If you have seen the Child's Play movies this would be a worthy film on your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the Child's play movies before, this'll will be a new start.|1
A Formula For Murder is n't a well known Giallo , but that is n't to say it 's not a good one, it's a really good one, with a strong plot that keeps you gripped to the end. I have to admit to not have heard of it before, but once I'd found it I was impressed by the quality. I have to say I much prefer these Giallo 's to the more mainstream Giallo 's, the reason being that they are very dark and twisted in a way that the more well-known aren 't.|0
Not sure why the other comment on this film was so negative , but I loved this movie . I’m going to see it again with a friend who is also going to see the first one with her son , and I can’t wait for that . To each their own but this movie is a 9 out of 10 for me . I just loved it!!!!!!!!! Having just come from seeing this movie I can’t help feeling extremely disappointed in what was presented on screen. The trailer was so exciting and filled with intrigue.|0
Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat ! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the cast of this play which is set in London in 1969 when homosexuality is still considered a crime, the film was a joy to watch. I am a big fan of Emily Watson and have been ever since Gosford Park when I realised that she has the ability to carry an entire film on her own. Rupert Everett does a good job in the role of Maurice, a respectable professor of Classics at Cambridge who has suppressed his true sexuality because of his family.|0
Considering it 's basically low-budget cast , this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock star. Even if they don't seem that good actors , the guys manage to give the movie an authenticity that most of the movies on this theme are missing . And the songs are good too , especially when the band is playing live ! I've seen much better music biopics but it's still a pretty decent movie that I recommend ! Rock and roll is about sex, drugs, and a little bit of Rock and roll .|0
Despite all the hoopla about THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode , THE BALANCE OF TERROR might just be the best first season episode of TOS. It had great characterization and a taut script. I think it's one of the only episodes that was actually filmed at Vasquez Rocks park, too! I am glad they did not make another series of Twilight Zone but rather this show. I really like this show. It is kind of like the new Outer Limits. This show is one of the best sci-fi shows I have seen and I like it better than the new Outer Limits.|0
Gary Busey did a splendid job playing the rock-n-roll legend Buddy Holly ( 1936-59 ) . He does have a resemblance to Holly , but I think it's his outrageous style that made me think that the movie was more of an entertainment than a documentary. But I don't want to complain , because this movie does have it's moments that are very true to history . Buddy Holly's career was short in duration but he managed to make a lot of great songs that are still heard today. I'm sure that he would be surprised by his popularity today , especially with the younger generation .|0
Due to its predictable , second-rate title , ( the one it was distributed under in Italy , at least) it’s quite easy to dismiss Tinto Brass’ The Howler as a typical exploitation flick , but it’s actually quite better than most of the genre . The Howler is not a film for the faint-hearted, and if you’re offended by sexually-explicit films, you might want to avert your eyes here . It’s not quite the hardcore smut it was marketed as, though, and the sexual content is certainly no more extreme than what you’ve likely already seen .|0
This is sweet. The actress who played the nurse with the gonzongas is the same actress who plays Elvira mistress of the dark. Another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of Roy Munsin in King Pin. This is most glorious story ever to be told. It should sell more copies than the bible. My parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater. The movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it.|1
Indeed , Cynthia Watros is in this movie as Elizabeth talking to Desmond . Though I 'm just wondering how come I didn't recognize her , when I usually do , since she is in so many things that i have seen . I have no idea as to why , but I do think it is one of her better performances in recent years , if you like to see her doing something other than ER or the Practice . I have not seen it all yet so that is not the only reason why I think it is good so far .|0
They Made Me a Criminal is a remake of an earlier Warner Brothers film , The Life of Jimmy Dolan (1933). It stars Bonita Granville as a girl who is falsely accused of a crime and who goes to prison. Also in the cast are Peter Lind Hayes as a newspaper reporter who is on her side, Kent Taylor as her boyfriend, and Edward Norris as the prison warden who tries to help her. What's it about? The story is about a small-time hood who finds himself framed and thrown into jail. When he escapes, he decides to find out who put him behind bars.|0
"What a shame this movie was never released . ( It is now playing on cable . ) I tuned in half way through it . I was very disappointed , not because of the quality of the film but because I never even knew this existed. It is so strange that a movie like this could be released today and yet in 1968 they could not get it into the theaters . I loved the 1973 version of ""Cabaret"" , but this movie is even better . I watched the 1973 one last night and then watched this one . It is a very different movie ."|0
Remember that this came out before Gulf War I , which gave us Werner Herzog 's `` Lessons of Darkness ,'' an eerily similar documentary that explored the desert's strange beauty and also its capacity for utter destruction. I know that I may not be the best person to review `Alien', because I am a big fan of the series and of the original `Alien' movie in particular. It was one of the first movies that I saw on video as a child and it had a profound impact on me.|0
