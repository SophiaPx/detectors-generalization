John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture, 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indian-cavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie, full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically, it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film, and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons...|1
A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. There is a whole village there and the villagers look exactly like the Mormons, except that they do not wear hats. This movie makes absolutely no sense and I really wanted it to be over. The only explanation I can think of is that one or two of the guys in the movie actually wrote the script (although how that could be worked out by the producers is beyond me). If this screenplay was actually written by a professional screenwriter/director it would certainly be better than this.|0
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars! I really don't care what people can say badly about this movie...because it's a really well played parts from Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly by Christina Ricci!! I'm a big fan of hers, right since I saw her in Addams Family...been trying to watch all things she makes, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played!! I love her looks (even though people say she's not pretty...I think she is...and I love her eyes)!!|1
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin."|1
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore . I 'm sure it pisses a few liberals off . It does not. The main problem the film has is, well it has nothing to do with anything that actually happened in real life. There were a number of major scientific and political events that occurred in the USA in the 90's , but none of them made any mention of Al Gore. There are two possible explanations for how this movie got made. Firstly it could have been planned to be a huge hit which would help make up for all of its shortcomings.|0
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the spotlight on his own family, Block covers terrain that is off-limits for most filmmakers. He explores a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without resorting to hyperbole or sensationalism. In fact, the film is deceptively low key at the outset. In addition to providing a probing look at one family - and, by extension, every family - Block has also chronicled a very specific period in recent history. I don't know if this was intentional, but unavoidable due to archival content.Highly recommended.|1
SPOILERS AHEAD------------------------- Mel has got it going on. From the opening credits to the ending credits this movie has straight laughs. Dave Chappel shows why he is a comedic force. Cary Eewes carries the movie most of the time, but the supporting cast fills in strong when the plot is drawn away from Robin Hood. Right from the beginning this movie proclaims it's self not to be taken seriously. If you took a time machine and gave the characters thoughts of modern day antics you would get this movie.|1
"- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying. In their escape, the bandits split up. The one thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to talk. Three men have a different part of the ""clue"" that will lead to the gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the bounty hunter work together to locate the missing loot? Or, will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."|1
i love this show! it is amazing...i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the parts......i love Gilmore girls! i've gotten all my friends to watch it. even their parents watch it now. i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day. i wish my mom was like Lorelei. my friends say that i talk and act like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it.|1
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome ; more bloodshed and very graphic details ( a bit too much for my own tastes ) . This is the movie that started me down a dark path of making films . And I am sorry it did.I know there are no spoilers , so I won't give away anything but I will say one thing: watch this movie or you will have a very bad trip . If you like Se7en , don't watch this . This is one of those movies where you just can't help but laugh, because the story is such a ridiculous one.The characters are completely unsympathetic!|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
"The above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film, as the series followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar (""The Saint"") meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as ""Pearly"" Gates) and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery (none of them really are), Templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool!"|1
This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged. Great acting, directing - and it is Canadian to boot! It is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers. The locations in Ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick. For any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle - be it financial or illness - this film strikes a resounding chord!|1
I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film. I had just seen the MOOG doc, which was alright, the only problem was Moog led a very content life, and the doc was well... content. Haack's story is filled with all the marketable tragedy people buy into these days, but it carries a great deal of heart with it. Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much, one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE.|1
"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud."|1
Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog, filmed over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on. It is a visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) imagery that is timeless. You simply could not tell that it was made over thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack to the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel), and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lends its timeless quality.|1
* * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * THE CELL / ( 2000 ) MELANIE O'HARA. Now that is a hard film! The first twenty minutes are like a bad horror/comedy, and then you get to the good part where we meet all the characters in their natural setting... And it doesn't really end well. I have no idea what was going on with the director, he's not an original storyteller and seems to be using people from his other films for his own purposes. What happened? My first viewing of this movie shocked the hell out of me.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like you murders, to be signature and serial, and your cops to be British, and shout a lot, and the gore to be bloody and have a religious slant then this hits every button. Not quite enough 'gov'ing to put the shouting into the Sweeney's rarefied heights, but otherwise highly rated. Ken Stott is excellent as the 'cop on the edge' and the guest stars are also well cast, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom , which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the people, and put them to use for something else.The show started out good, then went downhill into the worst possible way.It had some good scenes and funny moments. However, it would take over 30 minutes of my life just to explain how awful this program was. There is no better way to make sure your family does not fall victim to pornography than to spend all of your free time watching TONIGHT & SUNDAYS. I can honestly say that this show is even worse than those two programs combined.|0
"Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award . It is a beautiful piece of animation. This movie is in 2 parts, The beginning and the middle. This film starts off with a dream sequence. A little girl falls asleep on her bed. As she sleeps, her parents call her name from behind. She wakes up to find herself in front of a large picture window. Inside there is an old fashioned clock that reads 9:00 AM. She calls out ""9:00!"|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies , along with Spaceballs ( although I will openly admit that I watched Spaceballs for the first time a decade or so later when I rewatched it in a theatre). However, I must say that this is a very different kind of film. I'm not a huge fan of the old Mel Brooks films nor do I really have any other fond memories of them. But after seeing The Producers I couldn't help but notice how many similarities were found between the story of the film and the plot of the film.|0
This one started excellently. The photography and audio are the best I've experienced in years (okay, months). Especially the use of 'warm' and 'cold' colours in single sequences is astonishing. Also, making Jennifer Lopez whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure what Singh wants to accomplish with that.Now for the minuses. The screenplay was awful. Lopez's part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot. She seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the pic. The three beds seemed just too obvious.|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic ""Alive"", there already was the legendary Mexican exploitation director René Cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film ""Supervivientes de los Andes"". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 that crashed in the Argentinian Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow-passengers."|1
"Surprisingly good made for T.V . Thriller . I was n't expecting too much from this one but I 'm glad I did.. I don't know if anyone has seen this film yet or not, but I've always found it a bit disconcerting. I have read a few reviews praising it in the past as ""good"" or ""exciting"", which to me means that it isn't worth seeing unless you are really interested in what happens. It certainly doesn't feel like an interesting movie on the whole, though it is surprisingly good for T.V."|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good:The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is done beautifully.It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined.David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better.The Bad:There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old ( I hold a different belief). Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.|1
I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations , discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional and mental problems. But, that's the point. Why was I resisting it? I'm not gonna lie: I actually love this film. It has its moments. It is a very well-made film with terrific acting, especially by Mark Hamill in his role as Captain Kirk. You can see the affection he feels for William Shatner as well. There is even a little comedy in this film--though it seems to be done in a cheap way.|0
The philosophical, meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind. I'd give it 10 stars for that alone. That being said, though, what hit me with particular force was what I take, possibly incorrectly, to be its Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich concoction of color blends seemingly based on very understated Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes, but, to me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself.|1
This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew, a narrative depth superior to most novels, wonderful music, philosophy and a connection to LIFE that I find difficult to explain. To immerse oneself in Die Zweite Heimat is for me akin to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe one gets when looking at the stars in a clear night sky. The language, and use of both colour and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the locations, including the Edgar Reitz office.|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and , as mysteries should , does so without sacrificing any of the action or suspense. However, there was one huge mistake that I think will take away from this film: The character development. I went into this film thinking it was going to be some really good sci fi flick. I ended up just hating it.The characters seemed like cardboard cutouts who didn't do anything but stand around doing nothing. There were lots of pointless dialogs which simply had no connection to what was going on.|0
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that's been released lately. It was funny, but it also had many touching moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, & the rest of the cast made their incredibly weird characters seem real. The story took such twist & turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula movies, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!|1
"Do n't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . This time it's about a man who has an affair with a woman and wants to end his marriage. After I finished watching ""Jane Eyre"", I couldn't help but think, why is anyone still seeing this movie?The plot of this movie takes place in England, circa 1700. The story revolves around two men, John and Richard, who have an affair. As their affair grows, John and Richard are constantly in conflict with each other."|0
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I enjoyed stories of mountain men and the wilderness. Books like ""Call of the Wild"", ""White Fang"", ""The Frontiersman"" and ""My Side Of the Mountain"", influenced me tremendously. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me more to do so, than when I saw this movie on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like ""Trapper""."|1
How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film ? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and a wonderful artist. It is very sad to see his name in all these bad reviews, especially since he was a huge star in his day. This movie is awful. The plot has nothing to do with science. It's not even about space.The special effects are laughable - the spaceship appears to float across the sky by sheer force of will, but no-one can see it.I am a huge Mel Brooks fan, and I think his movies are funny.|0
"Very good ""Precoder"" starring Dick Barthelmess, which in a way, kind of reminded me of Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939), in which Barthelmess also acted. This film was directed by masterful William Wellman, who was responsible for the landmark aviation Silent picture ""Wings"".Barthelmess plays a devil-may-care airplane pilot, who is a blamed for an aviation accident. Afterwards he meets and falls for pretty Sally Eilers, who participates as part of an Act in an itinerant Air Circus; but when Barthelmess' brother appears in scene, a triangular relationship ensues."|1
"This is how I interpreted the movie: First things first. There was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be told of the gals. In the end too, u see Taylor disappear as he walks. Looks like the message there was ""There was no Taylor"". And the whole movie was a figment of imagination of Ben. Also, there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as Ben."|1
`` The Cell '' is an exotic masterpiece , a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a man (and woman) who has been in prison for almost two decades, but also the surreal world we inhabit when it comes to the concept of reality itself. It is hard to say how much you actually know about this movie at any given moment, but it seems pretty safe to say that most people who have seen it would agree with me on that point. There is something so strangely beautiful about the camera work, the production values and the overall style of this odd film.|0
GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen.. He acts it up, perfectly. This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is.. It almost made me cry watching him.I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits.. Very sad, what both of them went through.I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times.|1
"Very good `` Precoder '' starring Dick Barthelmess , which in a way , kind of reminded me of Hawks and his work. He plays the character ""Barthelmess"" (Dick's name) who makes it to the top, but is then thrown off course by some other people he met at an opera. I don't think this has any redeeming features. I would give it zero stars if I could.The acting is not only awful, but downright horrible. It goes from one terrible scene to the next without ever really settling into its tone or mood."|0
"The ""Hunting Trilogy"" of Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952), and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the comedic high water mark of the Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese collaboration. While they are seldom mentioned in lists of the ""greatest"" or ""most important"" cartoons in the history of animation, they are certainly THE FUNNIEST cartoons I've ever seen. Michael Maltese never got the credit that directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery got, but it's his dialogue and situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIEST ever made."|1
Maybe it's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a fondness for things Egyptian (I grew up loving to visit the mummies in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts) but I think Maltin is a tad tough on this rather good film. The production values are great regarding color and cinematography, and it appears some effort went into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is admittedly a bit stiff in the lead role, but one can accept this as part of Sinuhe's character.|1
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed . Very funny and the production quality is outstanding . It is not easy to watch, but if you can see past the bad acting, this is probably one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a while. I was pretty disappointed when I saw this movie at the theater last night after hearing about it on IMDB , but I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got my hands on it today. The script is so good, it almost doesn't need to be read.|0
I wanted to watch this, to get a inside look at the show. It told the story more of Robin Williams, then Mork & Mindy. Still, thought it was great. We got to see, Robin always being 'on', no matter what. The performance of Diamontopolous was awesome.The introductions of the main players, seem so real to me. Roebuck as Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows (Happy Days, and Laverne & Shirley), was enlightening.|1
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 of gold , along with a banker Clayton , who 's about to get arrested for the same offense. This movie has nothing in common with other movies made about this subject, as they all tend to fall into different genre categories.I like this film because it deals with the problems faced by those who make a living by using their money to influence the lives of others (i.e., politicians). However, I still can't see what the whole point of the movie is. Why would people want to donate so much money to these individuals?|0
"Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie . Amy Jo Johnson ( Susie Q ) is a great Actress , she is a good looking and beautiful Actress .I have watched many of Amy Jo Johnson's movies . So i just bought this movie, on impulse but i really wanted to like it..i liked the original film so much i couldn't be mad at this one. i saw the trailer and i thought it was nice, i'm pretty sure as a person who hasn't seen ""Lincoln"", i'll like this one a lot more."|0
"I just started watching The Show around July . I found it by mistake , I was channel surfing during the movie and I saw my name. I have to say I didn't really think it would be a hit , but boy was I wrong. This is one of those rare ""dumb sitcoms"" that is both funny and deep in its themes about the power of music. I don't know why everyone complains about this show. After watching for 20 minutes i'm starting to get it.The problem is that there is too much bad acting/writing."|0
Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard--you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream, but created it. For those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera--How often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film? It is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies were doing: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully.|1
"""Jaded"" should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like ""Indecent Behavior"" or ""Friend Of The Family"". ""Jaded"" is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't (in my opinion) a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie."|1
This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their `` Erasmus year '' in London and Berlin. The movie focuses on three people from different backgrounds - a German, a Japanese and a French - who make friends and become good friends over the course of their long visit. They also get caught up in other personal issues they are involved with while living there. There are some funny bits at times but most of the time I thought the movie was too short and lacked depth to justify what it offered (and I mean all its characters).|0
"I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old. I knew nothing of westerns then but recognized Ben Johnson from the movie ""Mighty Joe Young."" What attracted me to ""Wagon Master"" were the great songs sung by the ""Sons of the Pioneers."" Merian C. Cooper, who produced the movie, was the first to commission original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong."|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments , Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air . The film follows two nurses who, after losing their patients, return to the rural town for a second chance at life. However, while the town gets some much needed help, one nurse's dreams come to a screeching halt. I didn't know anyone else could get so many wasted lines right on a film like this, but it seems as though I'm not alone. This film is filled with clichés that only make the film worse.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it! This movie has great suspense, great acting, very well done camera work (nice job Mr. Lieberman!) which makes a extremely well made slasher! Though low on gore for the 80s, it still has the effect on you after it is over. The opening kill (machete through the crotch) looked so real! And the fist to the mouth death left me stunned! Overall i give this lost classic 10 stars out of 10 stars!|1
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch . She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of a wealthy woman that had no problem taking advantage of the vulnerable young. Very disappointing! The plot is very vague, and the characters are too simplistic to get any sense out of. There are two main characters, and one supporting character (a prostitute), and each has their own personality. You don't get to know these two characters very well, or understand what makes them tick. As for the supporting characters, they have very little screen time - which makes them seem forced.|0
"This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band 's 30 year career . Lee , Bobby and Gary were so well together that some of the more obscure or hard to get songs got their due credit in the show. The setlist had many classics from the era - I'm looking at you ""You Gotta Believe Me"" and ""Somewhere, Somewhere"". The audience was loud and interesting and really fun to listen to. I am an avid fan of Bob Dylan, having attended every concert he has played."|0
I love to see a female protagonist , in this movie her name was Rose . Rose brought out a lot of character, that I didn't think would have ever made it to the screen. I can't imagine how bad she must have felt having to kill people. I'm not exaggerating here, I'd say she had an orgasm every time she shot a person. She was so cool about it. It was great to see a movie like this on TV. I saw this yesterday on cable and it has to be one of my all time worst movies.|0
"I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie . But at the earnest request of the reviewers, I watched it anyways. This movie is not very scary and if you have never read any of Stephen King's works you won't learn much about what is happening. This movie does a pretty good job of making you want to laugh, but that isn't really the point. The ""gag"" here is an odd one -- the kids are afraid of the creepy clowns, who scare them into doing something horrific."|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned down old hotel, where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning. Most of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it wasn't the best writing or the best ever. I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done. Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs. The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girl's mouth. Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor, he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change.|1
"I loved this movie! OH MY GOSH! This movie rocked so hard! I found it amongst some old tapes and didn't know what it was and after having read the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (Which btw, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the film more times than it mentioned what the film was actually about. ), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. ""What controversy?"""|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series , but viewed it for the first time this week , July 11, 2006. I have to say I found it extremely disturbing.The storyline is so horrible, that I cannot put it into words. There is not a single character or scene in this show that has any merit at all.It starts off with a girl (the main female protagonist) talking about how hard life must be when she lives in a remote location with an alcoholic father and no money to buy food.|0
"it 's the best movie i have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! i just love them ! it is a great movie all the way through , even when you don't like the subject. this movie really makes you question yourself as a person, who would want to be so blind ? what can anyone know of another world ? if i was a vampire i'd go to hell for watching this ! they should make more films like this ! ""The Last Vampire"" might be the worst vampire film ever made! This movie is a complete rip off of Stephen King's novel."|0
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so enraptured in Orry and Madenline's love story. I am a hopeless romantic so it really got to me. I especially liked it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in Book three I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand that because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie.|1
Our America is multi-cultural , with so many sub-cultures . This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time from the viewpoint of two people who do not belong anywhere near one another. This was an extremely boring and unfunny mess that failed to take advantage of its premise. While it certainly does have its moments, it also fails to move forward any further than what was established in the first three acts. The only reason I kept watching was out of morbid curiosity, which has never made me like a movie.|0
"Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that . I got all the tapes ,the DVD,the dvd,and the blu ray and i was going to get this movie before any one else because it was my favourite action movie but then i found out there was no Dads Army at all. Then i went to youtube and took a look at the first 3 minutes and i saw ""Dads Army 1"". So i searched on youtube for Dads Army 1 until i finally found it. When i saw the name it made me want to just buy the DVD and rent it."|0
This film had me spellbound this evening . Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted . John Voight was magnificent in this role . You will be sorry you missed it.If you're a fan of movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and Halloween, you will be pleased by this one . I am not a horror movie fan but this was quite enjoyable. The acting was very good; the effects were pretty impressive as well. It's not a long film but it was really scary when it hit home.|0
"Graphics is far from the best part of the game . This is the number one best TH game in my opinion, and if I'm gonna call this ""good"", then at least it'll be something I won't forget about anytime soon! This is like playing the first game in a series. The same people that made Bionic Commando have been working on this for the better part of two decades with absolutely no improvement. The story is very similar to B2, and the graphics are basically the same. It takes you back to the good ol' Days before video games."|0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)""Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things."" --Catherine DeaneAnd so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, ""The Cell"" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it."|1
I saw the Messiah : - The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes on TV at the time, even though it was shot a long way away. The show was very good, with great acting and wonderful camerawork, which gave the programme an air of authenticity and respectability that didn't exist before. However, there were two major problems. The problem with this show is that it's extremely shallow and predictable. They don't seem to know who the main characters are or what they are fighting for.|0
Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth watching, I recently watched it because I've just become a Cary Elwes fan, and this is one of of his lead-roles. Some moments really made me crack up so hard! I didn't expect them you know, it was so funny, Even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair The cast is great, of course especially Robin of Locksley himself,Cary, but Blinkin and the Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it's veryy big!|1
"I have watched this show from the beginning , and I am a 45 year old man . To me it's like some kind of ""B-movie"" that could be made today for $10 million or so. It starts out slow and slowly builds on itself, but doesn't really come to a head until about an hour into the show. If you think that's a bad thing, try looking at the credits. Most of them say ""Written and Directed by Gary Moore"". This show has no personality at all."|0
I first saw this movie on TV back in 1959 when I was eight years old . I knew nothing about it, other than what I could find in my family's old movies, so I sat through the first 10 minutes because that's all I did then. I don't recall ever being able to sit through 20 minutes at a time. It just didn't seem possible to me. Then, I thought about it for two months and finally decided I must be wrong. This film is absolutely awful.The story is very boring. Every character is forced to do whatever the plot requires.|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule. And amazingly I found it really original. I have commented on other Colombian films before, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to make reference to the average vulgar people,especially trying to make jokes out of the continuous cursing. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not especially exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how real people speak.|1
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways. It is a non stop plethora of emotion and taboo subjects. Sex and love. Women's emotional abuse of men, Men's physical abuse of women, Sexual child abuse, Fresh approach to religion in real life, and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music.I promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and bettering of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect.|1
Don't watch this movie expecting the Jane Austen wit, crisp dialog or clever social commentary. This time around, the premise of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! In this version,Catherine's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies, but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures. By day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the utmost courtesy. But as her own sexual nature awakens, her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid!|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about . Or , maybe that they can see a bit more of the bigger picture in the movie . And if you can't get past that, I'd suggest not to even bother watching the movie at all. If you want to enjoy this story then just give it a chance and find out where it went wrong . The movie is basically an attempt by the director/screenwriter to tell his fans that he's got the whole thing wrapped up in a nice bow and has them ready to jump in and enjoy the fun .|0
"See No Evil With Kane . The Movie Has a great storyline But it just was n't a Hide my face movie... I really didn't think I would have to write a review about a movie with no dialogue. After all, the only real good movie I can think of that doesn't have any dialogue is ""Kane"" (and yes, there were other movies that weren't as good as ""Kane"" or had more dialogue.) However, here I will say that this film is a total mess."|0
"This was an excellent show . It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (I think) being the first to admit that it was ""not as good as TV"" but she also said that it had some nice stories. The characters were intriguing and well acted. I am a huge fan of this show. My brother and I grew up seeing it every summer when it was going to air on Channel 8. We have not seen it since we moved out of the state and haven't heard from anyone who still watches it."|0
I'm seen this documentary in its feature-form, in a movie theatre. And... wouah! The pictures are astonishing, one really wonder how by Jove did they manage to film those waves, those animals, those... is that a plant ? a predator ? a creature from the movie Abbyss ? Anyway, it's remarkable. Sure we've seen a lot of such documentary on TV, with weird animals and so on, but none with such a beauty, a precision, a deep emotion. The only downside is the commentary.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper, which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments, with very funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film occurs naturally, and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately & haven't been too worked at. It really is very funny, thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast, and that each actor/actress recognises and can relate to the Aussie humor. They portray it very well and very realistically.|1
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim ( Richard Barthelmess ) who has one bad flight in a row. He finds out that he's on his last legs when he decides to fly home. I love this film, it is by far the most entertaining I have ever seen. If anything I am disappointed at how little screen time there is for Jack Nicholson as he was much more interesting in this film. Michael Douglas does an incredible job as the leader of the air force, well worth watching.|0
Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster ( a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV 's `` Land of the Lost '') as an electrical engineer working at a radio station. The show was popular in its time, but has lost steam with viewers since it began. For some reason this movie wasn't released to the public. I've heard it referred to as a horror movie for some unknown reason. Well, it isn't any horror movie, and I can say with complete confidence that this is absolutely not one of those. There is nothing scary about it whatsoever.|0
"I viewed The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything, and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well meshed and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and crew well. But it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' tight script was just what this evening of ""shorts"" needed. It neither meandered, as several offerings did, or preached to us. The Reader was simple story telling in it's best form, well cast by Rogers and beautifully acted."|1
"Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic `` Alive '' , there was one more film that gave me chills and made me think I had seen the greatest of all time. It was actually only about 5 minutes long so I guess it's not too bad but I never thought it would make it onto this list!The film is called ""A New Hope"". To tell you the truth, it might just be my first film. But as I grew up, I felt that Star Wars was the greatest movie ever made."|0
In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet first the broken wagon without water of the quack Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic outlaws Clegg boys decide to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol leaded by the Sheriff of Crystal City that is chasing them.|1
This is how I interpreted the movie : First things first . There was not a single scene in the movie which made any sense to me. Why didn't somebody have the audacity to create an entire new genre from scratch, then take a shot at it and try to make it fun ? It seemed too contrived for my taste. And that's about all. The main characters were either moronic or very unimportant. Some of them had such a low-class air that if they spoke in their own voice, nobody would ever remember them.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty , a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse , who is infatuated with a handsome man. I first heard of this movie over ten years ago when I rented it from a copycat rental shop in LA. At the time I wasn't much of a film fan, so I didn't think too highly of it. In fact, as an adult (and living in New York City at the time), I couldn't stand it. There was nothing interesting about it, but it certainly had its moments.|0
"Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm , wit , and charm . At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gets her first television role on the hit TV series. The only catch was she was too stupid to be on the show, so when she did appear (in this case in an episode called ""The Other Woman"") it was for the same character as the real Lorelai: Emily. I don't know if you've ever heard of this, but it must have been around at some point in history."|0
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements . I think they were trying to capture what you 'd expect from a music video. But it isn't really like that. The music and acting in this would seem to be coming from a different place, which would explain how they managed to make it work. This is an entertaining (for a horror film) but poorly-edited documentary on the life of legendary rock singer ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" It's hard not to smile as the camera crew follows the musician throughout the day, every time he looks at the camera."|0
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a truly moving experience. I had heard of the Truth and Reconcilliation process, but as others have written, did not know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts, understand the events from the points of view of others involved, and grieve together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in developing the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions.|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this . I have no idea and i can't believe that they're still going with this crap. My parents were absolutely horrified to see this movie in a rental store. I saw it at the theater and it was so far above average that I forgot all about it until I got home late at night. The only good thing about this movie is that you don't need much imagination to make it funny. And there was a LOT of laughter in this one.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class . The musicianship of this band is incredible and these guys should be in every rock concert hall.I am so glad I got my copy of this book, it is now one of my favorites! I have always been a big fan of Neil Young's songs but I've never really understood the fascination he has with him. He is a very funny guy who doesn't give a damn about music, or what you think he is. He just likes to make people laugh.|0
"I 'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of my movie. In fact, many of them seemed to be making a point about how awful it was because they didn't want to see it. (If you don't believe me, watch the film yourself, and judge for yourself.) I'm so tired of seeing what has to be the least intelligent comments posted in every review I've ever read at IMDb. ""It's horrible,"" ""This is terrible!"" ""Oh my god, that sucks!"""|0
Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I begin ? The years of hard work paid off in what is surely the best special effects movie ever. As a child I was enthralled with the amazing sets, the action sequences and the incredible creature designs. So when I finally watched this movie it took me by surprise. There was almost nothing in the movie to make me believe it was actually happening, and the entire plot seems so contrived and nonsensical that there is no way I should be able to sit through another half an hour of this.|0
"These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny (and fun) puns. The first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates: ""Alka-Fizz Prison - No Noose Is Good Noose."" Inside the prison, the first sign we see is ""Welcome: have a seat."" They then show an electric chair.Corny gives way to clever, however, as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With pen in hand, he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it!"|1
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Artistic Values such as Love and Beauty to more modern interpretations that deal with issues of race, politics, family, and the war. I read this movie when I was about ten. It was a horror movie, but I don't think it could have been considered an 'horror'. It was a story of survival. The only thing that really killed me during the film was the lack of any suspense at all. In my opinion, there is no good explanation for why these people survived.|0
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission , I can only look at this as a cynical attempt to justify the actions of the Canadian government that resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The truth is not in these documents, but it does give us an idea of where they came from. This review is going to be a little harsh because I didn't want to like this movie, but it was so bad...I could hardly stand it. I'm talking about the fact that it's hard to see anything positive or important happen in it.|0
"George Cuckor, known as a director of women, couldn't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful women for his last film. Itself a remake of Bette Davis' campy ""Old Acquaintance"" written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated, but still delightful.Bergen and Bisset sparkle as best friends who compete at everything, but manage to remain friends. Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a ""serious"" writer, intellectual, and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend Merry Noel at an exclusive girls school and they begin a lifetime of not always friendly competition."|1
when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique. it was a series and i even did not know someone in it. later on, i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard (a movie, i absolutely adore). i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since. it's just fun. you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time.|1
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be very scary. I watched the entire thing because I thought, ""What's with this stupid shit? This will make me laugh more than anything,"" but instead I got so scared and sickened by it that I couldn't help myself from crying like a baby. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen and definitely the WORST film ever made. In the mid-'70s Hollywood was in the midst of a boom as they began to make some of the best films in the history of cinema."|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of men and women in our society, and it takes aim at them. This leads to some really interesting and well thought-out comments that are a real breath of fresh air on many topics. I like American Horror Story and enjoy watching it but I'm not sure why. The movie starts off so well, but then it turns out the writers just didn't know any better. I was really expecting something truly shocking or shocking for the sake of shocking.|0
I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams for that entire show, was Emmy worthy. It was uncanny how well he did. And to be as rapid-fire and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is....WOW. There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines, all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well, that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes.|1
"Wagon Master ( 1950 ) Dir : John Ford Production : Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings us a tale of two wagons on a long journey to the North American wilderness, and he makes one thing abundantly clear. His characters are nothing more than caricatures. I am not sure who was supposed to be angry at him, but neither do I understand why the film was made in the first place. ""Paint This Town Black"" is just another example of the low budget exploitation films that we have become so used to these past years."|0
It came before `` the ten commandments '' `` land of the Pharaohs '' `` Ben Hur '' and it was called `` The Story of Noah '' because it had a lot of religious overtones. However, in this one we actually get to hear the story of Noah's Ark. And there are some really cool effects on this film that I can't take credit for. Most of these effects you'd have to pay $200 for to make yourself believe. But I think they were quite effective. This may be the most pathetic film I have seen in a long time.|0
"In ""Black Snake Moan,"" writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me felt like dismissing the entire film as pretentious--a sweltering Southern parable with some oh-so-risky subject matter. The movie also contains a heavy spiritual subtext where religion is being hauled into the picture--again, this is integrated without subtlety. After the darker opening scenes, the film increasingly blunts its edge until the entire production comes off with the artificial quality of a stage play (and I'll admit, the last 15 minutes go way too far into ""Happy Ending"" territory for my liking)."|1
"Just see it ! It 's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time . See it from beginning to end ! I have been looking forward to this movie for about 2 days. This is NOT one of those ""what should I watch on cable TV?"" movies where you get a show or movie and then go home and watch it again. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE OF THE WEEK EVER. Why? Because it's just plain good. I don't even know why I went into this movie with expectations. It seemed like it had the potential to suck."|0
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school team, after his father is accused of committing suicide. Unfortunately it gets worse. When I first saw the film (in theaters), I fell in love immediately. This is one of those movies that will make you want to go see it again and again. It's a wonderful blend of melodramatic suspense thriller and dark comedy. I found this movie so funny, as I never thought I'd find anything so hilarious in a horror film.|0
"Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice pronounces the words ""Puerto Rican"" is very funny, as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie, called ""Old Acquaintance"", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along, so because the movie is about female friendship, that might have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other."|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through. It has a great ensemble of characters, an origional plot, and an ending I shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings.If theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock's interaction. These two are great and it warms my heart to see Rock isn't going to do crappy Big Hollywood fare like Lethal Weapon 4 for the rest of his life. Freeman is as always the man, really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore.|1
I 'm a fan of independent film . Dialogue driven , character study pieces are where it 's at for me. This film had the potential to be excellent. Unfortunately, there was so much going on I couldn't care anymore about anything other than my own misery.The whole film seemed to revolve around two very different men (one male and one female) who get separated in a war. The woman finds herself living with her father and is taken into custody by the government. There are a few scenes of her talking to her daughter and trying to figure out what is wrong.|0
"The Killing Yard is a great film, although uneven at times. Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and judicially jilted prison inmate, and the presence of Alan Alda as his defense attorney is none other than genius. The emotion and raw reality portrayed in this film's ""flashback"" scenes have the ability of putting viewers directly into the midst of the events being pictured. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, however, through extensive research, I find that ""The Killing Yard"" does the story all of it's fair justices."|1
"'The Cell ' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally . The film begins with a man named Raul (Juan Carlos Carrión) who is being pursued by the police for sexual deviancy after he kills his wife and then rapes her corpse. He's not too keen on letting the authorities track him down either as there are some very nasty men in the neighbourhood. If you're thinking of buying this movie, watch out. You may get to see the worst possible version of ""The Cell"" ever made!"|0
This is definitely an excellent show. I don't have cable, so I started renting them, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be a teen soap, you know, who's dating who, that kind of thing. But it was not. It is surprisingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it. It is a comedy-drama, which is rare when well done. It is about Rory and Lorelai's relationship.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dance filled with brilliant dancing, music and choreography! The leads, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne had me captivated with their exquisite dancing! May they always keep shining and keep dancing. Their on stage chemistry was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They look like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my absolute favourite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!|1
I'm certain that people from USA don't know anything about the rest of the world, but I think they mustn't talk about what they don't know. And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the USA. The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the USA and Islamic nations. In France, for instance, the age of consent is 15. In Brazil it's 14. In Spain it's 12. So the teenagers actors, 16 and 17 years old by the time of production, aren't doing anything illegal.|1
Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once, and was missing for nearly two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's 'La Gioconda' (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief (and former Louvre employee) who allegedly sought to return the world's most famous piece of art to its native Italy. His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.)|1
I 'm not gon na lie . To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is blue . The film doesn't make much sense.It's all there . I just found myself thinking about it more and more. There are a LOT of things I'm missing here. This is the kind of movie you watch because you want to, not because you actually HAVE to! It's a little bit weird but at the same time it's kinda hilarious. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it much either. Maybe it's because I was a little too self-involved with the characters.|0
"I have been a ""huge"" rush fan ever since ""moving pictures"" and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why Rush is so popular. They completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet, and, despite the rain in a soccer arena, they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish. A real example of this is during ""yyz"" the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner, in perfect sinc. They really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful ""lust"" that rarely happens anymore."|1
"I'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things. However, SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling. Rose plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled. It was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to ""get tea"" and I felt compelled to have a shower."|1
Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this.|1
i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store where i used to hang out with people who were good at movies and i tried to convince them that this movie was worth watching because i knew how much i would love it but they just wouldn't believe me and now i find myself wondering why the hell am i even bothering to try to get my money back from this movie which i paid for . It is just not worth it . If you have kids, make sure to check this one out.|0
If you are a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star oldie is a good one. What more could you ask for than Duke, Yak, and Gabby. Lots of good ridin' and shootin'!!! I found it amazing that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It has been reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, so twin brother Bill may have been too. Anyway, if you like good, clean, early western movies don't miss this one.|1
North and South is a miniseries from the `` golden age '' of television miniseries in the 1980s , which I believe is not an accurate statement.In this show there is absolutely nothing to suggest that these characters or situations are relatable to our world. A friend of mine was at a party last night with her husband and two children. The TV was on, so she could watch what was going on during the party. But instead of being interested in what was actually happening, she started talking about the news. About how it was a bad movie. A terrible movie.|0
This movie is complex and interesting in so many ways . It is a non stop plethora of emotion and suspense . There has to be a reason this movie took so long to come out on the market . I think the director was trying to cover his tracks but failed miserably as he did not try hard enough to make every character feel real . I felt sorry for the characters because they were just plain flat. The plot was weak and uninteresting . The first thing that struck me about this movie, was the sheer amount of money it takes to put something like this together.|0
"when the gilmore girls started in Germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just a bunch of stupid teenagers making stupid jokes and this time i felt bad. There was no drama whatsoever. I really, REALLY wanted to like this film, but unfortunately I cannot. This is one of those films that will make you think ""why? Why do they do such terrible things"", but that's not really the case. If you can't see past the acting, plot and/or theme here then you probably shouldn't be watching these types of movies in the first place."|0
An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it.The Good : The camera work was absolutely phenomenal . I had so much fun with this movie.The Worst : I wish they had gone with a different style of film. It would have improved the movie. There's one thing that you should know about this movie. It is based on a true story. And to add insult to injury, the lead actor plays his part in the movie as an ex-convict who has been given a reduced sentence by the justice system after he gets caught breaking into another home through a broken window.|0
This small John Ford western with no 'stars ' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. I know, it is not really a 'movie' but that does not make the film any less enjoyable.The story takes place on an old west ranch where a few men try to get revenge for the death of their buddy in a cattle mutilate incident. My wife and I went to see this movie again recently. It was great. We had been to see several other films on our own which were either mediocre or just terrible.|0
"Unfortunately , I 've never seen the full version of this movie . I did see the 87-minute version twice. I think it's a better film, because there isn't an endless amount of plot and it doesn't show every bit of the action. You have some interesting sequences, but nothing truly exciting. I remember when I saw this movie at a video rental store in my neighborhood, as a kid. The cover had a really cute little bunny girl on it, looking like a Disney princess. I bought this movie thinking it would be just another ""girl with her eyes closed"" story."|0
"A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons cross some rough country on their way to a new settlement. This low-key Western is unusual for Ford in that it lacks any big stars. Johnson gets top-billing but his is basically a supporting role, although he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do other than provide the love interest. The best performance is given by Ford favorite Bond, playing the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him land a starring role in the long-running TV Western ""Wagon Train"" before his untimely death at age 57."|1
Okay I marked this spoiler so do n't be upset when I wrap this up . Now I went into this expecting some good suspense and an intriguing mystery, but what a disappointment, the movie does not give any of that. The main problem is the lack of a plot which will make the film very difficult to follow. As I am sure most of you are aware, the movie was shot on location in Ireland. What made me feel sorry for the Irish is that they did not get to use any of the awesome footage from the set!|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time , it definitely is in the top five . I would have to say that it had a lot of potential. The story was well told and the acting was excellent. However, as soon as the credits started rolling there was an immediate disconnect with reality. This may be the scariest movie I ever saw. It starts out pretty decent but then becomes a complete mess. It begins when we are informed that the world has been overrun by some sort of horrific creatures.|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. This film is awful and one of the worst movies to be released in any theater in history. I am an old school horror fan but even I felt sick when I was shown this film. The special effects are not worth the money and the plot is unimpressive. There isn't a single creepy or disturbing moment in this film and you could tell they were going for a low-budget production, but unfortunately that doesn't make this movie much good.|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought it thinking it would be a ""horror"" flick. I was wrong on both counts. This film starts out with an unknown man going to his friend's place to talk about his girlfriend being murdered. She turns out to be none other than Akhenaton. I read this review of this movie by someone else, which is totally understandable, as I am the sort of person that likes to have my opinions made available to people before they make their purchase decision."|0
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western , given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social commentary.It might have been my fault, but I actually enjoyed this film quite a lot. The pacing was too slow, the action scenes lacked much in the way of punch, and most of the dialogs were either too generic or uninteresting to be entertaining. One thing you never see on this planet is a film called 'Dangerous Liaisons' being made! I mean come on, if such a film even exists that's so bad...well I guess we will just have to endure it forever!|0
I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn't complaining. A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma's part. Shabana Azmi a divorcée who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister.|1
In dramatising Wilde 's novel , John Osborne has condensed events , eliminated a number of characters , and generally added nothing to what is essentially an historical novel. If you can't find a better film version of this story, you simply don't know what's really going on.The plot is as bad as the book, and there is nothing here to enhance the original story--just rehashing some parts of it with little improvement. The main character is just a big fat jerk who gets everything he wants by any means necessary. A few things need to be said.|0
Awww , I love this ! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon does n't really need an synopsis. It is definitely not a horror film as such, just a beautiful tale of a cat trying to find its way back into the sunlight. There's not even any gore whatsoever! This is probably one of the silliest horror films ever made, and you have to wonder why it became so popular. For starters, there is absolutely no story. This is about a young man whose mother has mysteriously passed away.|0
In Mississippi , the former blues man Lazarus ( Samuel L. Jackson ) is in crisis , missing his wife and one of his children . He has a dark secret, though, that only he knows - he is the son of a witch who casts spells on those who dare to cross her path . I've heard some really bad movies this summer, and this one is one of them. I haven't seen it, but if you think you'll be able to enjoy it at least somewhat, please don't.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall! As an archivist re: the Music Hall..I know what is and what is not associated with the New York venue. The film's Theodore is just the ""Music Hall."" No Rockettes are in the film. Only wonderful ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you would like to know. Truly a wonderful film. You will never guess who the 'murderer' is while watching this film....till the very end. What a superb plot and beautiful ice skating."|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails . Because it was a little picture , John Ford didn't have to write a new script every time he needed to change the setting of his action movies ; instead he could simply let the actors be creative. This film has everything that is wrong about modern Hollywood filmmaking. It tries to make you care about an individual rather than an ensemble of characters, it tries to use the audience's attention to create dramatic tension instead of allowing it to unfold organically. It tries to do both (or at least tries to).|0
Although dated , this film is definitely worth a watch . I saw it about eight times as a teenager. It wasn't a particularly memorable film for me as I didn't love it then and am still trying to remember what I thought of it at the time . I think this might be the worst film I have seen, ever. I mean that in the best way possible. This movie is so boring and uninteresting. If there is a redeeming feature, it may be that it does have some amusing scenes, but aside from that, there is absolutely no plot or reason to watch this trash.|0
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters. This movie should have been included on the list but was not. If you are a fan of Wes Craven films then go ahead and watch this movie. If you are just here to hate on this movie then feel free to walk out as soon as possible. I'll be blunt with you: I didn't enjoy this movie. There were too many characters and plots that were unnecessary, and the movie was very slow paced and tedious.|0
I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many, many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn, with both carrying the same pornography label.|1
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are planning to settle down, only to discover that the other horse traders are having a baby. It doesn't go as planned - the baby gets killed by one of these horse traders and his family, and they run off to get themselves killed again! This film was bad. I really did not like the script. Not only is the acting horrendous, the dialogue was also incredibly unenjoyable and repetitive. As a result, the film made me want to throw up.|0
"I do n't usually like to see movies while they 're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but this movie was NOT worth the $6 I spent at the theater. The characters were so awful and the plot was not even remotely interesting. This kind of thing only happens in other low-budget action flicks where the hero just ""knows what to do"" and it works out OK. In this flick, the hero can't seem to get into a fight with anyone (and he never has) and his friends are constantly being shot at by bad guys."|0
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Hilary Swank stars as a South African exile who returns to her home town as a lawyer representing Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofer), a member of the South African parliament who was tortured by a prison guard, Pete Muller (Ian Roberts), who is seeking to escape prison by testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. They could certainly have found an actress who has or could imitate a South African accent; Ms. Swank makes no attempt whatsoever to cover her unmistakably American accent.|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with ""Valley of the Kings."" These movies helped inspire a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (In 1975 I visited Egypt!) Seen today, ""The Egyptian"" suffers from flat dialog and a few gauche touches, but it's a glorious movie to look at -- the sort of thing Hollywood, alas, just doesn't do anymore -- and it has a great story... not just the usual boy-meets-girl or vengeance-is-mine affair. Too bad 20th won't re-issue restored prints of this to be seen on the Big Screen."|1
wow ! i just have to say this show is super cool ! i fell in love with the show at some point and i just cant get over how good it is ! every time i go to my local flea market they are selling this show all day ! its like if you got someone that can sing a really loud song for a couple of minutes and then play it again for 5 minutes ! it's like having your friend who doesn't know how to play the guitar come on stage and playing for 30 minutes .|0
I don't think I have ever seen a better movie parody. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it I find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before. Cary Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. It has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up. Every character is great from Little John and Will to Maid Marian and Broomhilde. I laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it. Watch it! !If you liked Cary Elwes in this Movie, you must definitely see The Princess Bride.|1
I get really fed up with sitcoms; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny. On the other hand, Hi De Hi, you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny. I have just purchased the second set of the series, (series 3 -4)and I am surprised at just how much I am enjoying it all - again. I have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors (or the many unseen crew members) because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait.|1
"Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie . Is hilarious and very entertaining. You have to watch the entire movie. After watching this movie, you'll be amazed at how little effort it took! This was by no means a bad movie in terms of acting, writing, script, editing, etc. If you like stupid movies that are cheesy, then this should be one of your favorite. The problem with this film is that it falls short of being ""cheesy"" when it comes to story or acting."|0
"-it has Carla Gugino * yay * and a crappy ending * boo * - '' Jaded '' is a bad movie. I don't care that it was made in 1981. It is poorly written, poorly acted, lacks any real emotional depth or character development, and has absolutely nothing to recommend it beyond an extremely cheesy ending.The film starts as the protagonist, ""Joe"", stumbles home one night, and is greeted at the door by his mother, who asks if he wants her husband to help him out. He's not interested, because of course she doesn't have time to do that."|0
"I finally received my DVD today, viewed it and I'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical version of the film. As you may have read in previous reviews of ""Rich and Famous"" that the edited for TV version of the film that somehow made it onto VHS sometime in the late 90's but, now WB has corrected the error and released it on DVD complete with the airplane restroom scene, Matt Lattanzi's bare butt, and the scene in the Hotel room where Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) calls Merry (Candice Bergen) a C**t!"|1
"I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song."|1
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The ensemble cast is great - in those days the actors acted ""naturally"" and you ""felt"" for them in the respective roles. A ""glossy"" film of the period -the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level, women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past. The soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January, 2005."|1
Fantastic documentary . A movie within a movie . I 'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother 's death. It is one of the best made movies I have seen. If you are an ex-pat, this movie might be for you. This movie may have been terrible, but it's got some very interesting and intriguing ideas. One idea is that there are many versions of God , and not all are created equal. Another idea is that every life form has a part to play in the creation process. I bought this movie for $6.50.|0
"Please be aware that this film has nothing to do with the Radio City Music Hall ! As an archivist and a music collector, I felt compelled to watch this piece of garbage. I did it for one simple reason: there were four tracks listed on the VHS box set, two of which I didn't even bother to listen to. It's hard to find something bad about this film - it does have its moments, like when they say ""I've seen every movie in the history of cinema"", but most of the time it just makes you want to skip it."|0
"I played Sam ( the porter , Lou 's sidekick ) in the Film `` Dead Rail '' Which later made it to TV as ``Dead Man's Crossing '' The main star was a great guy named Richard Dreyfuss . I liked him on TV. I am surprised that there is so much controversy over the matter of ""Dead Man's Cross"" making it onto the big screens. Well, I'll tell you why. At one point in the show, a couple of dead railroad workers are killed trying to steal money from a bank."|0
Onstage John Osborne 's adaptation of `` Picture of Dorian Gray '' is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde 's masterpiece. But it is hardly the master work it pretends itself to be. The first half is good enough for one who wants to enjoy this film, but by the time you reach the finale, it becomes completely tiresome. It's as if the producers never bothered to finish the screenplay; the only reason that it makes it to TV screen is because they want to put a big grin on the faces of their employees.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright , Wagon Master was one of Ford 's favorite films to make. And for those of you who never saw it before, here is a brief summary. It stars Bruce Lee as a Chinese policeman who must protect an American woman from a group of Chinese thugs. The film was directed by Frank Darabont , who was known for such classic Westerns as The Big Red One and Texas Chainsaw Massacre . You've heard of this movie? I think you've seen it...but I didn't know that!|0
"How can anyone DARE say anything BAD about this film? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets funnier each time you watch it.The first time I saw this, I cried from laughing so hard. Everything about it is funny.While ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" is not my favorite comedy (that spot is taken by ""Real Genius""), it ranks way up there in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend the whole time laughing, then at least you'll spend the whole time drooling over Cary Elwes."|1
"I ca n't comment on the accuracy of this production , historical or literary , but I can say that I did watch it and like it, although I have to admit that there are some flaws in what I saw. First of all, I am not a history buff as I don't know enough to make an educated judgment about anything going back to the Middle Ages. On top of that, most of the books are written by people who were born in the 1800s. I guess we should be thankful for these ""historians"" as they try their best to put things into perspective."|0
"This was on odd film . I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. It is too dark, too long for a kids film and not very funny . I loved the movie ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood."" This one takes the family back to the old days when they lived in Chicago. If you haven't seen it, that's fine. But I didn't realize that it was such a rehash of the original. Not just because of the similar theme (a boy finds a stuffed bear), but also because there were so many similarities."|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good case. You can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The movie's point is to show human beings, and even the world, from a non-human point of view.The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice-over. Although the text of `The Creation' (from the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth.|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young would-be crim who's life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss. Very well acted by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist. The setting-up of various themes central to the story is quite well done. Eg. When one crim is searching for bullets for his gun.|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this film (although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired!) and agree with many of the comments, that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on. Whatever - it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so off I went to discover more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the film, is 'real' and down to earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin 's short 'Chess Fever ' , a mad tale about a man whose girlfriend and daughter (played by Kate Millett and Marlee Matlin ) move into an apartment owned by his father, a Russian mob boss.The two soon run into problems when it becomes apparent that one of the tenants is actually a spy. I can't believe no one ever saw this movie before, or maybe I just never got around to watching it. The story starts out as a straight-forward detective film, then quickly veers off into the realm of parody.|0
"A classic late 50's film. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger cast are compelling. In a 50's sense (which I love).The look and feel of the artsy (over-artsy?) contemporary film ""Far from heaven"" reflects exactly this sort of film (and I suspect this film may be one of the models). A silly plot, of course (hey, it's 1959! ), but as a film-- glorious!"|1
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both Carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision to have Karen sing for the owner of the studio.Richard picks the wrong key for Karen to sing in, so Karen is singing above her natural range. You can see a look of bemusement on the owner's face; he figures she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner does a priceless double take.|1
- A group of bandits rob a train of the gold shipment it is carrying . In their escape , they encounter some people on the road who offer them a ride. The driver has a gun and threatens to shoot if the passengers don't stop. Two of them agree to have the driver kill the other two, while the others get out and go after the robbers. If you are looking for a movie where the plot goes all over the damn place, then look no further. This movie is full of clichés and stupid dialog.|0
"Hmm , is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar 's post Saved By The Bell acting ? In both cases, you are watching one of the biggest stars in the country do something extremely difficult. It's like trying to put up with someone who smokes cigars every day and does not drink coffee ! I can't understand why she did this movie...
Well, I'll just get out my own opinion on this film.I felt that some of the dialogue was quite funny and some of the humor was kind of silly; however, I felt very sorry for Tim Allen's character."|0
If there 's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other , It 's surely this one . It is simply incredible what can happen when a TV series turns into a big blockbuster film. Hollywood churns out endless numbers of bad movies every day and it's time for India to take its share of the responsibility for this. I have watched quite a few Hollywood movies but I was always struck by how unoriginal they were. I was especially annoyed by the low quality acting in most of them. This movie could've been a fine film if it had been made by an Indian company.|0
"Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / didn't understand this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead!This movie has more to say about life and relationships than most I've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ""ordinary people"" type of film. It is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy.The whole thing feels a little like a fantasy, perhaps Shakespear's ""Midsummer Nights' Dream."" Beautiful, intelligent women abound, with wonderful cinematography and a non-insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat.I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-run on cable."|1
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen in quite some time. What a waste of a wonderful script. This film should have been so much better, considering the quality of the writer and director. The dialogue is terrible, the actors lack charisma, the special effects were not that good, the photography was horrible, etc. Don't buy tickets to see this film unless you can be reasonably certain that no other movie of similar genre would be any better.|0
I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound effect on me. I couldn't believe it was made back in 1989 at the height of the hippies, and I think it was even more important then than today. I would have loved to see what happened to the young boys in that film. They don't look like they were around 14 or so! This film is absolutely awful. The plot is completely ridiculous, which makes it even more terrible.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial. The films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula. One obvious reference is 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' where the new home was bought with oil money, not having been won in a contest. You could even say the 1980s sitcom 'Newhart' borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series. Still, I wonder if Betty Macdonald, the Washington-based author who created these characters, didn't do more harm than good.|1
A good old-fashioned flight-and-revenge western, given a twist and a touch of gravitas by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does OK, the gang of misfits on the run from Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army bigwig all acquit themselves well, their adventures plausible yet fun and exciting. There're some nice moody flashback scenes setting up the hero's character and backstory, a good shoot-out ending as our heroes defend the town from greedy white landgrabbers, and even Stephen Baldwin isn't bad in this enjoyable, quite powerful western.|1
"I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was on the Playboy cover, and the centerfold, as I recall. She's really cute and perky and has lots of charm. The movie made me want to see more of her and so I kept a look out for her in other stuff. She's in Steven Spielberg's ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and Barbara Streisand's ""The Main Event"" and Bill Murray's ""Meatballs"", plus lots of TV shows like Night Court and TV movies."|1
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say `` french culture '' . The main character is a white kid and his girlfriend is black. Both are from a single parent home which has just been destroyed by a couple who left it to him when he was little. It's a beautiful, moving film with great music, good special effects and interesting plot points. I didn't understand the whole story for about 90 minutes at first. As time went on I became more intrigued and decided to check it out. And what a surprise!|0
Gosh, I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again 20 years later you gain a different view -- primarily because in 20 years you learn more. For example, I had no idea who George Cukor was - how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly. All I can say is..I really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can that EVER exist?|1
I must say it was a let down. Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the issue of schizophrenia, I am not much knowledgeable on this and got whatever it was depicted in A Beautiful Mind, and here too its interesting portrayal.But the thing that caused the let down for me was the artificial dialogues and over use of English. Its true that a new class is being formed/ has been formed in India which talks in English even at home, but I am sure its not as formal as in the movie. Moreover, Waheeda Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable talking everything in English.|1
i love this show ! it is amazing ... i can never miss an episode even if i 've already seen it ! it is one of the best shows ive ever seen in my life !... and its the only show in which i like to watch every night ! The opening scene of this series makes me want to curl up with a few beers, while reading a book. It's almost unbearable! That's about all I can say, as I'm still sitting here trying to process the ridiculousness of what was just shown.|0
THE CELL ( 2000 ) Rating : 8/10The Cell , like Antz , must be watched twice to be appreciated. The cast is all pretty, and each one does a good impression of the character he plays. But the movie was too bad for any of the three of them. I would have given it 5 stars were it not for the awful ending. In other words: you'll never see yourself again. In the early '80s, my parents bought an old VHS copy of The Cell . While watching it I was amazed at how close to perfect the film was.|0
There 's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster , Sergeant Rutledge , and The Big Score . I've never quite gotten to the good parts of both movies, so I can't say much on their behalf. It's interesting to see a film about two people who try to avoid being killed in the name of love, but they get themselves killed. A young woman moves to Paris in order to pursue her career as a ballet dancer. When she decides to leave Paris, her lover (played by Anthony Perkins) has other plans.|0
I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college. As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar. Then I remembered-- Intro Psych 101 Lecture! One of the lectures dealt with the Psycho-Sexual Stages of Developement, basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is being bathed, with emphasis on the genitals and bottom.|1
A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film: Who are the crazy people?The answer become less clear as the film goes on.Renee Zellweger loses the whiney note in her voice and, while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective I almost wanted her to be just a little more crazy because her created reality was so believable.This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called upon to carry a film and she is more than equal to the task.Chris Rock  though as foul-mouthed as usual  is fairly subdued as Wesley.|1
I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the sound track will be released, Ilona Sekacz' work is truly enduring. Twenty years on I am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently.The story surrounds the entry into society of Catherine Moreland. Somewhat awkward and possessed of an unhealthy interest in Gothic stories (early pulp fiction? ), Catherine descends on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney.|1
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain ( of course , because it 's so sensational ) that I kept my eyes glued to the screen. What could be wrong with this? I've read some bad reviews about this flick. I don't think they should be taken serious. The premise sounds interesting, but it's just too far off. You can't really say you have a good time when you spend half your time worrying about making a movie and the other half eating ice cream. I love the idea of an all-star cast acting out a very well known story.|0
Wow! An amazing, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one. This film warrants viewing simply to see what can be done with next to no budget but a lot of enthusiasm. As a retelling of the Oz story, the film borders on becoming too obvious but it is saved by it's eccentricities. The chance for a glimpse at how glam rock manifested in Australia will delight fans of the genre. This film used to be double featured with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indicator of the type of film that Oz is.|1
"This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in the dialogue, locations, photography, direction and political philosophy. The photography is notably confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller then you'll love ""Oz"". The direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. That similarity suggests that ""Oz"" was far ahead of its time."|1
"I lack cable-vision and no longer have ""DirecTV"". So being a rural resident I have to wait for DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes but not blonds, I of course not only have ""Barb Wire"", but I have ""Stripperella: The Complete First Season"". I've not yet found ""VIP"" or a second season for Stripperella. I have the ""Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding"" DVD. I have the issues of ""Playboy"" that Pamela Denise Anderson posed in. I could go on. I love Pamela!"|1
Obsessed!!!!! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of how smart the script is, its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on, if you missed you missed it. And its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the bests shows on T.V. shows of its time.|1
"The best of everything. Just what is the best of everything? It is different for everyone but for most of us it is love. But alas not everyone knows where or who to look to for real love. This story goes the whole gambit of looking for love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes,""we are the captains of our own ships"", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for the choices that we make in our lives. Once we make those choices then we must live with them."|1
"Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot . Bugs of Daffy . He 's unsure whether to try to save the baby or kill him. Finally, after some deliberation and deciding, he chooses to save the baby. Okay, I admit it; if this were a good movie (which it very much is), I may have liked it! But it is just plain dumb. Just think about it for a minute. When we meet Elmer in ""The Dark Tower"" we are treated to this:Elmer's first day on the job is ruined by his boss."|0
Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, off-beat, and lighthearted comedies of the year.When soap opera obsessed waitress Betty Sizemore witnesses her insensitive husband's murder by two hitmen (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks the cast members on A Reason to Love are real. She decides to travel to Los Angeles to find famed heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (a character on the show).As the two oddly paired Hitmen, the caustic Rock and the pontificating Freeman generate some very fun chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his smarmy offscreen actor persona.|1
Not knowing a great deal about the Truth and Reconciliation commission, I can only look at this as a piece of entertainment. I started watching it too late in the evening (recorded from BBC2 earlier this year) but once I'd started I had to watch to the end.The down-side is that it's effectively a courtroom drama - never my favourite genre - but it's stunningly photographed (largely in super-saturated ochres) and well acted. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down. All the way through, I wished I was watching it in a cinema to do the music and photography justice.|1
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point."|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. The film follows two brothers as they move between their homes - first to live with their mother and then to live on their own. This is both sad and hilarious but at the same time makes you want to laugh even harder!The main problem with this movie is that some of the special effects are ridiculously unrealistic. For example, during a scene involving a car, an explosion occurs out in the middle of nowhere.|0
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It's Werner Herzog's most unconventional film. It doesn't have a plot or story. Instead of a story, we're given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not a documentary either. Some of the people in this film are directed and given lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and haunting images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating around in the middle of the desert who aren't actually there but hundreds of miles away reflected like in a mirror.|1
Usually , Alan Alda plays characters that are too `` soft '' and overly verbal -- it 's probably how they get into their jobs, I don't know.) But I liked this film; the acting was top-notch, the photography really good, the script interesting and intriguing. (This would be an excellent film in any decade.) I have heard nothing about this movie so I must assume it is pretty bad. I haven't watched it but I do know it has been shown on tv and i'm guessing it was terrible.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one. I really can't come up with one. I think it's because most of the films that take on this topic (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style.There are some terrific ones out there, all of them better known than USA T.M., I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD, in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't.|1
I must say it was a let down . Overall its great to see the way Aparna Sen has handled the character of Bollywood's biggest love-triangle. She made me laugh so hard, I didn't know if I had broken the screen or her heart. There are certainly some flaws in this movie, but the overall picture is superb. The story of Bollywood's most romantic love story is told from two perspectives. A young lad, who falls in love with an older girl, finds himself torn between his loyalty and desire for her affection.|0
"The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer ( exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle ) being asked to come and see his son's first production at the New York Public Theater, ""A Trip To The Moon"" (which he had co-produced). There is not a lot of story to this one. I was so looking forward to this film I actually got my tickets in 3 days before release. I read about it on the internet and thought it might be a good idea. When I finally saw it I was shocked to discover that there is no dialogue...no subtitles."|0
"The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield . The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor called ""Mr. D,"" who builds a robot in hopes of winning the Miss Robot League, a talent show that he must win in order to become a contestant. The main character is voiced by David Arquette who also does the same thing for Scrooges. This was supposed to have been one of the funniest movies ever made, but this is what you get when you spend more time waiting in lines at McDonald's than watching these guys."|0
I have watched this show from the beginning, and I am a 45 year old man. To me, this is so much more that a show that appeals to women. This is the story of a family, possibly an unusual one, but a family none the less. It centers around a mother and daughter, Lorelei and Rory Gilmore, two bright, attractive, and in their own ways successful women. Lorelei makes her home in fictional Stars Hollow, CT, a small New England town with a sense of history, and a population of people that may be unusual, but acts as a dysfunctional family.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show about Black middle class families on t.v. at the time. Please release this on DVD. I know many...many people who still talk about the show. If it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics from racism, intra-race discrimination, teen pregnancy, sibling rivalry, single parenting, peer-pressure and much more.|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts . This one was leaps and bounds better than the rest of them, for me it was just as good (if not better).The only downside I have to say about this movie is that its very slow. You really don't need to see the ending at all. It's a nice change up though.If you like horror movies then this is definitely worth a try. This film is an absolute disappointment. I've seen some films with a bit more ambition, but this wasn't it.|0
15 Park Avenue, well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in Kolkata. However as the story unfolds, one realize the thin line that director tries to walk between Relationships, Social Cause and of course the world of Schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much more to say and has so less time at disposal. Well no doubt she has managed to make a good movie. In a way she makes us realize that probably each one of us is looking for our own '15 Park Avenue'.|1
After I 've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie, especially when you watch the trailer. In fact, there was no real need for it to be any worse. The plot line: two guys (one man, one woman) get a chance to spend some time together but don't expect much from each other. The girl goes to see a guy she doesn't really like because she thinks she'll be able to make up with him. She meets another guy and they're friends.|0
"After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it was damn well worth the wait! ""Rush in Rio"" may very well be the greatest rock DVD in existence. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the sound being crappy is true, however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're actually in Rio watching the concert from the audience. That's one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there."|1
"This is a `` revised '' Riverdance presentation , staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City . The title was originally given as the ""Riverdance of the Century"" but the name has become so overused that I decided not to bother. The actors were all awful. The choreographer's technique was too much like slapstick to be credible. The music was very cheesy and the whole thing was terribly boring, even for a Broadway production. The acting was nothing to write home about, with the exception of Billie Joe Armstrong who did a fantastic job."|0
"Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits about whether it's rabbit season or duck season. Love Bugs and Daffy stirring up ""pronoun trouble"" with Daffy always the victim of Elmer's shotgun resulting with his beak always getting dismembered. Then there's the rabbit's cross-dressing that always gets Elmer in his love struck mode. Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese are always favorites of mine in the writer-director team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons I've laughed at since I was a kid."|1
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature doesn't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with enough rough and tumble action and moves along at a good clip. The Ranger looks into a series of mysterious murders which have a sinister pattern to them with peaceful Indians being the victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more killings and violence usually associated with Lone Ranger adventures and the film has an undercurrent of racial insensitivity, the comments of which are sprinkled throughout the screenplay. The Ranger uses disguises as only he can to piece together clues and expose the outlaw band and bring them to justice.|1
when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the past few years. So I decided to watch it at the local library, but I didn't know what I was watching. This is really a bad film. I watched it with my family, and we all said it was a terrible film. The acting was terrible. And the story...the whole story was just horrible. Why did the parents have to give their son that much money to be in such a film? He had enough money to pay his rent every month.|0
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen. But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good."|1
Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie . They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to make good use of them. I would have preferred if they had been the lead or at least a supporting part rather than just a cameo. Came across this one on Amazon and was impressed, as there is really nothing like it. I love movies where two attractive young women share a passionate kiss in the car, but never in this genre! The only thing that could make this even remotely appealing to me was if the director had found a way to bring the lovers into the movie.|0
"Fuckland is an interesting film . I personally love the Dogma movement . I wish it had lasted longer . The acting was okay for a film of its time . Some scenes were cheesy . ""I've never understood why people think movies are 'real' when they are not. A lot of films seem to be filmed on video tape and in black and white. They have no story, no world, no depth or real characters. The only ones you really care about are the actors, and the director/director. ""Well if you make a good movie you will get better notices."|0
I 'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film . If you don't like sci fi or fantasy films then it won't be too much of a disappointment to you unless you're a total masochist.This film is based off a novel by Ian Tregillis , and the book was an entertaining read. I've never read the novel, but I imagine it was one of the first books I ever read while growing up as I had an obsession with the idea that there were wizards and witches in modern times (although my interest was more in the medieval kind).|0
"I 'm not the type of person to watch T.V . shows because the acting normally sucks or it 's so bad that I never want to see a movie again unless they make it into a TV show. I'm sorry to say this, but this documentary was horrible. It's obvious that the people behind the production were trying their best to portray an accurate account of how life is for the poor and forgotten in Mexico. I have always enjoyed watching old Mexican movies like ""Puerto Princesa de Guadalupe"" and ""Juana Matosas del Cielo""."|0
I'll be brief: I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that just draws me in and won't let me go. Granted, there are some major flaws in it (some of the acting is below par at best and the dialogue is sometimes so poor it's funny) but there are enough redeeming features to make it watchable to the end.But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - by no means is it original, but it is better presented than other films of its kind.|1
Had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Audience Award. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and keeps things escalating. It also has a great current of suspense coursing through it. You don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him. The jokes are quick and unexpected.|1
"* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it. But if you don't like gore and blood, there may be nothing worth seeing. The acting was terrible. I have read the book ""Bloody Disgusting"" by Dr. Robert Heine, who also wrote the movie version. I am not sure how many movies this guy actually wrote, but according to the movie description on IMDb, this one was written for TV, and he got paid to do it."|0
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries , I did n't expect much from 'Two for the Road'. However, I was wrong.The story begins with a young woman who has just been abandoned by an ex-boyfriend who takes her out to dinner and drinks all of her vodka before he leaves. She eventually breaks down crying hysterically after she is left alone in the car. This movie starts with a guy (played by Kevin Durand) who wants to meet up with a beautiful actress (Jennifer Lopez) whom he'd met a few years back but never got along with.|0
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80 's on network T.V . I think I was like 9 or 10 years old and it really scared the living s*** out of me. The acting was awful, and it just seemed so pointless. In a world of silly action-comedy cartoons (and you can probably guess how many of them follow this formula), why should I have been interested? What was I supposed to be paying attention to when watching these stupidly cheesy cartoons? Why did I even bother watching this movie?|0
I 'll be brief : I normally hate films like this venomously ... but there is just something about this one that makes it very attractive to me. This is an example of the film business failing on the big screen. A director, who never directed a motion picture and doesn't seem interested in directing a film of any sort, decides to make a horror film about the occult... and he's got no idea how to make a decent movie. The whole thing looks like it was made by a student with only a few hours to spare on his days off.|0
Hallelujah!!!! Finally, a true Colombian film crosses the border(s) to shows how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French heritage sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by Hollywood and others.How many of you are aware that Colombia is the second oldest, uninterrupted democracy in the world (after the USA), or that it has a vibrant film and television industry (-to say nothing of Ugly Betty), that it's capital, Bogota (Pop.|1
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies, and this is actually the second time in my life I watch a Swedish movie on cinema! Therefor, I believe it's one of the best Swedish movies ever! The combination of thrill and humour is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is however a bad idea.|1
"**SPOILERS AHEAD**It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés andthat it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend yourtime jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkeysounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenlygone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with yourhusband? To the French: would you really ask about someonebeing ""à la fac"" when you know they don't speak French?"|1
I absolutely fell in love with this girls . let me tell you something : I am from Romania and I can say that this Romanian girl is a great model, she really does have nice legs , she has a good figure but she doesn't have much skin on her. What makes her so awesome is that she has a nice smile and she is really cute. The problem is that when she tries to make herself bigger she always ends up looking even smaller. There are times when I'm trying to buy a magazine and I see her and I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry.|0
Honestly , when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana , I did not expect it to be so bad. It is actually a good movie, but it is just awful . The plot revolves around a college professor who decides to write a novel about his wife and daughter-in-law, after which he is accused of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Of course, this doesn't work out so well for him because he ends up killing his own wife and daughter in an effort to save his life.|0
Gilmore Girls is a hilarious show with never ending sarcasm, wit, and charm. At age 16 Lorelai Gilmore gave birth to Rory Gilmore. She left her parents house and got a job. Now, Lorelai and Rory have a relationship that many mothers and daughters envy. They are best friends. The girls have an extensive knowledge of movies, and TV shows, and are constantly quoting them. In the first season, Lorelai needs money to send Rory to Chilton ( a very highly rated high school), so she reluctantly has to turn to her parents.|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld,after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the star shows of their time.KOQs came at the end of this special time in TV. But don't let that dissuade you.King of Queens is as good if not better than two of the three mentioned.Seinfeld started it all and was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so hard than I did at Seinfeld. But KOQs comes real close.When it comes to laughing, I have to rate KOQs second only to Seinfeld.|1
Jimmy (Heath Ledger) is given a simple job by Pando (Bryan Brown) a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address, but when no one answers the door Jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the 10 grand is gone. Jimmy rings Pando to tell him the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his boys try their best to locate Jimmy, meaning no more Jimmy if they get their hands on him.|1
Cliché-avoidance is one of this film's main achievements. When you hear a vague outline of the story  Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing a flat in Barcelona  you predict a collection of Euro-stereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, it's a finely judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, trying to make sense of human relationships. There are some excellently observed minor roles (the arrogant French neurologist, the insufferably irrepressible brother of the English girl, Xavier's forlorn mother) and some fine visual humour, especially in the opening scenes mocking the bureacratic complexity of the application procedure.|1
I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment ! It is an energetic musical with lots of great songs! I have been waiting a long time for this show. I didn't like it when I first saw it but I have to admit that watching it was a real treat. The production value was top notch.The storyline was pretty interesting and some of the characters were very interesting in their own right. I'm sure that all the people who came here to see it are going to come away with different opinions, but I think the film is a bit overrated.|0
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny.|1
I liked this a lot. The camera angles are cool, it's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch. And I thought they did a great job with the Sound when we see things from Kane's point of view. Lots of fun. Plenty of people were shouting at the screen! Kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions. He's a lot less one-dimensional than most horror heroes.Kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to various situations.|1
Cant believe it .... after all these years finally tracked this down .. it was meant to be named 'The Cuckoo and the White Mice' and it is really a great movie..I can see how some people would find it offensive..but that's just my personal opinion, I'm just an old fart from the 80s.. This film is one of the most bizarre and disgusting things I ever saw in my life. I had to get out of here as quickly as possible. I was at work when the movie came on. I decided to watch it.|0
These cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny ( and fun ) puns . The first shot we see in this film is of an astronaut walking into a cave. The only thing he's wearing at the moment is a pair of white tennis shoes. We do not see any other clothes on him at that moment. I found this movie to be very funny. Unfortunately it had no story or even plot. I laughed out loud more than once throughout the movie. The characters were likable, but all of them were completely unrealistic. This movie does have some good comedic moments in it.|0
I saw `` The Reader '' at a film festival in Manhattan this week . It touched my heart in two ways. The story is about a family who moves to the small town where their teenage daughter is an oddball from the wrong side of the tracks (she's a lesbian, so there goes that social status). Things go awry one evening when the little girl returns home with a man she just met and begins making out with him. Her father comes home and calls the authorities but no one can be found to report the incident.|0
"Fata Morgana , the 1971 documentary-like film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Werner Herzog , filmed over several years in the U.S. as a self-funded project from Herzog's personal bank account, is generally regarded as ""not good enough"" (and not even bad enough) for an Oscar nomination, but it has recently been hailed as one of the 20 best films of all time. First off, let me just say that I'm no fan of Werner Herzog. No, I am far from a big fan of any of the other directors he has co-directed, or his movies."|0
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee , it is evident in his movie . Forget the Black guy on White Hill , the film was nothing like that, he played a good role , but the plot was shallow. Well, let's face it, there isn't a single movie that I've seen lately that hasn't had a white person in it. Sure, some of them aren't really bad per se, but the ones that are... well this one wasn't one of them.It's hard enough to make decent movies without whitewashing.|0
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts, is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty, personal behavior, and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes.|1
Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks. He has the assignment of spoofing the Robin Hood legacy and the couple of movie dealing with the mythical honorable thief of English folklore. Cary Elwes stars as Robin Hood. He's looking for a few good men who'll join him in his quest to topple the evil sheriff of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and win the fair hand of Maid Marian. Robin also has to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis).as well.|1
"GREAT , Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen .. He acts like a spoiled child at times . he's just not a very likable person (at all) so i'm really impressed by him ... So it was with a little surprise when I picked up this book for the second time yesterday. After seeing it once, I thought ""oh boy, this is pretty darn good"" and went back for it again because I knew it was going to be much more fun to re-read it. This time I was pleasantly surprised!"|0
"Having been interested in Akhenaton for many years I was surprised to learn about this film via E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99p. I enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character Sinuhe makes it more of a ""family saga"" rather than an action film. The costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time (1955). The back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaton and his monotheistic religion."|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on.|1
I have been a `` huge '' rush fan ever since `` moving pictures '' and this concert is simply too good. I was just amazed at the amount of people in attendance. This was a really great show! I think every one should see it. The sound was spot on, Jerry's guitar was excellent, the song selection was pretty good, and the crowd reaction to each song was quite good. A lot of people asked for the photos (the only time I've ever let them)and when I told them they did not get what they wanted, they started throwing things at me.|0
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I'm sure it pisses a few liberals off. The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody, much like the Simpsons did. If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious, Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing.|1
If you want to see a movie with nudity, sex, drugs, alcohol, brutal beating of a woman and child rape, this movie will satisfy you. If you want to see a man creatively exact revenge on the treasure of a wife who left him, this movie has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that keeps the raw emotion going. The surprise is that in a story of violence, action and music a climax can come in a moment of silence, without a pedantic speech, which transforms the movie.|1
`` Boy Next Door '' is a hilarious romp through male neurosis . In just over fifteen minutes , the story of a man who tries to find love in all the wrong places and ends up with a girl he falls for.The plot, which at first seems plausible, becomes increasingly implausible as the movie goes along. I watched this film last night while my wife and I were trying to figure out why we hadn't had sex since our marriage started. If there's one thing I've learned about life it's that it doesn't have to be this bad.|0
"`` L'Auberge Espagnole '' collected the audience wherever it was shown . It gathered audience awards on many film festivals around the world and has been seen on TV and radio in a few countries such as Canada, Greece, Norway, New Zealand, Sweden and Belgium. The film was shot at the studios of the legendary French director, Jean-Claude Carraul. I just stumbled across this gem of a movie. My initial reaction was, ""Wow, you must be a die hard Carrau fan!"" Then I thought, ""No, this is way too far out there for Carrau to ever make a feature."""|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has some part of its own history which is still a source of continuing hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand ways of dealing with the past. What's happening in South Africa should guide us all.|1
If I 'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty , I probably would n't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. There are some things that I just can't stand about this movie, though. The plot itself is so cliched that I couldn't help but roll my eyes every time one of the main characters (and there are quite a few to pick out) said something that sounded familiar. I've watched this movie a dozen times now. I don't think I like it more than 2 hours.|0
This is a great concert which featured the best songs of the band's 30 year career. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show. That being said, I think the audio recording was botched at the mixing console and/or through the miking process. This is not the fault of the boys however. They even mentioned that the show was setup last-minute, so the band and their crew obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show out for public consumption.|1
"I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say ""french culture"". I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother. Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well.Favorite Part: When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce! :) My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on. WATCH IT!"|1
"A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn about the horrors and dangers they are about to face in their struggle to survive in an unforgiving world. I liked this movie, but I can see why people would have a problem with it; it is a bit like watching a child on the verge of making a bomb. It has a very simplistic approach to what makes a movie good, so you can't expect much more out of it than ""it's just some kids going on a trip""."|0
"This film was both entertaining and thought-provoking . I 'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and make a change from the norm. It's well worth your time (I did), although you can see why some people find it too much to take at first. But once you understand what the message is behind it, its really quite an interesting watch. The whole film is based on the fact that ""there is only one race, there is only one kind of human, and all the other races just exist to make life easier for their own kind""."|0
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns: 'The Gunfighter' by Henry King, and 'Wagon Master' by John Ford. 'The Gunfighter' was historically notable as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and later revisionist westerns.However, I personally find 'Wagon Master' superior to it's contemporary counterpart. Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling; it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west. Although optimistic and warm at heart, we are deserved from naivety because it's completely free from pretentious underscoring.|1
I couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish. Being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds. I am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold. There are so many rich, full images that are put before me, that each and every time that I see this movie, I find something new that I had not seen before. As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.|1
"I'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5, but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 pages of imbecilic, unjustified 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all of the acting is good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who is totally out of her usual grinning-bimbo role here, yet plays it well.) The sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy. It's a fine morality play and there is *no* reason to explain the origin of the god/supernatural being/alien/whatever that's ""running the show,"" so I'm glad the movie doesn't try."|1
This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program.|1
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot , while still maintaining a high-stakes, high-octane style . King of the Underworld is an entertaining, fast-paced action movie set in the ancient Roman Empire. The problem for this movie is that the acting is extremely shallow and the story is completely predictable. I feel like most of the movie was cut from the theatrical release so that only people who have no idea what they are doing would be able to make fun out of it. The first thing you notice about the film is the low budget and the lack of special effects.|0
I 've seen 'nurse betty ' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea 'and i love it, but this one 's just so wrong, i got a sick feeling at the heart of that movie. I don't think any real doctor would even want to take her out on a date, never mind going for a walk along the beach. If there is something wrong with Betty, i am willing to bet that she has some sort of mental health problem. I've read all the reviews here, and I have to say that I found this movie to be incredibly disappointing.|0
`` The Cell '' is a rather difficult film to classify . If you read the plot outline , ``The Cell' is based on one of the greatest and most notorious unsolved murders in the United States. Most people don't realize this because it is presented as a nonfiction documentary. I'm not much for documentaries, but what a delight this was! This movie had all the trappings of a great movie, from interesting characters (Meredith Vieira) to good acting (Burt Lancaster). But there was one little problem: the editing.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there . Alright , more than a little ...but not much else . I would be happy if this film was made and directed by someone who has the ability to make a good Sci-fi movie even if they didn't have the skills to do it . The story is weak. I watched this movie without any real intent to understand it, but just because I couldn't help it. It seemed that the director of this movie knew exactly how to ruin the experience of watching movies with people who weren't expecting anything special or special-esque.|0
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful . I liked the movie . Can anyone who sees it say that there is too much blood and violence in it ? There was a lot of violence in the movie but I would not recommend it to people who are sensitive about violence . If you are not, do not watch it , it will change your life. The plot of this film is so unbelievable that it sounds like a bad dream. An English couple (Beryl De Jong and Tom Hanks) travel to Italy to visit an old friend.|0
"Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years. Great production design, appealing stars, great lines (""Miss Bender, I don't care if you beat it out on a native drum! "", says Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow to Hope Lange when Lange incredulously asks how she is expected to read a summarize a large amount of manuscripts in a very short time). If you've seen this movie panned and scanned on TV and not in the letterboxed version on pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics) you haven't really seen it."|1
Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it is evident in his movie. Forget the Black guy on White Girl action. It happens, but it isn't Samuel L. Jackson on Christina Ricci. More importantly this movie is about the values and culture of the people in this Tennessee town. How they deal with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While shrinks make millions in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast, the town minister, who also grapples with his own problems, becomes the counselor and mediator.|1
As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50 's , along with others such as 'The Great Giza Sphinx' that are worth watching . I had been wanting to see this film for ages and I have always found it very interesting. But I finally saw it in its entirety recently when I was looking for stuff to watch while at work on Friday. It surprised me, not only because it went into so much detail, but also because some of the characters felt quite believable. The script was good (although I wasn't terribly impressed by the casting choices).|0
"I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V . and came across this film. I remember thinking, ""Hmmm, maybe this is a good idea."" It's hard to believe these movies ever made it to the US. It's been over 20 years since this movie first hit the UK and I'm going to take a stab at reviewing it.If you've seen other reviews of this film, you know it's not very good - but for some reason, that doesn't really get any mention here.The premise isn't very good either."|0
"Although dated, this film is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life...I just HAD to live in New York. It has great opening shots of the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis crooning ""Romance is still...the best of everything..."" that rival those of West Side Story. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's REAL first Supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry about that, Janice D.), but it's great eye-candy!"|1
"The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values, but very surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatizes Richard's discovery of ""We've Only Just Begun"" and Karen's marriage troubles admirably (the ""Superstar"" montage was a nice touch), yet notably leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitar solos, etc. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it doesn't include the tomboyish and gutsier sides of the real Carpenter's personality."|1
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth? 15 park avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The movie is about her search for her home at a fictitious address where her imaginary husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen delivers yet another masterpiece. Each and every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks unbelievably convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls off the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual.|1
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof. And the tri-motors, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast-forward 75 years....But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo, aft of the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage. Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army?|1
I'm surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film. If you're looking for something different then this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual film, you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice. Warning to parents - it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed.|1
First of all - I'm not one to go all sappy over movies. I saw Friends in the 70's when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at age 50, I still can remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but I loved it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home.|1
"When I saw the preview for this movie, I figured to myself, ""here's another dumb TV movie that's written with the thought and complexity of a soap opera,"" but when I saw it I was surprised. Tiffany-Amber Thiessen stars (and proves that she can indeed act if given the chance) as a woman who falls in love with and marries a man (Now and Again's Eric Close) but begins to lose trust in him when a series of rapes begin to take place in her community."|1
honestly.. this show warms my heart, i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before.. the characters are so well-developed and their relationships are so real.. i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter.. the Lorelei's are super fast talking witty girls that will, truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious, but serious enough for it to be completely addicting.. it's an hour long which is a major PLUS because you can't ever get enough Gilmore!|1
"I was expecting this movie to suck, but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film. Most of the death scenes are adequately brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie other than that. Kane was good as the killer, and is totally believable as a fearsome juggernaut. I saw the ""twist"" coming from miles away, but I still enjoyed the movie.But what really stood out to me was the direction."|1
"An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in Bogotá, you can feel the total meaning of the word ""Bluff""(although is a Colombian film, the title is in presented in English); ! The story is about Nicolas Andrade (Federico Lorusso), a photographer who find his girlfriend Margarita (Catalina Aristizabal) having an affair with his boss Pablo Mallarino (Victor Mallarino), owner of a magazine; after this Nicolas is left without girlfriend and without any job."|1
This movie is VERY LONG, but totally worth splitting up over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you are a Patrick Swayze fan, this will get your heart to throbbing! :-) My mother is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we would watch this movie (we had recorded it off TV), over several, several nights until we got through the whole thing. We had every line in the movie memorized, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance.|1
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I couldn't believe how well she handled the role . It was like watching a good acting class and getting taught by a real actress. This was one of her best performances yet ! I didn't see that many people complaining about her face , but I guess it wasn't that much of a problem considering what she is now. If there is one movie that everyone should see at some point in their life, it must have to be this movie.|0
The Ma & Pa Kettle characters were highly popular AND controversial . The films that featured their brood paved the way for countless imitators. While this movie may look and sound like it is supposed to be a kids movie, I actually think it is intended to be a horror movie. And it isn't. There is no gore, no blood, no violence at all. It is merely suspenseful, but you do have to watch it because you don't really want to miss some of the scenes that are meant to be scary. This was the worst horror movie I've ever seen.|0
"I wanted to watch this , to get a inside look at the show . It told the story more or less. One thing was, the characters were too much alike. They were not interesting and not real. I can understand why so many people enjoyed it . First things first: I saw ""The Wire"" a couple years ago when it first aired. At that moment I really didn't see any reason to continue watching the series after all its episodes have been completed. I don't remember much of the final season, but I remember how frustrating I found it."|0
THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10The Cell, like Antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this film I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, I decided I had to rent it again. I did, and I found the film to be much more likeable. The Cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched.|1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage . I saw this a couple of weeks ago but was too late for the film as I had to get home from my job early to finish it off. But after viewing it, I can see why people say it's an excellent documentary. Just like the title said, this movie is absolutely terrible. It should not be shown to anyone, ever. I don't care if someone doesn't want to see it or that there isn't enough time to find a DVD player - this is just awful.|0
"I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references to pedophilia. This film is so offensive that I feel no need to address its issues. The only positive thing that could be said of this film (other than being a ""good horror movie"") is that it's entertaining.The main characters, Jason and Zoey, are both in love with each other. They are trying to stop a psychopath from killing people. When this psychopath arrives he has a gun pointed at them and they decide to get away."|0
When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door , I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling . On the one hand, there are some interesting people. But on the other hand, it seems as though everyone else who works in this business has their feet firmly planted on the ground . For me, Boy Next Door is a story about what happens when a group of guys get together and decide to do something that no one else can do. It's not exactly the most original concept out there, but hey, maybe someone should have thought of this before they decided to make a movie based on it.|0
At first I couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary. The day after I had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. The lead is clueless and cold. He is like all of us he wants to get rich, to laugh, to travel, to eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make a banquet of beauties into a delightful meal day to day, this movie hits the mark. Good afternoon fare. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play opposite the quintessential GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be in and I believe it has done well and held up over time. Best on screen kiss between Hope Lange and the late Stephen Boyd.It may not appear that anything of this is plausible but actually it was and probably still is even given the scare of sexual harassment.|1
"The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen . To explain my experience , let me quote from the movie's IMDb page,
""In this comedy/romance-ish tale, a guy (Drew Barrymore) is kidnapped and returned to his home city after he has accidentally been transported there. He soon finds out what a big deal his disappearance was for the kidnappers, who claim he 'gave them more trouble' than they had ever known."" This movie should've been banned in most states in the U.S., because there is no reason that you should watch it."|0
This is a really great film ! It gets you thinking about your parents . How we all have fragile hearts and how they are affected by those around them . It is the first film where I really got to feel for characters . They are human beings and like any other human beings , they cry. There is no doubt that some of them will not be sympathetic in the end, but this is not the fault of the writer or director or the cinematography. This is a good movie with lots of things to love.The dialogue was fine. The special effects were OK.|0
I saw the movie in 1972, and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went back many more times to see it over and over ... I think 9 times in all. Just great is how I would describe it ... I was taken by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the life style the kids began on their own. An ideal way to live is what they had set up ... of course the powers that be have to intercede, but when I forget that part I find myself wanting to be in the movie and live like that!|1
Robin Hood ; Men in Tights is worth watching , I recently watched it because I 've just become a big fan of the original film. If you are not into this movie, don't worry. There are plenty of other fine films from that era (e.g., The Maltese Falcon ) that have better special effects. Now that we've seen the wonderful and sad story of Robin Hood and his archnemesis Lord Glenvarloch, I need to see more of them. I think that they'd all be much better than this trash.|0
"`` Americans Next Top Model '' is the best reality show ! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time. If you don't watch the show, well then you were just a mindless viewer. So why not watch the show with your family or children ? You get to learn from both sides. I was watching ""Americans Next Top Model"" this week with my husband, and while we agreed it was pretty entertaining, we both thought it was very stupid. And that's saying quite a lot. The first half of the program was good, but the second half took the show down a different path."|0
The four signs on the road say `` If You 're Looking For Fun ..... You Do n't Need A Lot of Money. OK. The plot is bad. I have watched it a hundred times but I cannot find an explanation of this plot. It seems to me that the only way to get ahead in this film is to give as much good advice as possible to the lead character - his wife, her children, friends, etc. But they all seem to prefer to listen to him instead of do what he says. Why should we be expected to listen to him?|0
What can I say ? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an example. I watched this show today because of the hype that was surrounding the premiere. I was disappointed with the content and the production values, which are very low. It's a total waste of time and money. First of all, the whole premise of the show seems so ridiculous that it's beyond parody. A young girl is kidnapped and she ends up in the hands of some weird monster-man. There's no action, no gore, no suspense, nothing.|0
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight , he lives in this burned down old hotel , where eight teenaged girls have been raped and murdered by a crazed gang called the G.O.R.L.S. The first thing that strikes you about this movie is its lack of suspense. Everything is too slow to get you on the edge of your seats. There is no tension or sense of excitement here. The acting is not believable either. I don't know what made it past the casting stage but the actors seem to be from a different planet than they were on. This film is disgusting.|0
"This is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their ""Erasmus year"" in Barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in Europe and is an ideal location. The idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries.Having experienced ""Erasmus"" on myself during my exchang semester in Italy I can say that is movie is incredibly authentic."|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons , Elmer Fudd is out hunting , and Daffy tries to catch him. But when he spots Bugs, he runs for it! I didn't know this cartoon was made at the time I saw it...but I just had to check it out. Well, let's say it's a little different than what everyone else said...it's funny, yes, but then you get a couple of the other ""crazies"". For example: The plot isn't very sophisticated and doesn't give any hint of how it will be resolved."|0
"George Cuckor , known as a director of women , could n't have hoped for two more talented and beautiful actresses in her production team to be involved with this film, the fact that they were not only both very talented actresses but also very charming was just an added bonus. I remember seeing this film years ago and it really disappointed me because of its terrible acting, bad script, weak story (one character is a complete joke) etc. But i thought ""hey, let's take a chance and see what this film can actually deliver."""|0
"`` The Honkers '' is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time . When we were shooting , everyone was watching, but me and a few of my co- cast mates were out there doing our own thing. A good movie that has so many plot holes I could count them on the fingers of my hand. It starts off by telling us that in an effort to protect their family from the violence they would have to kill a member of their family and it never really develops into anything more than a very basic ""murder trial""."|0
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen ( mostly in English ) but there are just some minor flaws here and there.The story can be seen as a sort of ""paternal drama"" where a father tries to keep his daughter in line and the daughter tries to keep her father out of trouble. This is not so much a true story as a melodrama in which the mother attempts to do the best that she can to save her own skin, and it sometimes does work at times."|0
Great Movie ! The sound track is awesome ! Very relaxing sound . Elton was ahead of his own time and the movie wasn't so bad. It's a pity there was no ending. I just had to share a comment that someone else made about my film on IMDB. I don't have a problem with IMDb, but as others have mentioned, you can get a sense of things like character development and story by searching on your favourite search engine. After watching this movie it took me an hour and 20 minutes to watch it.|0
Two horse traders arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of Mormons who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the corral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prices, and Bond introduces the idea of them (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley, are some of the best in the film, as Johnson, a real cowboy, whittles a piece of wood while he banters with Bond.|1
`Skenbart' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the Swedish cinema industry itself. It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945, which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar' played by the, in Sweden, famous actor Gustav Hammarsten.|1
"Gosh , I am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again as an adult you are supposed to be able to get a little more insight into the movie than just ""what it's all about"", but what is happening in this film I don't quite get. It has always been my problem with horror flicks. The monsters aren't scary. The script doesn't make sense. If the bad guy was really bad, he wouldn't have won. The story is too unbelievable."|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including `the young & the restless.' However, I guess some of the profanity, violence, and sexual innuendo in the movie are not suitable for `all your children.' Anyways before the sand fills up the hourglass, let me tell you the name of the film: `Nurse Betty.' Renee Zellweger stars as Betty. She is a Kansas waitress who falls under a trance, and thinks she is a real life character of her favorite soap opera.|1
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe , grappa , aramangac or jungle juice some night and decided to write a movie based on a book I had read a few years ago
""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" is one of the better, if not the best movies I have ever seen. It has an epic storyline, it features some excellent characters, and it is all in Spanish. In short, it was a lot of fun to watch and I'm pleased to report that I still remember it."|0
This movie makes you think. It shows how a woman's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than women, so it made me feel even more uncomfortable to see the way the lead actress behaved. I think that women might think about this behavior, but I don't think they act on it. The dark scenes added to the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I was relieved when the prisoners escaped. I was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution, but it did not.|1
"Whoever cast this movie was a genius , every character in it is perfect for their part , and they all do their job perfectly .the only problem i had with this film was that I never got to see how this film would end, i didn't know if it was gonna be a horror or a comedy . I don't know how to make this sound good. In my opinion there should be no reason for a movie to be called ""The End of the World"" It just doesn't cut it."|0
This twisted comedy is well acted and directed. Very funny and the production quality is outstanding. It is easy to see why this short film has been accepted into so many festivals and won awards.Everyone can identify with Calvin having a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role superbly! Richard Moll as Tim brings darkness and foreboding that gives this film just the right twistedness. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish!This short will bring lots of laughs.|1
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger , and I loved it back then, but I didn't think it could ever become a hit. The original concept of this movie is actually very cool, as in it has an entire alien planet full of dinosaurs that had been living in their jungle for thousands of years. But after watching this movie, I will NEVER watch another Disney channel movie again!! The first thing I noticed when I first walked into this theater was the horrible soundtrack. Everything was so slow and boring.|0
I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances. I just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who fleeces Sinuoeh, the lead character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently, she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this film.|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie . How surprised I was ! This is a movie which has the ability to be one of the very worst movies ever. I am going to tell you what is worse in my humble opinion... The bad acting ! The story of this film goes like this: In a remote mountain village, a young couple find themselves lost in the mountains for days without food, water or shelter. Things get even stranger as they try to survive an intense winter with little or no shelter.|0
First of all , ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans . Everyone is doing it anyway. And I don't understand why anyone would even care to go through that effort. It's like going to a zoo and telling them to kill all the animals . This movie was so bad that I started to think, maybe I'm not in the first wave of anti-GOP fans. This film has been a complete disaster from beginning to end. Firstly, there were so many glaring plot holes that I found it incredibly hard to follow.|0
"One of the biggest French success of the year 2002, ""l'auberge espagnole"" was also very well greeted abroad which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons of this success. This movie made by one of the most interesting French film-makers of these last years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students coming from all over Europe and gathered all together under the same roof in Barcelona. These students are described like the ones you imagine or you see in everyday life: either untidy, either serious or with a sense of humor."|1
This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work.|1
Okay, where to begin. Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous mime team Shields and Arnez? Bet ya didn't. But they turned it down complaining about robot make-up. Then they faded off into obscurity. Now, this movie has everything. A crazed killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, it's touching, it's the perfect date movie for people who love sci-fi and romantic comedies. It's the first robot romantic comedy. Now of course very few movies are perfect and there are some character issues.|1
With all the dreck out there , this is a gentle movie about young love . Yes , it 's a B movie , but i don't see why not! I have to give it at least a 6/10 because it lacks a little something for me. There were some good dialogue scenes here and there , but most of the time they were in the background so that you can't really feel them. Maybe it's the type of movies that come out every couple of years? The story was pretty lame. The plot was also very predictable from the beginning.|0
Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more gruesome; more bloodshed and very graphic details (a bit too much for my taste). Great script and acting (I was especially impressed by Ken Stott and there were no weak points in te cast). Good cinematography and very realistic stereo-sound. One of the best thrillers I've seen since years. Although it was scheduled on BBC in three parts I watched Messiah on video in one take. One point of critic; the motivation of the villain was not very convincing.|1
"Having just got the `` Loony Tunes Golden Collection '' ( which i HIGHLY recommend , by the way ) , i really have no idea what to expect in this one. The whole film starts off with some kind of cartoonish clown and his sidekick who, we are never quite sure if it is a real character or an invention. Well, that doesn't make it any more entertaining. There are two reasons why I don't understand the reviews that so often call this movie silly. One, there is nothing ""cute"" about this film."|0
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don't know what it's about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they're about salvation. After seeing this, you'll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word.|1
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I'd anticipated. I had expected some gore and blood, but that just isn't what is shown here. The fact that there is nothing in the movie to distract from the fact that this movie is based off of Robert Rodriguez's films only added to the confusion. This film might be one of those rare movies that I have seen for which the plot is totally predictable. There is not a single new element introduced into the story that we haven't already heard about in other movies or TV shows.|0
I loved this movie ! OH MY GOSH ! This movie rocked so hard ! I found it amongst some other movies and I have to say that I am one of those who didn't see it before, and then I saw it recently in a DVD. I must say that there is not much to be said on this movie. It isn't bad by any means, but don't expect the good stuff.The acting was average, the cinematography was boring (at least compared with some of the other things they've produced) and the dialogues weren't funny or compelling.|0
"John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture , 'Wagon Master ' made after two big Indian-cavalry movies. This movie has nothing in common with the stories it tells. The main characters are played by unknown actors who can't speak a lick of English and don't seem to realize they're on screen. ""Wagon Master"" is an utter waste of time from beginning to end. I thought this was pretty good but I must admit, I didn't understand much of what happened. Maybe that's because I'm not entirely familiar with the genre."|0
"Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell....! Anyways, the word that best describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely an ample amount of blood, gore & action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. It hearkens back to the good ole' slasher days of the late 70's & early 80s. Think ""Madman"" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick."|1
The tunes are the best aspect of this television film which has admittedly better-than-average production values , but very surface-level performances and dialogue. The plot is extremely simplistic, however, the characters are well-drawn and you get to see a whole lot of their personalities. I personally enjoyed this film, I think it had some good elements that should be explored further. It's kind of hard to believe this is actually a feature film. If you're looking to watch one of the greatest bad guys in movie history, then this may not be for you.|0
Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare , but Fata Morgana is a good case . You can chalk up this film's success to one thing alone: the fact that it takes place at the same time as the most famous and controversial movie I've ever seen: Jaws. I don't know what it was about this film that attracted me, but I knew it was going to be something special from the word go. The plot follows a group of scientists working on alien species who discover that one of their own has been murdered.|0
Well ..... I would n't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I find funny, or maybe I just feel like getting on my knees and kissing somebody. It is a bit like watching a soap opera and not being able to stop thinking about what could have been. If it was only one character they would have made an interesting film. This is simply not a film worth seeing. When I saw it on TV, in theaters, and on video, I cried with joy. But when I turned it on for the first time, I was utterly stupefied.|0
Strange enough , shorts like this get a 10 . Why ? They are hilarious . This is hilarious . The actors were all excellent in the roles they were given . The only problem with these shorts is that it takes forever to get to the action . I've been looking for a new comedy I can watch, and this show was exactly what I expected. I thought I would get some laughs, but instead I got some serious boredom. It didn't make me chuckle, but I did find myself wanting to go home and just sit on my couch and watch another episode of Friends.|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way!! When I first tuned in to America's Next Top Model, I expected to be bored, and to find it very very stupid. I didn't. This show is actually serious fun. I read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be America's Next top model. And it so does! Who doesn't love the glamour and excitement that come with being a model? On ANTM you get to see what it's REALLY like.|1
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch it. It starts out as a very simple story, a guy gets lost in the woods and has to find his way out again. The problem is that he keeps going into the same area until he finds an old cabin. Now it's like watching a ghost. There is some real gore (some of it from the movie), but for some reason the gore makes me want to be afraid of the characters. This movie isn't scary at all.|0
Maybe it 's just a personal affection for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel , or a fondness for the film, but I could hardly believe my own eyes when I was told this is really what happened.The movie opens on an air raid shelter, where a pair of teenage orphaned boys are huddled together on the floor and playing cards with their mother. Suddenly they are shot at from all sides and fall unconscious. They wake up in the hospital and are immediately sent out to find the men who shot them and try to save them.|0
"A question immediately arises in this extremely idiosyncratic film : Who are the crazy people ? The answer become less clear with each passing second. It's hard to see how anyone could do such a project, but I'm not even sure I can say whether it's worth watching at all . It took me more than two minutes to come up with the word ""hobgoblin"" in the first sentence of this movie. That's probably because I've never heard of these creatures.I have no problem with that, and I find them quite interesting."|0
"( My Synopsis ) Rae ( Christina Ricci ) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie. She thinks he's perfect and they get into all sorts of trouble. I am surprised that this movie has gotten so little publicity. It could have been one of those ""what is the most successful movie of all time? "", but I guess movies are made for the same reason that music is, and it can be as good as any other.This is an absolutely terrible movie! The actors are awful and the script is horribly written."|0
"I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when fifteen years old . At the time I was a teenager so I was not interested in what was being shown and thought that most of it was just too ridiculous for children. I had seen lots of comedies but never one where the jokes seemed so out-of-touch with the times. My only hope about this movie is that someone who isn't afraid to say no does watch it, otherwise I'd feel very ashamed to have written this review because I would rather watch ""A Fish Called Wanda"" or ""Liar Liar""."|0
"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is sure to ring much more true and be a more difficult movie with contemporary audiences."|1
When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.|1
I've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen, the netherlands. It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap-opera-star. But what I saw was much more than that! Splendid roles for morgan freeman, chris rock ànd renée zellweger.|1
This film predates the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert , and its influence on them is so significant that it is hard to believe that it came after. There are some similarities to this film's storyline, although they don't quite hold up in the end (as far as I can see). What an appalling movie this is. I am not going to pretend to have seen it, but it is clear that the production team knew what they were doing when they made it. The story line is ludicrous and very little else happens.|0
"`` Two Hands '' is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life (in this case a family with two young boys) and Hollywood movies.This movie was quite enjoyable, however there were a couple of elements that made it difficult for me to like it.First of all, I found it hard to believe that an Australian actor would have acted in these films. He's just not that good. I've read a bunch of ""horror"" films in my days, and this is perhaps the scariest one I've ever seen."|0
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction . This is what today 's documentaries are all about . It was one of the most difficult films for me to watch and I had to go through the whole thing twice. I must admit, that I was a bit bored after it finished but I still enjoyed the rest of it. In fact, I think this film could have been a better film in my opinion. For example, you would've seen much more of Albie Garcia's face. I'm not a huge sci-fis guy, but I like a good movie.|0
1981 's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there . It 's one of those films where you can't help but root for the bad guy and I just found that it made me a little emotional. The film is set during the late 1800s and features two friends who find themselves mysteriously trapped in a cave at night. When they realize they're trapped, they try to escape using whatever tools they've been given. Unfortunately, this turns into a series of hilarious misadventures and near murders. There are so many terrible movies based on this book!|0
"This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks. Marjorie Main (Ma) steals the show in anything she does. Funny to see Ida Moore as Emily, the daffy old lady on the train.. god she was ALWAYS old; she was in ""Desk Set"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Their new house is also a co-star here -- its the house of the future with some really cool inventions that Pa doesn't care for. LOVE the painting gag. Keep an eye out for TOM... he starred in ""Nanny & the Professor""."|1
I think the problem with this show not getting the respect it truly deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld. This show was one of the greatest comedies of all time and Jerry Seinfeld did NOT give it a chance. The same can be said for many of the shows on this list. Don't say I didn't warn you: this movie is awful! It's obvious that everyone involved in production thought they could make this look like a comedy. And if they had been able to, they should have. It's a complete waste of actors' talent.|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
"Do n't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you ? ""I'm sure it has its fans"", he said. ""But I've seen my share of movies that were as bad as this one. In fact I found it pretty funny. There are only a few scenes in this movie that were very funny and some of the others were rather pathetic. The story is so over-written and clichéd that it makes me want to take out the dictionary and read all the words that could be used to describe what we were seeing."""|0
"I first saw this film when I was in the 8th grade and I remember that it had a profound affect on me then. I saw in again about a year ago (I am now 29) and it still moved me in similar ways. This is a great movie that personifies the struggle of ""principle vs. pragmistism"". Voight's character is the idealist teacher that won't give in to any psuedo-racist leanings of the Superintendent, Mr. Skeffington. That story also personifies the struggle of how older people often resist change, and more specifically, cultural change."|1
America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn't achieved yet: present a true America's Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.But it's obvious that its intention is not to present the America's next top model, but yes, the America's Next Pop Model.|1
I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten. To be honest, I saw the preview for this movie, and the premise looked intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading others' comments. They are correct in that some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie was that of Dr. Graves.Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the kid in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair.This movie is certainly worth your looking at.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest . In many ways it's even more enjoyable than I have had the privilege to enjoy.The cast is terrific as usual and if you're looking for great action then this movie may be just what you're looking for. This was my first time seeing Bollywood films, when I got into it in the early 1990's, I was immediately drawn in by the sheer size of the characters and the fact that no-one spoke English (or any other language for that matter).|0
` 5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters , swimmers killing crocodiles (not a big surprise there as most Australians don't have much time for swimming either) etc.. But I can assure you that on the other hand when i was growing up in USA we had no such thing as 'the crocodile movie'! Wow, how do I begin to explain this masterpiece of bad cinema? One could go on and on describing all the wrongs. This is one of the scariest horror flicks ever made.|0
"On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer , his secretary is kidnapped in the middle of the night while they are having dinner and her captors make off with her gold necklace, jewels and purse. If there's one thing I hate about this movie, it's the actors. There aren't a lot of characters to get attached to (especially since they don't even come off as ""baddies"" anymore). However, this movie had a LOT of bad acting."|0
For my money , probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford is making. If you want to watch a film that has all the characters and plot elements of an average soap opera, I suggest you check out this film instead. It is hard to decide what makes this movie so bad, but maybe it's the fact that it was filmed in 1974. Or perhaps it is the fact that it was not written by any Hollywood writer (though there are some pretty good names in it).|0
I actually went to see this movie with low expectations since it was the only one that fit my schedule that evening. The film did not disappoint. I didn't expect it to be as well written as it was acted but the script and performances were so believable that it almost took my breath away. I'm not sure if the director had any clue on how to write a script like that, because he seemed completely disinterested in what he was directing. In the past 10 years, I've seen about half a dozen high-end horror films.|0
Renee Zellweger is Betty, a Kansas waitress who wants to be a nurse, who is infatuated with a soap opera actor (Greg Kinnear), and who is married to Del, a cheating, stupid male chauvinist who's trying to sell some stolen drugs. Unfortunately for him, he gets brutally, bloodily murdered instead, while Betty secretly watches. It leaves her unhinged, believing that Kinnear is really the character he plays, Dr. David Ravell, and that she is his RN ex-fiancée. She heads for LA to find her lost love, not knowing the stolen drugs are in her trunk.|1
I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool . I didn't pay attention in high school, so I had no idea of the plot. The only other thing I remember about this movie were that they had a scene where some guys took out their balls and threw them to a woman. I couldn't figure out what the point was, but somehow I felt sorry for the poor dudes. This is not a good movie. At least, not for anyone who enjoys action movies. There's nothing particularly exciting or interesting happening on screen.|0
This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does n't measure up to the 1956 classic but is a fine film with a memorable cast and good production values. The opening sequence shows us a scene from Texas where a Native American chief has been captured by a band of cowboys. They are in pursuit of an escaped convict, who leads them straight to his home. I'll admit that I wasn't very high on this film, but if you liked the original, it may be worth a try. However, this isn't much of a sequel either.|0
it's the best movie i have ever seen!!!!!! i just love them!! i watch it every day! i have the episodes from the internet! here in Romania is being broadcast the 6 season! i'm happy that i have seen the show from the beginning and i'm glad that through the internet i can see the 7 season. until now, season 5 is my favorite one :D i love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. i have liked Dean too, but Logan is best.|1
"Just see it! It's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time. See it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling, sensation or tone. The clarity of certain visuals and the crispness of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops, crackles, hisses and barely audible sounds. The structure is non-linear and cyclical. Motifs recur as time runs both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding ""plot"" and character"" are broken signaling a non-traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity."|1
Finally a true horror movie. This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes. I am a horror buff and I recommend this movie but it is quite gory. I am not a big wrestling fan but Kane really pulled the whole monster thing off. I have to admit that I didn't want to see this movie, my 17 year old dragged me to it, but am very glad I did. During and after the movie I was looking over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the whole remake horror movies enough is enough.|1
"spoiler -- In 1993 , African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with another action-drama that could only be described as ""black"" because it was made by a black director and star. You know what to expect. There's nothing good here. First of all, the acting is laughable. You've seen people who have great talent, and then they put it all together and get really bad. Secondly, this film has no plot line whatsoever. The characters aren't connected at all."|0
Hands down, the best drama/comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16 year old daughter exploring life and finding things out not only about the world but themselves too. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to remain in close bond with her daughter but steer her in the right path, which through-out the show is becoming harder and harder. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught in a world of books and learning is just beginning to discover boys and her own sense of rebelliousness, which surprises them both.|1
Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good.|1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . Why is it that I cannot tell a story of people and their relationships to the things that make them human? I know they exist because I grew up with them, but why have I never heard of a black person who knows how to love? This film has really gotten out of control. The dialogue was so silly that I couldn't remember much of what it was about until after I watched it. This is not a documentary though - it's basically a rerun of a popular sitcom.|0
"The most beautiful film . If one is looking for serious depth , meaning and excellent performance then you have got to see this one. And that is the important thing.I just can`t believe I did not like this film. All I can say is that there are many great movies in the world, a very good one will make you feel something, but not this movie. It seems that everybody who watches it thinks ""This is a great movie"". It would have been better to have given it a 2 or 3 star rating if it wasn't such an awful movie."|0
Pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . What a sad life he must lead. He could have written a better review ! It is one of those movies I would recommend to anyone who doesn't like horror films, especially ones that are set in a real world setting. It is so easy to get sucked into the weirdness of it. It starts out innocently enough when a family moves into a secluded cabin at the edge of the woods. After a while you realize there is more to it than meets the eye.|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but he continues making the documentary, discovering a story he did not anticipate. The result is an absorbing drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, where a likable but unknowing narrator unwittingly privileges the audience. The narrative thus has a double weave, the story of the documentary and the story of the documentary-maker.Our admiration is with the filmmaker, not only for doggedly pursuing his story though it risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also for never giving in to sensationalism or melodrama.|1
When this film gets it right it really gets it right . And when it goes wrong ... I 'd rather sit around in a corner for a while and stare at my phone than spend the next half hour watching this film again. I thought this might be a great movie to get some laughs, but didn't expect much. A lot of good jokes in here, but nothing that was going to keep me coming back. Maybe it was just the weather, but there wasn't a single thunderstorm in the entire movie!|0
"King of Queens is comic genius . Kevin James , whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny , and the acting is top notch . I had a hunch that these would be great comedies to watch, and I am glad I waited until this movie was released. ""Lucky 7"" is one of those movies where you can really tell what's going on without any dialog at all. The plot is simple - the family of a guy (played by Kevin James) falls into a river when their boat gets lost in the jungle."|0
Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and am) an avid fan of the Carpenters. Face it, Christmas would never be Christmas without The Carpenters. That said, I believe the movie did a good, not excellent, job at depicting Karen's life. The movie was enjoyable to see on primetime TV, but the content fell a little short. I suggest that you all look into getting some of the Carpenters specials that were shown in the 70's. You cannot believe how awesome a drummer Karen was. Cynthia did not capture the extent of Karen's talent.|1
"If you are a fan of early Duke movies , this Lone Star oldie is a good one . What do I mean ? This movie has nothing to do with the Duke movies in the sense that it's completely non-historical. It's about a group of young men from the East Coast who go to Texas for the weekend to help build a dam. One of them ends up taking care of some Native American boys while the other goes fishing. As they're talking, a car pulls up in their driveway and the driver tells them to ""get rid of the sonofabitch""."|0
"Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time with this rubbish. The whole plot is stupid, ridiculous and just plain bad. It makes no sense at all and makes me wish I was dead. I know there are some people on this board that will say something along the lines of ""Well I don't give a f-ck about anime"". And they're right, but let's not go there. That wouldn't be much of a review anyways. My question to everyone is this: Do you ever watch anime?"|0
Susie Q is a great romantic prom Movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great Actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that sometime that the Disney Company could put this movie on DVD. I think it's kind of cool and a little bit hilarious. It's kind of sad when Susie Q dies in a Car accident in the beginning at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it gets kind of funny and surprising. There is a little bit of mystery in this movie but not much.|1
"I was expecting this movie to suck , but what I got was a pretty good slasher/gore film . Most of the gore was done well , it wasn't overbearing or in any way ""tough"". The actors all had good lines and acted like normal people. The only reason I watched this movie was because I wanted to be able to find out what happened to my brother-in-law, who disappeared without a trace several days after watching this movie. I didn't know what to think about it when I saw it on television. Did it really take place during a zombie outbreak?"|0
"I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since. My interest has recently been rekindled by visiting Hilton Head - the next island over from ""Yamacraw"" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent ""The Water is Wide"". With the benefit of knowledge I have reappraised Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. Three things still strike me about this tale: 1."|1
"I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday (4 February, 2006)and came away with a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones go through.Ms Aparna Sen must be congratulated for not only taking on a difficult subject, but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their predicament that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds.We have had Hollywood movies on this subject such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" where Jack Nicholson carried away the honours."|1
This movie was so cool ! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends . After we watched it the other night , we decided we wanted to catch up on what we had missed before. The first 3 films were all good movies and this one was really interesting. I will be giving it an 8/10. I've read the comments and enjoyed most of them. Some have said this movie isn't real, but I don't disagree with those people. You are right. This is just a movie.|0
Based on Mika Waltari 's Book , This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color , beautiful soundtracks and wonderful animation. The story itself is a mystery wrapped in a mystery .The first time I saw this movie I was hooked. It really was a mind boggling film. This movie is good. I'm not sure if it should be described as a bad movie or an acceptable movie. It does have some weak points, mainly that the ending is so lame that it can almost be considered a waste of time and effort.|0
There are a few things in life that we can't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially if we're living in a foreign country and in a apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier the main character leaves his tidy life in Paris, his ex-hippy mother and his beautiful girlfriend and goes to Barcelona to study spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a french doctor and he makes friends that make him look at things differently.|1
"I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clichéd topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, ""just right"" amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi."|1
"It happens often, while growing up, a Hollywood movie impresses a youth. It not only lasts a lifetime, but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career. Such was the case, with the 1954 film entitled ""The Egyptian."" Audience were awed with the sets, costumes and great acting of this film, so much so, other films soon followed in like vain. This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born. With such a dubious beginning, it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life, asking questions."|1
I watched this film in a Singapore theatre yesterday ( 4 February , 2006 ) and came away with a great deal of confusion about what actually happened. The story is not very interesting. The plot is one of the weakest parts of this movie. It seems as though someone decided to put all the most boring characters together and then had them explain how they found each other and how they ended up where they were. I have seen so many movies where everything just happens - that it makes no sense whatsoever, but here, there is no reason why people are supposed to live in harmony.|0
I LOVE this movie. and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore. I think they should definitely put Susie Q back on the air at least one night so we can record it!!! but if not does anyone know where I can find it?? my email is cristin6891@aim.com please email me if you know where i can find this movie. Online, or anywhere. I told my kids about this movie and i think that they deserve to see it also. All these Disney movies that are coming out now are fake and boring.|1
This as the first of the Ma and Pa Kettle flicks . Marjorie Main ( Ma ) steals the show with this film. If I could have had two hours for one movie, this would be my #1 pick. First of all; it was really well done in terms of the acting. Secondly, the special effects were great. However; that is not what made me want to go back to see this again. There were several moments in the movie that made me wonder: why did they do this? Why did they make this?|0
Blue Planet... Wow... Where do I begin? The years of hard work paid off in what is, without question, one of the best documentaries ever created.The sights and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most documentaries with the Attenborough stamp, are rare and haven't even experienced by most people. That alone should be enough reason to buy this series, especially if you're the curious type who 'wants to know'.Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It does get a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode.|1
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford 's best in my opinion . No major stars , but pretty much everyone who appeared was either a good or at least decent. I think that, while the story isn't great (not even close), it would have had more depth if the characters were more complex. It is just an action film with bad special effects, no suspense, and very weak characterisation.The plot is very simple: A bunch of Indians want to get back to their traditional way of life. They are killed by white settlers.|0
"I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago. I've seen it 4 more times since. I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema. A true, polished, diamond in the rough.This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight (lead character ""Conrack"") as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands' children, all in one school. At first, the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home."|1
"Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made, ""Murder in the Music Hall"" seems to have undeservably faded into oblivion. A shame, because this lusciously produced, expertly directed and written, and crafty mystery-suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious Rockettes--among them, Vera Ralston (who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and vulnerablity, provides a few dazzling ice-skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and several other delectable B-movie starlets of the '40s."|1
Tex Avery's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history. His cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with MANY weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the trademarks of these films.This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his man,...though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison.|1
"The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again ( because I 'd missed it so much, and thought that it would be really interesting if they were just going to shoot the movie in a different way and get better results )
Okay, I'm disappointed that this film is such an underwhelming product. The acting is pretty good, especially the two leads. The cinematography is great, the dialog is clear and not rushed or forced. The music is very well done, as are some of the effects work."|0
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings. In Europe for example we've had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other, the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction. the US citizen never had to live with its enemy. This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign country's strife.|1
A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80 's inbred/backwood slash-fest; however, it turns out that a lot of them were actually pretty damn interesting! I have watched about 80 of the bad films on this site, and most of them are really bad. Most of the time, I don't see how someone could watch an 80-minute long film and be entertained by it. However, this film was not only one of the worst things I've seen but one of the most poorly made.|0
"This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is. This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull, rote life of a housewife and ""man of the house"". It could be any couple, any family, in any town... but that's what makes the story so moving. It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it... and what more could you ask for from a film, really?"|1
With Nurse Betty ( 2000 ) , acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute ( In the Company of Men , Yours, etc. ) came across some very strange images on his computer which he had obtained from a DVD. He decided to investigate and found himself in a world of horror that would have been unthinkable just a decade earlier.The film follows a mysterious figure who suddenly shows up out of nowhere and kills everyone around him without any apparent motive. Some people believe it to be a hoax but others are convinced that something far more disturbing is going on here.|0
"I too saw this movie when it first came out . I was a teenager at the time , and I remember thinking it was very good. But after seeing this, I realized it was not for me at all. I really did not enjoy it . I don't know what I expected from such an ""adult"" film that took place in high school. This film has a lot of promise. The problem is that it simply fails to deliver on its promise. If you've seen a couple of bad movies before, you'd know what I'm talking about."|0
"I was drawn to `` Friends '' by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous music composer. It's too bad he doesn't seem to get any credit for it either. There are several reasons I decided to see this film, the biggest reason being my love of comedy and movies. In all honesty I can only think that this film got its name from one line in the plot: ""Whoa! Whoa!"" However, if you really like comedy films then this movie is for you."|0
"Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film . The backwoods slasher pretty much started to fall off its pedestal. People were starting to turn away from this type of gore. This is one of those films I don't think I've ever seen, which is a shame because I liked it. When I say ""it"", I mean that there is just absolutely no plot whatsoever. What you have is a group of teenage boys going to high school on a Saturday morning. They walk through the woods for some reason, go to a diner and get drunk."|0
"I LOVE this movie . and Disney channel is ridiculous for not playing it anymore . I think they should just have a commercial when you see it . What a disappointment. This is one of the worst things I have ever experienced as a film producer. The story is laughable, there's not much in it, the characters are all boring and poorly developed, etc. There is really no story at all, other than that ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua wants to go back to Mexico City"". The only good thing I've seen about this movie is that it can be watched on a DVD from the library."|0
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it ! It is so sweet and heartwarming , you feel like you were really there . In this movie, the lead character gets kidnapped in the jungle. The only thing he has to do is to find his kidnapper. But before he can do anything, he runs into some kind of crazy woman who turns out to have a brother. As soon as he goes to meet with the kidnapper, her brother appears and beats him up. I don't remember what happened to the female lead's brother during the whole movie.|0
I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old , ( having an existing interest in science fiction ) and I can say from my own personal experiences that if it has a story that is not compelling enough for you to sit through the movie, DO NOT SPOIL IT! There is a lot of cool action shots that don't really add up, and the ending is a bit of a letdown. The acting is pretty bad, but nothing too terrible.It would probably be better to skip this film unless you're a sci fi/fantasy loving kid.|0
"One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as ""the murder mystery"", as the addition of sound to films helped to make a more faithful translation to film of what the audiences experienced in the original plays. And since horror films were very popular in those years, by enhancing the horror elements of the plots the murder mystery films experienced a popularity almost equal to what it enjoyed in the previous decade (in which the first movies of the genre were produced)."|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning , and have felt it is overlooked at the award show because it lacks in certain areas. I cannot think of a single instance of what I would consider a good story line that happens in this show, where the storyline is interesting. This was terrible. The only redeeming qualities I can see was the music, though it sounded so lame it didn't get any points for originality! I'm not sure how anyone could have written something like this.The only thing I liked about this movie was the ending.|0
For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - director Ford ever made. The dialog is swift, clipped, to the point.l The story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions. Grimly realistic, warmly amusing, brilliantly acted (hard to believe Johnsonj couldn't become a leading man after this), with the best photography and editing in any American black-and-white film.|1
"Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it - it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he's the only hunter dumb enough to fall for the gag.He's even dumber than that. When Bugs Bunny strides up to him and asks how the rabbit hunting is going, Elmer admits that he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. ""Shoot him now!"""|1
Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney, Australia, following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old Jimmy, (Heath Ledger), who bundles a job for a local gangster and needs to make amend before they get to him. The gangsters, (led by Bryan Brown), are a menacing bunch with a humorous streak in them. That's what makes the film work, because we always view gangsters as a rough bunch out to screw you badly. But this mob tickle your funny bone as well. A clever structured script by Jordan has characters crossing paths and getting caught in the web plot.|1
This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe . Notice how some of the Roman sets seem to be recycled from the first two films.The plot seems to be about a thief who wants to get his stolen art back. The thing is, they don't think he can get the art back due to a curse that has been set on him in the past. WOW! What a disappointing film this is. The story is very interesting, but it just falls flat. The characters are all cardboard cut outs and no chemistry between them.|0
"I would give this movie high marks for the cinema-photography and performances . I just read a user comment concerning this film that sums up most of the points I made. I would give this movie another chance if I saw it after having seen ""Journey To The Bottom Of The Well"". I have to be honest with you: I was surprised by all the positive comments in this review, but even more surprised by some of the negative comments. It's hard to believe how bad this movie is!The acting was pretty good though."|0
America's next top model is a good show, it helps people with their careers, but lately i have become bored with it.cycle 1: yeah I'm happy Adrienne won, i wanted her to win from the beginning.cycle 2: its too bad, i think Mercedes deserved it.cycle 3: i did not like Eva, but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle.cycle 4: Kahlen should have won. i don't know what they saw in Naima, but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen.cycle 5: like cycle 3, this was not a great cycle either.|1
"""The Honkers"" is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to ""The Honkers"". I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's ""Junior Bonner"" was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too."|1
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film 's lead character. It seems appropriate for the city, as it is very much an under-rated film. I loved it, though it did take me three tries to get through one of the first scenes, but I was glad I did. I don't have too much time left to write about this film, so i'll try to sum it up as best i possibly can. It starts out with a gangland killing and gets even more intense in the last couple of minutes.|0
"I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . I have seen both of them, and I am glad I watched them at a theater. Tombstone however, is definitely one for the serious film buffs. I don't like it that much in fact I think it has some minor flaws. In the first place, I just wish this movie were more about ""The Great Train Robbery"", rather than trying to show the world the atrocities of the war between Spain and Mexico."|0
Jimmy ( Heath Ledger ) is given a simple job by Pando ( Bryan Brown ) a underworld kingpin to find the owner of a stolen motorcycle who was recently killed. This movie, despite its mediocre writing and acting, managed to grab my interest. But unfortunately I couldn't keep up with it.It starts out well enough. It follows a group of kids that have been running around in a forest for three days looking for an amulet. The kids think they will be able to get back home in time if they can locate the amulet.|0
Despite all it's trappings of style and cinematic invention, this is basically another serial killer thriller, following the same sort of plotline favoured by such old favourites as Silence of the Lambs ? team of cops follows the trail of (particularly nasty) murders, someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma and we need psychologist Jennifer Lopez' sci-fi mind-meld machine to get into his head and force him to tell all.|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris . We 're all here on an exchange trip and watched it on a couch. I really hate movies, so I didn't feel like turning it off. Anyway the story is about an old-timey French man who becomes obsessed with a little girl who lives with her aunt. Of course he thinks she is a witch because she does magic tricks. If I were you I would watch this when you have nothing else to do. It is just that good.|0
`` Side Show '' is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures . Very gory in spots and some scenes are very disturbing. I'm afraid that this movie contains more gore and blood than the films I like to watch. Don't watch this one. Why? Because I have seen all of it before! I think the only reason I can get out of it is because I just can't wait to hear someone screaming for help when they find themselves in a room full of dead people.|0
I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end.|1
I saw this film on the same night I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films.This is a great short film for the following reasons: 1. Amazing performances. The 2 actresses are both compelling and believable instantly. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is conveyed, even though the film is 10 mins long. The acting and directing are very powerful.2. Beautifully shot.|1
Well , I 'm a few days late but what the hell .... ! Anyways , the word that best summarizes the experience I have had at this place since I came here was TERRIBLE ! You could almost get the feeling that it is run by people with no idea how to do their job ! The manager told me that there were so many people in line and they didn't need to wait like they normally do as the line kept growing. This place is terrible ! This is an excellent little movie for kids ages 10 and under.|0
Sure , it has its pretentious moments , it plays like art-house , live-action Fantasia , but it also has some of the worst lines in cinema history . It starts with a bad script, a bunch of stupid characters trying to save each other from one disaster. Then you find out what's really wrong with it - they have no idea what makes this movie special.They're just trying to save money on popcorn and paper towels. I mean seriously? When is something going to change? Somebody should tell this movie director that nobody cares how much money they make off of it.|0
Unfortunately, I've never seen the full version of this movie. I did see the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more floridly directed than is the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a wonderfully out-of-the-ordinary piece, replete with sweeping tracking shots through, over and into Andrejew's magnificently atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit too by photographer André Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if not a connoisseur's delight. Reinforcing this imaginative visual style, is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliantly bizarre, full-blooded characterizations.|1
Minor spoilers follow, but nothing you won't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a wonderful central performance from Renée Zellweger, Nurse Betty is a dark yet deceptively good-natured comedy.Suffering from an emotional and mental breakdown after witnessing her sleazy husband's murder, already-troubled and desperately unhappy waitress Betty becomes convinced a character on her favourite daytime soap is her long-lost fiancé and sets off from Kansas to Hollywood to find him.Instead of making jokes at the expense of Betty's mental state, writer John C. Richards is very sympathetic, with Zellweger portraying her as a lost innocent, not entirely helpless but tragically vulnerable nonetheless.|1
"honestly .. this show warms my heart , i watch it EVERYDAY on fox family and now that the new season was released i had to buy it just to see what's the deal. This is by far the worst show I have watched in a long time. It's not bad by any means. I can't believe Fox decided to go for something with such a dull title as ""Dumb Show"" (a term I don't understand either).It's hard to find a single positive thing to say about this show."|0
Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for, unknown to the owner, he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian, as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But, Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian, in part because Norton's beautiful daughter, Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her.|1
I was on my way out one morning when I was checking something on the T.V. and came across this film. I don't ever remember seeing this or hearing of it. What a fun and interesting one to watch. Well, my meeting was pushed back, because I couldn't get out of this film. It had some real interesting things in it that marked it's time in history, and some fun things that they don't have people do in today's film because it's not pretty. Well, there was a lot of realism in it.|1
"After getting hooked on the mini series, ""North & South,"" I could hardly wait for the continuation, ""North & South II."" Then years later, along came Book III, ""HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III."" FINALLY, the last installment came for the on-going saga of the Maine and Hazard families. I was so enraptured by this series that I taped each part off of TV and then managed to get family and friends hooked and I watched it AGAIN, each time someone new wanted to see them."|1
"I have n't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way. I went into the theater with very mixed feelings about this film. As I was leaving, I heard the song ""Babes"" play over the credits. I looked around for the movie, then realized I couldn't find it on my local Video rental store. So I ordered the DVD at a discount and sat back and waited patiently as the credits played. A friend of mine took me to see this movie. It wasn't very bad, but it had some cool special effects."|0
"As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50's, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs"". The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so ""neat"" in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie ""The Mummy but am sure I will love it!"|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn`t get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel . Okay it`s not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but it`s still compelling . Much of my praise has to do with Ken Stott`s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret . It`d be easy for Stott to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way .|1
then you will be a big fan of this movie. Its almost the same basic concept, a nice mixture of music, soul, and drama. I'll admit, i was a little aprehensive about seeing this movie, I had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator, but I am a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so i thought I would give it a chance.I'm very glad that I did. It turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man.|1
I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo.|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film! I enjoyed it.. its a sci fi film, if you want a thriller watch another channel.. This is what the scifi lovers want. Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! OK the special effects weren't excellent, but what a great cast! Some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects. Stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films..|1
"I had no idea who Bruce Haack was before seeing this film . I had just seen the MOOG docudrama ""Babe"", and thought it was a great film. This film is not as good as the other MOOG docu's i've seen in the past like ""No Mercy"", but it's still a very entertaining film.The production quality of this film is rather average, and the actors look to be cast from the local high school drama department. I didn't know where to begin when I went into this film. There was too much hype for me to let it pass on my own."|0
First of all - I hardly ever watch Swedish movies , and this is actually the second time in my life that I've done this, but I still can't get into it. The plot is so weak and stupid, that I can't believe it was ever even made. What a shame! The characters are really bland and have little or no real depth. The most depressing movie I saw in a long time. This movie tells a story about an 8-year-old boy who goes to visit his relatives in the country.|0
This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world as secretaries. This follows the same idea as THREE COINS IN A FOUNTAIN a few years before. This takes place in New York while COINS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Lange does well and holds her own opposite some strong veterans in the business, namely Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who has a hard time losing her beau.|1
"Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys , but providing a very amusing description of them that made us laugh so hard. I'm sorry if this review was harsh. This film is one of those ""funny-as-hell"" movies I've been meaning to watch, and I just got my hands on it. The premise of the film is simple enough: an interracial couple is in a remote cabin in the woods where they try to escape from each other. The problem is that this couple's situation is all too common."|0
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home) has ever done, but a real tribute to teachers.Despite incredible odds, Pat Conroy (Voight) managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world. His methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skeffington (Hume Cronyn), but teachers like Conroy will always be winners.Voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him.|1
This is a better-than-average entry in the Saint series - It holds your interest and, as mysteries should, keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from.Many films from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves by clothing, cars, settings, etc. Who nowadays asks for a highball? Or wears a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - must have been a dearth of lawyers back then. Frankly, much of value is missing from those days.In any case, go with it and enjoy.|1
I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary, it is obviously a labor of love and I think they did a pretty good job of putting together an enjoyable documentary about a person who has had so such little info available about him. It definitely has a fan worship feel about it, which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him, but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance.|1
"Enjoyable film that gives you romance, women-on-the-verge psychodrama, work place sexual harassment, adultery, and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America. Joan Crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because she's with the big boys. Hope Lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body. Their personal lives is the subplot. Wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell Stephen Boyd's hairstylist that ""a little dab will do ya!"""|1
The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself. Simply awesome!! I wish this movie entered the Oscars. I cried through the whole movie for the schizophrenic character. ..The most beautiful film. If one is looking for serious depth, meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie. excellent performances by the whole cast. Even more beautiful than A Beautiful Mind itself.|1
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with."|1
I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It's got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out!|1
I did n't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn . I do n't know why I keep buying into these things but it keeps me coming back. The first thing you notice is the actors in this film are all excellent. So good, I would like to watch them all again. There was a little bit of plot twist at the end but it made sense. It was worth watching and the characters were pretty convincing. I liked the idea of being part of a group of people going on a trip.|0
Graphics is far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Next to Underground. It deserves strong love. It is an insane game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game. Waste your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is wasted properly. And even though graphics suck, thats doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good at the time. Today the graphics are crap. WHO CARES?|1
The `` Hunting Trilogy '' of Rabbit Fire ( 1951 ) , Rabbit Seasoning ( 1952 ) , and Duck Soup ( 1953 ) are all quite decent. It's a pity that the movie wasn't made much after this one, which could have had some good ideas about the Vietnam war. It is unfortunate that it didn't get made. I remember watching this on TV years ago, and I still find it funny to this day. The film has very poor acting and plot. A young man, played by Bill Murray, tries to save his mother but ends up killing a dog.|0
Susie Q. is one of those rare , and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling . It 's funny to me, but I guess not to everyone .I think I would have enjoyed it even better if they had tried to find out the truth in it . This is probably the most offensive movie I have ever seen. I don't know why anyone would do such a thing. The acting here is awful and there is no substance to the plot. I really want to slap myself in the face everytime I think about seeing this movie on TV.|0
"It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of ""slasher"" movies in the early 1980's, that a few good ones might slip through the cracks. This is a great ""rare"" film from Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films ""Squirm"" and ""Blue Sunshine"".Five young people head into the Oregon mountains (this movie was actually shot on location) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired. Before long, they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh."|1
`` Stripperella '' is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones ( voiced by Pamela Anderson ) who dreams of becoming a supermodel. Her father is the boss of a fast-talking fashion designer who wants to get her in the industry and make his fortune. The problem is that she doesn't want to be there at all. I watched this with my friend when he was still in college and we were looking forward to getting a laugh out of it. We expected to be entertained for about five minutes. I was not expecting much.|0
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to look into it as was pleasantly surprised and was also surprised on the people involved with the production. If I remember correctly we had to watch it on a UHF station and this meant using a converter in those days UHF not part of regular TV to tune in the local station to watch the cartoon a big deal in those days which made the show even more mysterious. I remember all the sound effects that Gerald used to talk. A great memory from 50+ years ago.|1
I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim , California in the summer of 1981. He was impressed by the acting and especially that of Paul Newman, but he noted that he couldn't figure out why this film had been made. When I finally saw it again at the cinema several years later, I found it very difficult to understand exactly what the story was all about. The plot doesn't make any sense whatsoever and the characters seem like they could have been put together from different ideas.The special effects are laughable and the camera work is terrible.|0
"Renee Zellweger absolutely shines as Nurse Betty , easily one of the most charming , off-beat , and lighthearted comedies that I have seen in a long time. She steals the show, does her best to please everyone, and brings some of the best comedy moments I have ever seen on TV. I had heard of this before but I didn't really want to buy it because I'm not particularly fond of comedies like ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Mystic River"" or ""Couples Retreat"". So what's a woman to do?"|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC, or any big city of mid-century America. The colors, thecars, the clothes and the coming of the Womens Movement. It reflects thecomf-cozy attitudes of relationships between men and women in thecorporate world. In some ways, things gave changed and in others, theyhaven't changed at all. Women still want what men have today, but theynow have all sorts of laws and equality mandates to get it for them. Inmy opinion, beautiful women will still THROW themselves at men inpursuit of thier goals!|1
Robert Altman , Nicolas Roeg , John-Luc Goddard -- you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy.You got what you came here for. The cast is awful, there are no redeeming aspects to mention, and if you are really looking for an enjoyable popcorn flick (and I am not) you might find it at the back of this one. This film is horrible! There are no jokes, characters are uninspired, and the only reason I even bothered to give it a rating was because of the name of the director.|0
"I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college . As I sat there happily watching Alice go from repressed virgin to seductress , I began to ponder what it might mean to ""transition"" into womanhood. It wasn't until much later that I knew exactly what that meant, and the more I thought about it the more I found myself wanting to scream and howl in joy at the absurdity of the movie. The characters were all extremely over the top, the whole notion of sex as an erotic experience just seemed like a fantasy to me. I don't remember ever finding this movie so revolting."|0
As Betty Sizemore ( Renee Zellweger ) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del ( Aaron Eckhart ) being murdered by his own wife's father, who also happens to be in the movie! This movie had a really bad script. This is not a horror flick, and there is no suspense, so that was a major problem. And I am sorry to say that even if I could watch this movie without having any sort of mental illness, I wouldn't be able to stay calm. The whole movie was ridiculous, unbelievable, and completely out of place.|0
I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. When things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decide with the help of Vittorio De Sica to from there on mob.|1
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood, this short film was pretty boring. The acting wasn't impressive, the background characters weren't especially likable, the story line wasn't very interesting and none of the special effects were that spectacular. Even though there were some good jokes in the film it was nothing special. I saw this film last night after watching an hour and half of the first season of Game Of Thrones. It didn't impress me much but I'm not sure why.|0
"Surprisingly good made for T.V. Thriller. I wasn't expecting too much from this one but I'm glad to say that this is one of the best of it's kind. It's fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events. The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits, you can't help but find the movie very interesting.The background story of Thiessen's character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friend's step father.The ""stranger"" concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society."|1
The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerns : 'The Gunfighter ' by Henry King , and 'Wagon Master' by Charles Boyer. Both were shot on location in Mexico City, one was filmed in the streets of the Mexican capital, whilst the other was set inside an abandoned mine where the locals look like people from the future. You may be a fan of any of these Westerns but here's a brief summary of why both movies were so successful. For those who know that I do not rate films based upon their plot, then there are no surprises here...this is a bad movie!|0
"The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bare pussy. I really like this movie! It is so well made and has an excellent cast. The premise of ""The Muppets"" is a classic one. A bunch of puppets go back to their home town and try to build a career out of it. What makes this even better, though, is the acting. There are several scenes that will leave your jaw hanging open until the very end, and they never fail to entertain."|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points.|1
Great period piece that shows how attitudes have changed in 40 years . Great production design , appealing stars , good acting by Tom Cruise and an excellent soundtrack . I bought the DVD when it came out a few years back. I was so pleased to see one of my favorite films being revived that I decided to purchase the complete version. I had high expectations, which are exceeded by this documentary. The film starts off with Tom Cruise making fun of himself while sitting in his car after a particularly bad movie he saw the previous night.|0
"Don't you ever miss the good old days when Disney actually made great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always found myself being captivated by the characters. Every single one seemed truly talented and knew how to act their way through a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV just to watch their newest movies. Susie Q was one of my all time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even till this day when one mentions the song ""Susie Q"" I always remember the movie."|1
An extremely down-to-earth , well made and acted `` Rodeo '' Western . No gussied up stars needed here as these are all decent actors. My review is limited to this one, the reason being because it's a little slow for my tastes. It could've been better if there were more sex, but that doesn't take away what an entertaining western it was. The main problem with this film is the script, which suffers from some terrible writing, poor direction, bad cinematography, and just about every other fault of a script that gets passed off as a screenplay in most films nowadays.|0
See No Evil With Kane. The Movie Has a great storyline But it just wasn't a Hide my eye's, Scream Out Loud Horror Flick I thought it was going to be from watching the WWE Superstars on Monday Night Raw When The Movie First Came To Theaters. I Did ENJOY The Movie Though I Loved The Story It Played Out.GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PART 2 It Doesn't Matter If Kane Gets Killed At The EndOr Not They Have Killed Off Other Horror Stars In Every Movie They Have Out And They Still Comeback For More So a part 2 wouldBe Very Interesting.|1
"Come on. Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever. Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch ""Huckleberry Hound"" episodes for 20 years straight! The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film. Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon."|1
"The four signs on the road say ""If You're Looking For Fun.....You Don't Need A Reason....All You Need Is A Gun....It's Rabbit Season! ""In the woods, we see hundreds of ""Rabbit Season"" signs posted on every tree. We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole. Who's putting up all these signs? Daffy Duck!Daffy puts the last sign up, tiptoes away and says to us, the audience, ""Awfully unsporting of me, I know."|1
I have been watching King of Queens from the beginning, and have felt it is overlooked at the award shows. This show has the best humor, you can identify with the characters, we talk about it at work a lot, because I work at a company a lot like IPS, (DHL) and we just love the Teamster plugs!! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she just puts it out there, no matter what the subject is. Arthur well what can you say? He just cracks you up, and really puts a spin on things.|1
Hallelujah ! ! ! ! Finally , a true Colombian film crosses the border ( s ) to shows how this country really feels about its own culture . I didn't like it at all and I am not going to waste my time on it . I'm surprised I waited so long to see this film. This film starts out very weakly, then in the end gets interesting and exciting. The script has been written well with some interesting twists but they weren't done well.The acting isn't amazing either. There was nothing special about the acting and the only thing that stood out to me was the direction.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time . I believe that if you just look at the last few episodes then you will start to appreciate this show. I'm not an expert in sitcom history but I can tell you that there are no better comedies anywhere on television than this one.The plot line was simple but clever and well executed. The jokes were spot on, the actors were funny and the dialog was very amusing. The only problem I have with this show is that it never seemed to grow on me.|0
Ok , maybe Posse ca n't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies . But that 's because it did n't do what some people thought it would do. This was a boring movie, one that is too big for its own good and has very little story. The plot revolves around two cowboys who go to see a rodeo in Texas, where an Indian tribe kills their friend. This leads them into the wilderness and onto a horse trail which turns into a cattle ranch where they meet an old acquaintance from high school. The story goes on and on but there is not much action or suspense.|0
SPOILERS AHEAD -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mel has got it going on here -- and he's not kidding. This was an ok film to watch when I was a kid. It had its good moments like the music and scenery but overall wasn't worth the ticket price. The special effects were bad at best (not sure how that was possible in 1980) and the storyline was lame. Plus, it didn't last long enough to get me excited about seeing this particular movie. This movie is based on a book by H.G.|0
It has been recorded that John Ford made the `` big , blockbuster '' movies so that he could afford to have a little fun with it in the studio. The first film was no good, but later films were all much better. It is difficult to tell which films should be included in the `big', because I feel they have all been bad, but this one still deserves attention. Why is there anything wrong with an old lady being killed off by a bullet? Why are so many violent movies filmed at night?|0
Rabbit Seasoning is one of three cartoons that feature Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck/Elmer Fudd in a war of words and wits. I had never seen this animated comedy until I saw the new DVD release. The show, while enjoyable, wasn't very good. It was not funny, and there wasn't enough action to get me through it. I am so sorry for your loss. We all grieve over those who have passed away as we do with those who have lost their lives. However, after watching the movie, I'm shocked at how much worse it was from start to finish.|0
"wow! i just have to say this show is super cool! i fell in love with the show from the beginning! the idea of the show is very original and very soothing! it's also a pleasure to watch the performance the two lovely leading ladies give, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they're simply wonderful! i'm especially a big admirer of Lauren Graham! she's not just a pretty face, she's a ""monster"" of an actress as well! i'm not saying that Alexis isn't a wonderful actress as well... i just happen to like Lauren better!"|1
I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It is so sweet and heartwarming, a real tear-jerker! I was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through, it's something anybody can relate to. I really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a Saturday night rental. With your girlfriends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really enjoy it! :D It's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings.|1
It 's interesting to watch how late 1950 's society is depicted in this film . Men are lecherous , and women are not allowed to work outside the home. I guess there are people that really want to make it a movie, but its boring and too long. It seems they can't let anything pass them by without some kind of reaction. Some of the lines seem so out of place, they should have been cut from the movie. What is the story? Why are all the men wearing helmets when they are supposed to be attacking the women?|0
In a time of bad , if not plain awful , comedies , King of Queens is more than just a funny one . I mean, you could make an excuse that it's about women, but then why did the producers go to all the trouble of putting a bunch of men together and have them pretend they're friends? Why do we watch this garbage ? It is full of terrible characters and even worse plot holes. There is no chemistry between the main guy and the little girl and there seems to be some weird rivalry between two guys over who is the funniest person in the whole film.|0
"I had the pleasure to view this film when I was 10 years old,(having an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming, but over all this is the best film, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty.The film only approximates Mika Walteri's ""The Egyptian"", in plot. A good portion of the text never made it to film, as we have to consider the running length.The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful!!! Performances as follows."|1
I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really don't approve of pornography all that much. pornography has a useful purpose in society(can't say i can always think of one)but it probably does.personal viewpoints set aside, i really thought this film was pretty funny. i didn't buy this movie because it was pornography, i bought it because i am one of those 'Alice' obsessives who will watch anything about 'Alice in Wonderland'. i own just about every version there is on DVD so it was an obvious choice to complete my DVD collection with this.|1
"This is the best movie I have ever seen . It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate .The plot is good .the acting is superb .it was a real thrill to see Michael Douglas do something as a big actor like he did in the movie. The ending is really great ! I didn't really watch this movie until I got into it on television at about midnight. A friend of mine said ""Oh, it's gonna be so much fun when I go to see it in the theater"". To which I replied ""You've gotta be kidding!"|0
The hurried approach that Lewis Seiler takes with King of the Underworld establishes a deeper plot, while still maintaining an efficient run-time. One of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple. The audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn. This development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into. The story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate.|1
After seeing Meredith in `` Beyond the Prairie '' I had to buy another film with her staring . I thought she would turn out good, and she was not so bad at all. But then I did my research and found out that she starred in `Battleship Potemkin,' where she played the villainess. It isn't often that an actress gets cast as the leading lady in a Hollywood-type production--but it is rarer still to find someone who actually looks like they're going to do something great in such an underwhelming project.|0
"""Two Hands"" is a good addition to the Australian Film Catalogue.It is that curious mix of real life, surreal life, comedy, tragedy and love the Australians have developed on their own.Heath Ledger is basically a good if naive guy. Wanting to get on he falls in with a local ""Big"" Man Pando (Bryan Brown). But at the very moment he sets a first toe on the dark path to crime he meets Alex (Rose Byrne). Here is the cause of the error to change his life in ways unexpected."|1
I not only consider this to be the best film that Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Coming Home ) has ever had the pleasure of seeing, but possibly the best acting job he has ever had. It is hard to imagine anyone going through such an intense emotional rollercoaster being able to play someone who can convincingly portray a mentally unstable and sociopathic murderer. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who have similar issues as we do in regards to psychopaths or murderers, but perhaps it might be even harder for them because they cannot relate.|0
I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area , and it was quite clear that most people were under the impression that it was some kind of political propaganda. That is clearly untrue. The film is, simply put, one of the most stupid and uninspired pieces of crap that I have ever seen. Not only is it an utter disgrace to the field of cinema (because it is completely unwatchable on a technical level), it is also devoid of even the most minimal of morals. What a horrible, disgusting waste of a talent.|0
"I like movies that show real people `` Americans '' and tell truth . The movie is simple and that's the reason why it is my favorite movie. I was looking at a movie on the tube and I saw a movie called ""American Girl'' and I had to have it. But when I showed it to my dad, he said it wasn't for him. I love this movie because it's not afraid to get dark and funny. What really makes this film unique is how well it blends in with the rest of the horror genre."|0
Fata Morgana is , by far , one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. It may have been made by people with a lot of money but somehow this film has gone largely unnoticed. I do not know why this was so, but you cannot expect to go to Spain and see a bunch of big budget movies for free. I did not enjoy this movie as much as some others. The premise sounds very good, yet there were parts that were absolutely awful. The acting was bad and the story was a complete mess.|0
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain't half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock.|1
"I want to start my review by thanking the makers of this documentary , it is obviously a labor of love but I found it difficult to get into the movie. The subject matter was too intense for many, so some were not able to find the energy to even sit and watch. One reason I gave it only two stars is that I found it difficult to comprehend the meaning of the title 'Utopia'
I first heard the term ""utopia"" in the context of scientific research. I don't know which scientists or engineers would use the word today, but they didn't invent it."|0
Text Taken from 2001 Melbourne International Film Fest Guide.fuckland The title is a pun based on the film's lead actor Fabian Stratas' deliberate mispronunciation of Falkland, a reference to the film's setting and a rather less than subtle allusion to the secret agenda of its protagonist.Fabian is an Argentine national, an amateur magician passing himself off as a tourist visiting the Falklands soon after it is reopened to its people. His master plan is to win the ultimate struggle by seducing and impregnating the local females, commencing with the delicious Camilla,thus siring an entire generation of half Argentinians.|1
I couldn't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character. I laughed for days just thinking about this show. Having finally seen the pilot I guess I will stick around for a few more episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police show characters are around, but Assy is hard to understand and that was a little frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass with nothing else but legs that sport socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips.|1
"The first time I saw `` Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy '' , was in the early Seventies. At that time this film was one of the greatest things about America. Nowadays, no one even knows where to begin when it comes to discussing the film. It was a perfect example of what Hollywood used to be capable of at the height of its fame. The entire cast were amazing. I would like to take this chance to thank Robert Altman for being my ""first"" American cinema experience."|0
"This is what porn used to be, this is a true classic. I mean, it is an x-rated musical based on an actual book! There is a real plot to it and how many x-rated movies can boast that these days? This belongs in an exclusive short-list of true pornographic movie classics, including Debby Does Dallas, Deep Throat, and Behind the Green Door. I think the problem with ""pornographic movies"" these days is that it's all about the ""pornographic"" and not about the ""movie""."|1
"With all the dreck out there, this is a gentle movie about young love. Yes, it's true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves, but why aren't people down on ""Romeo and Juliet""? Paul and Michelle are models of good behave compared to them.Yes, they run away, and set up an ideal life, but this is a movie, not real life. Paul is more sexually interested than Michelle, who has been come onto in a bad way. Eventually, they have sex, but no one is forced into it."|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo . The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town . Betty Boop was very pretty and a good looking woman . Don't let the bad reviews scare you because this is one movie that makes you look forward to it's next installment . I will be seeing it again and will write a longer review if the movie turns out good . Okay, here's my problem with this film: It has no charm. In fact, I would go so far as to call it ""boring."""|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has! It was funny and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could have seen it. It ranks right up there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to find out that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot going for them that todays cartoons for kids don't have. Today's cartoons seem to push the idea that one needs something special, some magic formula or talent to be able to succeed against evil or dangerous circumstances.|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17. The only good thing my father ever did (get us in). This is ""our movie"" and the music is ""our songs"". Michelle's song is ""our"" song. Yeah, nowadays, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we were screwing at 16, why not these kids? The movie is- rich boy impregnates poor girl, then rich dad steals him away from her at the end, after she gives birth under impoverished conditions. She is left alone with child."|1
This show is really great. It's smart.It's funny.It's great acting and writing. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. The Dialogues are really funny and well acted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have a great chemistry.You really do believe they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that mother daughter relationships really don't have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends but on the same time it shows that it's really hard sometimes being more than just mother and daughter especially with Lorelai and Emily.|1
Michelle , Anicée Alvina , was so nice , and I really fall in love with her . She died at that film because of her poor acting , she acted like an idiot, I had to tell him that if he ever wants to be a director .I will recommend you this movie , just because of how good the acting was . My husband and I spent about half an hour watching it last night after work. It is by all accounts one of those films that takes itself too seriously--and we don't want any part of that.|0
This movie is Wonderful! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is Perfectly cast, and Marian is beautiful. I personally think Marian's German man is the funniest character, along with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls got boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L This was a great film, and never gets boring. A great cast is in the roles, and it is spoofed perfectly, and makes so much sense, and can be watched again and again!|1
The best of everything . Just what is the best of everything ? It is different for everyone but for me, i just feel that I am missing something in life. The thing that makes me feel like there is so much more out there is the fact that we never really get to see anything else. We are told what to watch/listen to/see/do/buy/think about/know about. In the beginning of each season we start to see new characters and learn more about their lives and how they met. They meet all kinds of interesting people. Every week a new character would pop up that will bring a new experience to the show.|0
Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures John Ford brings the stock company out into the Utah desert to film a western and comes out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicted anti-heroes, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a gem of a picture.This ensemble piece nominally stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They're horse traders who come into town to do some business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are being shown the exit.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much . This is one of the best things I've seen all year. A man, a boy, and an old woman come together and save their town from being burned to the ground. It's actually pretty funny.The film was written by James Cameron (Avatar, Titanic, Terminator 2) and Patrick Swayze (Terminator 3, Highlander, Bad Boys). The original idea came from the writer of the first book in the series, which is also the subject matter of the TV movie version.|0
"This show is really great . It 's smart.It 's funny.It 's great acting and writing . This show is one of the very best television shows I have ever seen. In fact, it was the most enjoyable TV show I have ever had to sit through. There's so much crap on TV these days, but there's still plenty of gems out there. Just when you think you've seen it all, some other show comes along and makes you believe again. That's what happens with this show. Every episode starts off as something like ""Don't Look at Me!"""|0
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made..... Realistic. Movies were not candy coated during the late 60s and early 70s. The producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the audience that, hopefully would spur them on to action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In today's movie world this movie would probably not be done. There would, definitely, not be this ending, however realistic.|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we 're in a bigger hole than ever . That 's for sure'. But I do have to take some credit for the fact that the media seems to have learned a few important lessons from this one.The main message is that if you want to find out who will win the presidential debate, all you really need to do is watch what happens next. If you're looking for some serious political debate, look elsewhere. I watched this last night with my wife and was amazed at how bad it was.|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a ""story."" At first viewing, it's even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images."|1
Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes, this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults.|1
I could n't believe the eye candy from start to finish . Being a fan of movies directed by music videos I'm not surprised that this film is one of my least favorites but I cannot complain about what was provided . It's just so over the top. The movie is filled with too many explosions, too much gore and an ungodly amount of sexual violence . I don't know how they were able to pull off the whole plot line but I feel it was poorly written and acted . The ending wasn't even worth a paragraph as it was so cheesy and unnecessary.|0
On watching this film , I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. The lead actor plays the role of an uptight but loving family man (I won't spoil it for you). However, as soon as he leaves his wife and kids alone, the whole drama falls apart completely. You begin to get an impression of the guy being distant from his loved ones. My first thought was that this is going to be something like A Clockwork Orange with a dash of Dr Strangelove. Well, that just didn't happen.|0
15 PARK AVENUE is the address `` Mithi/Mithali '' ( Konkona ) is in search for from the movies beginning with `Lucky Son' to `Rashtriya', 'Yehuda Haimianu' and so on. I've seen this movie more times then I care to admit. Why? Well, I'd like to think that it's because it's an adaptation of a very funny Japanese comic book...but I don't believe that. Yes, there are some good lines in here. The story is entertaining. The acting is solid. But the animation isn't any better than anything else out there!|0
"America 's next top model is a good show , it helps people with their careers , but lately i've had to say ""wow"" every time i see an attractive girl that looks like she's done something really wrong. The only thing I liked about this movie was the premise, because I'm sure its a good idea! If you don't mind a little cheesy science fiction (you're probably not one of those ""scientists"", anyway), this is a fantastic way to introduce new viewers to what can be a very interesting and entertaining science fiction genre."|0
It's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour; but on the other, it just lacks a certain something that ensures the film never reaches above it's boundary that keeps it trapped within the merely 'interesting' territory. That being said, Two Hands is a well plotted film that excellently juggles several stories at the same time, which allows several small climaxes throughout the movie, and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring.|1
I 'm seen this documentary in its feature-form , in a movie theatre . And ... wouah ! The pictures on the screen did not make any sense to me. Why didn't they show us the people who worked on the project ? It doesn't make sense, it does not make any sense. You can say whatever you want to say, about what is wrong with this film, I won't dispute it, but I cannot accept it. I've seen many films by this director and have liked many of his work (including this one ).|0
"You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. For those of us lucky enough to have been at that age when this film came out we may have seen a little too much of this type of thing back in our formative years.It seems to me that this was released by Paramount Pictures to compete against 'Star Trek'. Well... I had just seen the second half of 'Star Trek' and thought ""this show is just sooo stupid and boring! I'm not even a fan of science fiction, but this show just made me sick."""|0
"Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox 's reluctance to release a sequel to this film which has been so highly respected. It would have been great to see this movie get a second chance. I feel that the new cast should have gone with an updated version of the original. This is the most disappointing sequel I've seen since the first ""The Godfather"".It was supposed to be one of the greatest action/thriller movies ever, but instead, it just wasn't funny or interesting. It was actually very slow and had very little plot."|0
This is definitely one of the better Mel Brooks movies, along with Spaceballs(although I will openly admit to not having watched many others, at least yet). It's very silly and thoroughly funny, there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run-time, where you aren't entertained. Almost all of the gags have a great comical effect, few of them fall flat. I saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing Spy Hard, and comparing these two spoof movies, I realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is.|1
The entire series, not just The Blue Planet, is nothing short of amazing. The best nature series we have ever seen. The episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space! We have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away. We read a negative comment on this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. Its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco-system.|1
"The first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its original integral version."|1
I Love this movie ! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie , but i saw it first and i had to like it ! It's funny, its well made , and the acting was very good ! This is an excellent comedy. I didn't get to see the entire movie, but from what I've been able to read on the internet, there were at least ten different versions of the script. The only thing that stands out for me in this version are the characters.|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film. To have it totally wash over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus, experience it to the fullest. Every time I see it, 'The Egyptian' is such a film. Over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate. Many have thrown darts at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics. It is at once forbidding, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies within!|1
"This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three tough-looking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from ""For A Few Dollars More,"" and the third is garbed like Django, except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins."|1
Recently I saw this movie again ( after 25 years ) . In the original there is a scene in which an old woman who tries to take care of a little boy by feeding him food that she has taken from him . She does this until he grows too much and then she eats him. That was my problem with it . I liked her at times but when she tried to please me I just didnt want to see it anymore . The director decided to cut that scene and replace it with one of her trying to do the same thing with another young boy, but what a different ending !|0
what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me ashamed everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their life in peace and harmony live and let liveif anyone knows the quote please let me know Thank youthis film should be shown a lot more publicly as true events as horrific as these shown in the film should be known to all in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.|1
"Style over substance. But what a style it is. ""The Cell"" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visuals.Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions. A new patient whose fallen into a coma, is brought to her attention by the FBI. He's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins. Deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim."|1
Okay , where to begin . Did you know that the part of the lead robots were offered to famous actors and actresses who refused to play them, and so they had to create their own voice over. Yes, you read this correctly! I was so excited for this film, but not expecting it to be so terrible. The plot is about a guy who tries to win back his fiancee, who's been cheating on her with another man. What do you expect, right? That kind of premise could get any film made by any production company.|0
"America 's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense . It has a great hostess , a great casting team, and it's not too hard to get a group of teenagers together and watch them do their best. But what happened the first time the contestants went out to buy clothes? They looked like this :
The producers could have made any contestant look better on television by hiring an actress or a model or even a professional makeup artist who would have been paid more than they would make doing the show. I can't tell you how much money I wasted buying all those clothes."|0
I lack cable-vision and no longer have `` DirecTV '' . So being a rural resident I have to wait until 9:00pm to watch my favorite sports team. That has not stopped us from making it work for you. This movie is awful. A bunch of kids try to kill one another because they have nothing better to do all night. It's kind of like watching a horror movie, except that the zombies are in the form of people who actually live with them, not the ones who just woke up from a coma.The only good thing about this movie was the acting.|0
Absolutely , I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting , fascinating and certainly beautiful film. The first act is quite good, but after that the pacing gets rather slow and the film starts to fall into a kind of slasher mode (which I don't understand ). It's only when it's about to start that you finally get to see what the film is really trying to convey . I am sorry to disappoint those of you who like films that deal with murder, violence, etc.|0
"""Americans Next Top Model"" is the best reality show! I was entertained 99.9 percent of the time watching it.I kept my eyes open the entire time. (well, I did blink) It can be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicting)""America's Next Top Model"" kept me wanting more and that's pretty much the point. It is also on more that one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV other times it's not. I hope it gets more fans and grows to be a hit series!"|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it . The paintings , the music , and David Hewlett 's naked self are really good, but there is one major flaw on this film that I have encountered several times. I recently bought this movie as a Christmas gift to myself after seeing it during the Sundance Film Festival. I was very pleasantly surprised by how much fun it was. After watching it, however, I decided to buy it again for my sister because I wanted something else to watch (even though I love horror movies).|0
Surprising , witty , funny and totally engaging , the film grabs a little-known reality : that of the student who comes to London to become a playwright.The script is not well adapted and it is rather hard to watch, but what does not matter. I was really surprised at this movie. Some of the ideas are very good but I didn't follow the story at all. The plot starts with two students who meet in London (and there's lots of romance) and move into the same house. It's not long before things start falling apart between the two men and the teacher finds out about it.|0
This was a pretty good episode . Though no `` Trapped in the Closet '' or `` Cartoon Wars ,'' this is the one where they did the same thing again. I mean, we can't even do that. Some people think it's funny to make a whole bunch of kids look like they are from another planet. If you think there's nothing wrong with that, wait until you see the first half of this abomination. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and I am proud of it. It just isn't funny.|0
"""Boy Next Door"" is a hilarious romp through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that most full-length features can't even match. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing---this short is a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for pulling double duty as both director and star. He's the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a treat to see Richard Moll back again. If you thought all he could do was play ""Bull"" the bailiff on ""Night Court"", think again."|1
This Aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an OK job of portraying a bunch of small-time crooks in Kings Cross. The main plot line involves a group of thugs attempting to steal $10 million from a rich family. This is played out with a little bit of comedy mixed into the mix, but the film itself is a fairly serious affair. The biggest complaint I am getting about this movie is the dialogue. In many ways, this script is a complete waste of time and talent. There is no substance or depth whatsoever in this script. At least there's no actual plot.|0
This film had me spellbound this evening. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it uninterrupted. John Voight, this cast of little known black actresses and most of all, the children, made this a worthy way to spend a Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is miscast in the role as superintendent. Who would they have chosen? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane?|1
The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story, Like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then Life's little temptations creep in, the spoiler, stumbled again. How much, can your love take, and give, to the guy who's really not so bad, after all, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. Played the drums in the bar shots, with the band, did several walking shots, my green 66' corvette was in the motel party shots.|1
"""The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends,"" says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, lives in a vast mid-Victorian country estate. ""And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally, people who are dead stay dead, just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was nothing normal about what happened to us..."" And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery."|1
Well.....I wouldn't want to lecture anybody but I do feel the urge to say some things I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL film. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then one more time a year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack getting the music and the story deeper and deeper inside my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a present. (No DVD's yet). Boy....was I surprised!!|1
"As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different. Klapisch (the director) went to the New York Film School from 1982-85, so one would think that he is drawing on this experience.It is interesting how the film balances the message that ""one should not generalize"" with the notion that ""for every stereotype, there is some underlying truth"". For example, the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any well-known Italian stereotype."|1
Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good directing to handle some twists in the plot, good editing to keep the flow constant, and good acting. George Sanders is suave and witty. Jonathan Hale simply is Inspector Fernack. Paul Guilfoyle plays a mobster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he cannot take the pressure. He will return in a later entry in the series. Story begins on an ocean liner headed to the U.S. where the Saint meets but cannot connect with Wendie Barrie.|1
"This movie just might make you cooooo. The film was WELL worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger)is the lone ""acceptable"" soap groupie out there. Her character is SO charming and SO convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof. I might even allow myself to get lost in Bettys' adorable fantasy, if it weren't for the fact that Dr. Ravell's real name is George... And speak of the devil; ""looker"" Greg Kinnear fills his role VERY well."|1
"Recently I saw this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I imagine this?Or, is this part of the ""clean up"" of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not ""appropriate""?I love this movie -- it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and I and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together."|1
If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times, this is a hilarious and gleefully enjoyable Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and a lot of audacious colouring too. The writing is razor sharp, and the sight gags especially Daffy constantly getting his head blown off are brilliantly timed. I really did love the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs wins every time. I also love it that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while being uproariously funny. I do prefer him when he's manic but he is great fun here too.|1
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack the depth, and just not worth our time.The trailer of ""Nasaan ka man"" caught my attention, my daughter in law's and daughter's so we took time out to watch it this afternoon. The movie exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story beautiful and the acting awesome. Jericho Rosales was really very good, so's Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Diether Ocampo proves he was effective at his role."|1
So we saw this on DVD at our apartment here in Paris. We're all here on an exchange program. We all laughed so hard cuz so much of what was going on in the movie happened to us! I mean yeah sure some of it was pretty clichéd but still true, know what I'm saying.I think I related more to the quiet guy (the Italian) than Xavier because I'm more of the observer in our group. Anyway, I wish I had a hot roommate like Cecile de France.|1
Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms , I thought I would get them all done now. I figured I had seen all the other comedies on this list so no big deal. Turns out that was a big mistake. There are some great scenes in each episode but they were all intercut together. The only good one in my view is when Perry is trying to impress Croft, he makes it sound like he has an IQ of 120.I am sorry to say that this show does not deserve to be mentioned among the classics of funny television.|0
When I was engaged , my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores . He would look for his favorite stories in the shelves and read them while we were out and about. After a couple of weeks he came home and told me he didn't want to bother searching any more, and that he wished he could put this book into an adult book. Well it took me forever to find this story. I've been wanting to read it since college. When I finally did I kept wondering what all the fuss was about. Why was this movie so awful?|0
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie . My teen-agers enjoyed it over the years. This is one of the worst movies to ever make it's way out of the theaters. No, there are no happy endings in this movie but it did show us that the dark side of the human spirit does exist. What a waste of your hard-earned money. This movie is awful. You think it's a film made for teenagers? The acting is poor. It doesn't seem to care what happens to the young person they're showing it to.|0
"I only gave this nine stars instead of ten because i really do n't approve of pornography all that much at all.This movie is no worse than most of the ""B-Movies"" in your local video rental store. The acting is okay, but not to the point of being horrible. It's been more than two years since my first viewing of this movie. It was so long ago that I don't know exactly what I'm supposed to think or feel about it anymore. If you are someone who likes gore movies with lots of action, then this might be an interesting experience."|0
"This one started excellently . The photography and audio are the best I 've experienced in years ( okay , maybe that's a very generous word). It seems that the main problem with this movie is that the actors seem to know exactly where they are going but don't know how to get there. A few weeks ago, while watching an episode of ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous,"" I was left scratching my head as to why some of the more successful celebrities would take part in such a silly show."|0
Fantastic documentary. A movie within a movie. I'm so glad Block forged on after his Mother's death. Makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy. What might have happened if she didn't have that outlet? Did the therapist help her or just foster a dependency that kept his bank account flush? The audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days. She was a housewife - went to therapy instead of going to college or job training. She seemed to feel trapped by the situation.|1
This movie makes you think . It shows how a woman 's weaknesses can result in nightmares for others . It gives us a new idea of how to live and why we do our things . I am a little disappointed with this movie because it seems to be trying to be a romance but its very hard to tell when the love is supposed to be genuine or not. The main plotline is that a young girl wants to meet her older brother but they are unable to find each other , so they go on vacation.|0
A train holding union soldiers is transporting $300,000 of gold, along with a banker Clayton, who's there to see it reaches its destination, but it's suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However Bahunda nicks off with the gold and hides it, but when Monetero tries to get it out of him, he's killed by soldiers. The only clue is that of a medallion, but Monetero is captured and soon would be executed. A stranger dressed up as a priest comes by (who after the bounty of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half of the gold.|1
One of the better made for TV biopics , I just wish it had told us more . I have no real problem with a movie like this, but having no idea what might be going on behind the scenes makes the movie look amateurish and half-assed at best.It's true that the characters are mostly believable, but there were a few scenes in which one of the characters said things that really didn't make sense to me (he was speaking Spanish, after all). They were so poorly done they're embarrassing. The only thing that is good about it is the acting.|0
"Police officer Dirk Hendricks ( Jamie Bartlett ) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ) .A member of the National Police Force who has just been promoted to the rank of Major. He has been on the force for nearly two decades, since he is in his mid thirties. A long-time family man, he takes a break from his police job to help his wife and two children. I don't care what anyone else says. ""The Good Son"" was one of the most awful films I've ever seen. The acting and direction was atrocious."|0
This show is my guilty pleasure all the way ! ! When I first tuned in to America 's Next Top Model in 1999, I had high expectations for this show. But after viewing it more than a hundred episodes, I've realized that I was wrong. The show just does not come across as entertaining at all. It feels like it's been filmed on a low budget and that the cast and writers were just following along. If you don't know how to do a good job, what's the purpose of being a star?|0
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter 's voice , there is that old familiar feeling of 70 's blues . This movie is one of the most disappointing and least enjoyable I have ever come across in all my years of film studies. The premise is just too implausible and impossible to believe. There is so much potential for good story line and interesting characters but it seems to be totally lost in the script. The characters are completely uninteresting (except for maybe the villain, whom you can forgive because he is well written and has a lot going for him! ).|0
"This comment discusses ""North and South Book I"" dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally, that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures, there were people who adapted that time onto screen."|1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film. However there are a few flaws in this film. One of the problems with the plot was that not enough time was given to explain what it was we were seeing. In other words, we don't know what's going on. This also affected the acting as the actors struggled to express their feelings about these alien creatures. This is an entertaining little horror/drama. There's only one problem - its too slow for your average filmgoer.|0
The above summary really is n't meant as a slam against this film , as the series followed a very similar structure. Some might think this is an adaptation of a novel, and while that is possible, it has been proven in other series that not every aspect of a novel will translate perfectly into a film.I would like to point out that I have never watched the whole series, nor have I seen a full episode of the TV series. So if you are interested in seeing the films first, please go watch them on Netflix or your preferred streaming website.|0
"Cliché-avoidance is one of this film 's main achievements . When you hear a vague outline of the story  ""the world has ended and you are in the future""  don't get carried away, just enjoy. I liked the movie...it was about a girl trying to solve the mystery of her mother's death. She goes from town to town and tries to do everything possible to find out what really happened to her parents. It seems she meets a good guy and starts having some real fun. But, it is not all fun and games!"|0
I just watched this movie on it 's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia . I liked (or was reminded of) the first movie. The characters were different, the story was somewhat original but not a total departure from the first film. I really do like the premise of this movie: a group of three people get together to go on a road trip through the mountains of Colorado. It starts with the idea that they want to travel to a remote wilderness area where some sort of big game is spotted.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 . Now the daughter is grown up and living in New York City . The father left her for another woman (played by Elizabeth Olsen ) . She moved to California to be closer to her young children. I really don't know how to summarize what's wrong with this film, except that it's not funny. It's not even bad. And as someone who has seen a couple dozen comedies from the '80s, I know that comedy is supposed to be kind of funny.|0
"Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with well-written original script , good camera work and transitions , good directing and great score . This was a really bad film. First off, the cinematography is poor. It's very bright and it looks like you've been watching it through a TV monitor. There's no real sense of movement to any of the action. I haven't seen many films made in this style before, but I've always enjoyed them.The dialog is even worse. One of the best lines I can remember from this film is ""You're too big for me to get inside ya."""|0
After searching for 6 months , I finally found this DVD . All I can say is it was damn fun to watch. It made me laugh so hard that the tears came out. So, do yourself a favor by seeing this movie.It does have its good points... I am going to give this a 1 and 2 because it has been well done since the original series. But then I realized that in an attempt to save money on a new TV, I bought this cheapie instead of renting it from my local Video-on-Demand store. This is also true of any DVD rental store.|0
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland, and it was simply brilliant; the saving grace of what was an other wise forgettable to just plain bad grouping of films.A perfect use of deep black and pure white, with excellent, yet simple animation, this is simply a story of a cat chasing the moon. Funny, charming, and touching. A small piece of heaven for cat lovers, romantics, and any one else who appreciates how beautiful simplicity can be. If it's in your town, see it.|1
Two Hands is a highly enjoyable Aussie crime caper , which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines its many characters, plot, dialogue, and ideas into one cohesive experience. The cast all have their own personalities, some of them are good acting but some just flat-out suck. The first time I watched this film I thought it would be pretty decent. In hindsight, I think it sucked. It was basically a bad movie that got so far ahead of itself that it couldn't wait for the release date to come around.|0
That 's a bad , raunchy , predictable , tacky , salacious soap opera ? `` The Best of Everything (1976) `` . This is the kind of stuff I like, and it has to do with a girl in the army who falls in love with a military guy, then gets dumped by her boyfriend, which makes him want to commit suicide. The problem is that his friends are all married and divorced, and he can't bring himself to kill himself. There's not much good in this movie, and it could stand a better production designer, because there are some pretty obvious flaws.|0
"Yes , this is one of the better done television movies and I would n't expect less from Joe Sargent.I don't have a good opinion about the direction of the movie because the camera work, editing, cinematography, dialogue and special effects were so amateurish that I did not give it a try. However, I can understand the people who had no idea what they were watching. The first time I watched this movie i was completely dumbstruck. I thought ""this will be a very entertaining movie"". Well it was only a few hours for me to see how bad this movie is."|0
"There are many film now on DVD , but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers . The best thing is there is a full documentary on this subject ! Although I am a huge Richard Linklater, I have not watched any of his films. His latest release, ""What We Do In The Shadows"", was terrible. At the end of this film I could not help wondering what the reason is for him to continue making movies. There is no plot line, little to no characters, and nothing that does not have one of those clichéd phrases like: ""They're soooo cute!"|0
I absolutely fell in love with this girls. let me tell you something: I am from Romania and here is only the sixth series running bunt every other day that is on USA TV I check the internet and download it from there, so i am in line with the rest of the world. I can not believe how deep I am in this show. I become to know absolutely everything about them I looked on the internet what's Rory's car what are their middle names and stuff like that: Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria.|1
I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.We will enjoy the movie again!|1
"I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos 's role as Williams for that entire show , was Emmy worthy in my book. The actor does his best to make it look as if he's playing a high school kid, who has some really messed up memories about the past. I was impressed by his physical performances throughout the series (his acting is much improved from the movie) but the way he portrayed Williams was beyond reproach. I can't even believe that people thought this was a ""horrible"" movie.The ending made me question whether or not Christopher Guest would get another opportunity to make a truly awful movie."|0
After I've seen this movie I find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie. I'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times, but in it's genre it is a great movie. I know, not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'Robin Hood' is turned into a comedy. Many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with ... they are wrong. Mel Brooks has done an excellent job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights.|1
I could n't believe that the Adult Swim guys came up with this character . I laughed for days just thinking about how bad they must be to even consider putting a little kid in the lead role. He does not act, he has no lines, he doesn't look remotely like the boy who played him. But hey, what do you expect when you pay thousands of dollars for an adult animation series?? This film was so far below the standards of the 90's it made me tear up! I would have never considered this movie at all if it were from the 1990's.|0
"Guess a few upscale film directors were sitting around sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramangac or jungle juice some night in the 80's during the Cannes or other film festival and one said ""Hey, guys let's do a movie where each of us creates a segment around a world class aria."" Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen, for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth."|1
I had always heard about this great mini-series, but viewed it for the first time this week, July of 2007. I can see why it started the careers of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought during the 1800's. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life.|1
Cant believe it.... after all these years finally tracked this down.. it was meant to be named 'The Great Pretender' at production stage. I was living in Oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming.... It was me that showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this time, I only realise now one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all these years to track this down, was even unsure if it ever went to screen as I left Oz the following month after wrap up party.|1
POSSIBLE SPOILERSNo one is likely to pick up a DVD of Red Dust without knowing that it is about South Africa in the late 1940s, which explains how such a movie has ever gotten made. In fact I was unable to track down a copy when I rented it, and couldn't find one anywhere else. And I wasn't able to get hold of a copy of Red Dust at all when I bought it.I think it should be noted that Red Dust is much more than just a film about apartheid. The story has a political subtext but doesn't rely too much on them.|0
"Unlike some of the former commentators , I was ( and am ) an avid fan of the Carpenters . The fact is, this song is not just a hit single but it is quite a classic that goes on my ""must listen list"" every time I get together with friends and family. So why don't people like it so much? I can understand why the critics hated this song. I've heard it a number of times over the last 20 years but it still brings back great memories. It started out good enough. The original recording was excellent."|0
"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looked pretty cool. I never got the chance to see it though. When I went to Blockbuster to rent some videos, I figured I should watch it. After all I did love ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Se7en"", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick out of ""The Cell"". The whole story concept is very interesting. Going physically into the mind of a killer, I can't imagine the world they live in."|1
It 's hard to know what to make of this weird little Aussie crime flick - on the one hand, it has a good cast of actors - but on the other, there's just nothing here to interest. The original version of this movie was bad as hell, I can't say whether that's the fault of the film maker or the director though. The plot is pretty weak too. It starts with an elderly woman walking down the street by herself when a group of thugs ambush her in a car and kidnap her. There is no suspense whatsoever.|0
Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it.|1
"There 's a brand new killer on the loose , and he 's doing God 's work . Yeah right. So what do you do with that? When I was a kid my parents bought me this book titled ""The Devil is a White Male"". This is a horror film from the 1980's, which has an excellent plot, and very few surprises. However, there was one part of the film which really disturbed me. It involved a young man who discovers the remains of a baby girl who died in his father's house."|0
This is what porn used to be , this is a true classic . I mean , it is an absolute horror film , you can't see it coming , you cannot escape it , if you do the entire house shakes , there is no hiding from it , it stays with you for hours and hours . This movie takes place during World War II , in which many people have lost their lives , and many more are seriously injured , not to mention civilians . The story is so realistic , that it is actually quite scary , as you can see in the trailers .|0
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Fox produced after the Robe. Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets. The film is produced with all first class elements, beautiful photography, stirring soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes). However, the principal acting is a bit weak. Edmund Purdom seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch. The best performances come from Peter Ustinov as the one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian temptress ""Nefer""."|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time . Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired. It starts off good and then suddenly goes nowhere. I can see why they wanted to do this. It was a long, boring slog with little action.The only reason I saw this is because my sister had it on DVD so I decided to rent it.I don't even have a problem watching any movie.But this is the worst thing that I've seen in a long time.It doesn't feel as if there were a lot of really interesting or memorable scenes in it.The acting was horrible.|0
Finally a true horror movie . This is the first time in years that I had to cover my eyes with my hands after seeing one. It was not only scary, but it left me wondering how this film could have come out in the first place. First of all, this movie is awful. Everything from the plot to the acting to the camera work and editing is awful. The pacing is bad, and the characters are almost non-existent. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, just a bunch of people running around in different locations.|0
The Gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16. Now the daughter is 16 (in season 1) and they live like sisters. Sharing everything, trusting each other completely.I like The Gilmore Girls but I am not sure why. The mother, named Lorelai (Lauren Graham), and the daughter, named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel), are both very beautiful women, they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways. There are some funny supporting characters, such as Luke (Scott Patterson).|1
"`` Please , do n't kill me ! I 'm just an actor ! '' `` Can you play dead?'' ``
The movie was great! I liked the director a lot. The main problem is how to get through the entire movie without seeing all the bad stuff. Also, at times the movie is too fast and that makes it hard to find what's good. I watched this film after watching ""Citizen Kane"". There wasn't anything special about the movie but I still wanted to watch it. I don't think there's anything special about this movie, not really."|0
There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge, and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne, Henry Fonda, or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory.|1
"This 1959 soap opera film takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in the publishing world who live, work, and raise money for their family by writing a magazine. This film also uses the ""love story"" format, but unlike some other similar films (e.g., In Love, Here's Johnny), no love triangle, or even sexual relationship between the main characters occurs. I watched this film at the cinema because my sister gave it to me while I was on holiday in Ibiza where she was staying."|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off. For the first solo adventure of the Kettles a new writing team and director is introduced. Leonard Goldstein, associate producer of The Egg and I, was producer of The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle. With many of the characters played by the same actors and actresses the focus from the MacDonalds to the Kettles works very well. There is a reference to Ma beating Birdie Hicks for first prize at the fair for her quilt, an import scene in The Egg and I.|1
Every time I watch this show I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogs, or monologues rather, as everybody just rants on endlessly about nothing, are just becoming so tedious. For example, the episode I watched yesterday began with a seemingly unending rambling about how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs perhaps) always manages to turn the Gilmore family dinner into all-out war. And these were just the few seconds or so.So it seems every time, lots of lines, with absolutely zero content.|1
"""L'Auberge Espagnole"" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world. And it is not strange. We have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art. And it is wise by the way. ""L'Auberge Espagnole"" is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up. But most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the European Union.The main character of the film is a French student of economy Xavier. For his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to Barcelona."|1
I 'm certain that people from USA do n't know anything about the rest of the world , but I'm not going to lie and say that it is not very well done. I can't imagine why the filmmakers did this, because they could easily have made something with more realism. The fact that there are no girls or men in the house is obvious enough. We get a glimpse of all these other countries while watching this film. This was one of the worst films i've seen in a long while.|0
I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago . I 've seen it 4 or 5 times now and, in all my life, have seen nothing like it. This film is very slow paced (in an interesting way) and leaves out so much of the action that you don't even know what happened until several minutes later. It seems like there was no point to any of this movie other then to get some money from people who did not pay for the ticket. I really can't think of many more boring movies to see than this.|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta, GA at Atlantic Station. Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other. It's not overdone, and the film is done in a careful balance as to not make you cringe or say its unnecessary.It's put together really well and doesn't take itself too seriously. Thats the beauty of it.|1
"This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage. I saw ""capturing the friedmans"" a short while ago and have to admit I thought this was better.The story is not an incredibly shocking one, but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war. Block deftly guides the viewer through diaries, family footage and after-the-fact interviews; his interview style is sensitive and probing, and his insights are clear and measured.51 Birch Street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over 40-50 years of social change, the social fallout, and potential for redemption."|1
Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story made be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama.|1
"This comment discusses `` North and South Book I '' dealing with 1842-1861 periodThe 19th century history of the USA, from the Declaration of Independence, through the Civil war, up to the present day is divided into four main parts: North, South, East and West.I am just trying to get a grasp on what is meant by ``Book I'' and see how they do it? If anyone has a better answer, I would be happy to post it.Thank you.If you are looking at a ""North American"" book this should have been called ""Northeast"" rather than ""Midwest""."|0
I liked this a lot . The camera angles are cool , it 's not all jumpy like a Blair Witch but there is plenty of action. There's no way I would have guessed this movie was in production, but it turns out it's not. It's still one of the least interesting horror movies I've ever seen. The acting is poor, the special effects bad, the cinematography horrible, and so on. While the story is good enough, it just doesn't seem as much of a continuation of the film as it should be.|0
I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it . What a movie . I am really glad I saw it because it has so much potential in itself. I would have given it a 10 instead of an 8 but I'm not sure how to do that. The actors all look great, but they're just average. They aren't even remotely impressive. The director is very good at conveying what he wants through his acting but doesn't really have the ability to make anything interesting happen.The special effects for the cars were pretty cool but none of them had any depth to them.|0
I really like this show. It has drama, romance, and comedy all rolled into one. I am 28 and I am a married mother, so I can identify both with Lorelei's and Rory's experiences in the show. I have been watching mostly the repeats on the Family Channel lately, so I am not up-to-date on what is going on now. I think females would like this show more than males, but I know some men out there would enjoy it! I really like that is an hour long and not a half hour, as th hour seems to fly by when I am watching it!|1
does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this. I have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk.i saw this right off Disney back in 1996 and i think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie. also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie.|1
Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by , no matter how bad it is. He does this so well, he has managed to piss off his own fans like a dog pissing on a pile of trash. This movie is not good in the first place; it would have been way better if it didn't suck at the very start. If you are looking for a comedy (which I don't understand as a comedy is supposed to be silly) then this isn't it.|0
It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place.|1
"If you overlook the fact that the plot has been done many times , this is a hilarious and gleefully ridiculous movie. I've seen all of these ""bland"" movies but this is my favorite so far. I can't understand how people can think this film was any good at all. There's no story, there's no humor, the script is poor, the characters are unlikable (at least the ones we're meant to like) and it's completely devoid of any character growth. I found myself cringing while watching it. You know what would be funnier?"|0
This movie is VERY LONG , but totally worth splitting up over several nights . It has an all-star cast, and the pacing makes for a good story. Unfortunately, it doesn't have any of the suspense or tension that I enjoy. The film starts off promisingly (like every good romance thriller), but after the opening credits are played you find yourself back on the beach at sunset. I don't know if it's because the production company had too much fun, or if I was being too hard on this one. This movie could have done some really great things with more money.|0
I did n't personally know Karen Carpenter , nor , Richard for that matter , so I must go by what people have said and try to give them the benefit of the doubt when writing these things. This movie was awful. The acting was terrible. There were some great actors, but this film was just horrible. The only positive is that the director made it into two films, which is a lot better than he would have done with just one film.If you are looking for a good sci fi thriller, this isn't it.|0
"15 PARK AVENUE is the address ""Mithi/Mithali"" (Konkona) is in search for from the movies beginning. ""Prof.Anu"" (Shabhana Azmi)is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half sister from Mithi's mom's earlier marriage. The movie revolves around these characters and looks into the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, through her continuous blabbering to Anu and others. Konkona deserves not one but thousands of awards (which I am sure, she will be getting)for this rendition of Mithi in this movie."|1
"""The Cell"" is a rather difficult film to classify. If you read the plot outline, ""a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim"", you might think it's a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn't really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing."|1
I had no expectations when I started to watch this movie. How surprised I was! This is a great, beautiful, twisted movie which will give your mind a good work-out! It's not simple. If you only enjoy Police Academy style, no-brains movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film with influences from movies like Cube, Silence of the Lambs and The Lawnmower Man, along with lots of completely new ideas. Wonderful, twisted environments, good acting and a compelling story makes this one of the best films I have seen in a long time!|1
"Usually, Alan Alda plays characters that are too ""soft"" and overly verbal -- it's probably how he really lives. This time, he fits the character. Though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered.The 1971 Attica Prison Riot and the State of New York's response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event. Only a few journalists have told the true story. This film provides a quick look at the horrors and excesses associated with the Attica riot/revolt. Attica had a major impact on this country."|1
Despite all it 's trappings of style and cinematic invention , this is basically another serial killer thriller , following the story of three young women who go to California to study but are murdered, along with an odd assortment of men. It took me nearly a month to see this movie. I have seen lots of action/horror movies, but rarely have I seen such a complete waste of film as this movie.There are four main characters and they all play key roles. There are lots of shots that look like they were made by someone who was very familiar with the source material.|0
I just saw this wonderfully filmed movie that captures the essence ofhigh-brow NYC , or any big city of mid-century modernist architecture, and it's great. I had to make an appointment as soon as I saw it in a theater on opening night. It was so good. The plot was interesting enough to keep me interested for the entire four-hour runtime (which I suppose is more than you can say for most movies).One of the things that keeps me coming back to these movies is that they always seem to go out of their way to avoid the clichés.|0
This film was made soon enough after Karen's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen's death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children.|1
This is a film that is far more enjoyable than its rating of 7 would suggest. In many ways, it's like a 50s version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS--with much of the excesses and sleaziness of VALLEY polished up a bit for the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are on the fast-track to success--though this time it's in the publishing world instead of the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies in THE BEST OF EVERYTHING does have aspirations of Broadway).The film begins with Hope Lange coming into the company for her first day of work.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex. Great movie!! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times. Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort. The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field.|1
Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much . The theme was well handled by the Director with great cinematography and music . There is something for everyone to enjoy. I thought the characters were well developed and the plot line worked well . The main problem, which I felt was made up for by a good performance by Rourke , could have been easily dealt with in a simple script . The dialogue was not as clear as it should be. It's a strange thing: I just came upon this on IMDb, and figured it'd be some generic B-horror/fantasy flick that I'd never actually like.|0
"This small John Ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces. It has a documentary-like feel to it as it traces the journey West of a party of Mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all Ford's films, (it's on par with ""The Sun Shines Bright"" which he made a couple of years later).There is a plot of sorts, (a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point), but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental."|1
I'm absolutely disgusted this movie isn't being sold. All who love this movie should email Disney and increase the demand for it. They'd eventually have to sell it then. I'd buy copies for everybody I know. Everything and everybody in this movie did a good job, and I haven't figured out why Disney hasn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental stores. At least I haven't seen any copies. This is a wicked good movie and should be seen by all. The kids in the new generation don't get to see it and I think they should.|1
I haven't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater, and I have been searching for it since. At the time I was 12 and the story excited me; and NOW, the ending eludes me. It was young love that engrossed me the most, not to mention John's vocals and Taupin's lyrics. The story (at the time) hit home to my psyche. I am a lover of sentimental movies and this still hangs in my head after 35 years- it is that good. Place yourself at adolescent age and let your fantasies run.|1
I first saw this one afternoon in the 80's on network T.V. I think I was like 9. (Picture seeing a violent horror flick nowadays on regular television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remembered,it's really good,scary flick. I think the reason why it might of gone unnoticed is cause it wasn't followed by a ****load of sequels i.e. Friday the 13th. But it's one of those movies that takes the original idea and does it better.|1
When I saw the preview for this movie , I figured to myself , `` here 's another dumb TV movie. That is until the title card on the DVD or Blu-Ray came on, and I couldn't stop watching.It's all over the place in places, and the plot seems like it's being shoved down your throat so you have to keep turning the TV. The action sequences are almost non-existent, and not to be blamed on the actors. As an example, there is a fight scene at the end of the movie which has been done in several movies before--but I was expecting that.|0
"First of all - I 'm not one to go all sappy over movies . I saw Friends in the cinema as a kid and I loved it because it was SO funny . But this movie has absolutely no jokes whatsoever. Okay, here's something I've never even heard of before. ""This is a horror movie!"" OK, maybe it isn't true, but it sure sounds that way. Well, you're in for a pretty crappy surprise when you sit down to watch this.The story is about a group of friends who visit a cabin on a secluded island where they find some gruesome murders."|0
Just Before Dawn really surprised me when I saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than I expected. Instead the director Jeff Lieberman conjures up a wonderfully evocative and disquieting atmosphere for great stretches of the movie, building the suspense constantly until I was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it. The lack of action in many parts gave it a very Deliverance mixed with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kinda ambiance, and when the action really kicks in, its truly shocking and dramatic, without ever even really needing to be gory.|1
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites . The unsung hero of his generation . Nobody knew he could write . He did it anyway . After reading this film, I began to think ""I wonder what those guys who made this crap would say about it""....it's pretty hard to see what they would have said except for a bunch of self-absorbed brats talking about how they were really the bad guys and we just had to follow. There are so many ways to say this film should have been rated TV-MA because of its graphic violence but there isn't one that does the job."|0
"Pat Conroy 's autobiographical book `` The Water Is Wide '' proves to be something of a Southern `` Up in Hudson "" knock-off. In fact it is the exact opposite. There is a certain beauty about the novel, even if it does not belong to that particular region. A good deal of time and energy are spent trying to nail down some kind of central idea. This movie is a classic example of what can happen when people don't give a shit about the things they're making. You might have noticed how I used the phrase ""classic example"" instead of ""perfect example."""|0
"there 's only so much that i can take of Filipino films , especially nowadays where the trend is sex and violence . Some of the shots were quite painful. It's very possible that this was done to ""save money"" but I found it hard to believe that the director, who had worked on numerous high-profile picture such as A Man Called Ove has to waste his precious cash on making one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. There are a lot of actors from the Philippines in this film, which seems to be a major reason for these scenes."|0
After getting hooked on the mini series , `` North & South , '' I could hardly wait for the movie to come out and when it finally did, I was utterly amazed at just how well they portrayed the characters. The best thing about this show is that all the people involved are good actors and actresses! The worst thing is that you need to be willing to sit through over twenty hours of terrible acting and dialogue to really understand any of them. You'll never get anything close to an intelligent or funny joke.|0
"As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for ""Dr. David Ravell"" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of ""A Reason to Love"", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles."|1
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short . Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a profound feeling of sympathy and love for the victim, which can never be expressed by writing. The viewer will understand the character's dilemma much better if he is moved to tears during the reading. First off, I must say that this book was one of the most horrible experiences I've ever had in my life! It was so hard to stomach, I actually cried through the whole thing. I couldn't even imagine how someone could have any kind of human emotions.|0
The Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment . This movie does a terrible job of portraying the facts, as well as putting into perspective how this happened. In many ways it is like the plot to The Devil Wears Prada, if that made any sense.I am sorry to say that I watched this movie for the first time. It did not make me enjoy it much, nor did I feel inspired to write anything about it afterwards. However, I do know what I saw.|0
This film blew me away. I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot. After watching this, I see I knew nothing. The story is told through the relationship between the attorney and the black inmate. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding courtroom drama were riveting. The flashback sequences in the prison were awesome. It's hard to believe it wasn't documentary footage it was so real. It was not only a great piece of drama, it was an incredible lesson in an important chapter in American history. I'm with Ebert and Roeper.|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film . It is an excellent entry point into independent film but it also shows us what happens when people make a mistake. I don't think there are good films made with this kind of situation. This is in no way a negative review; on the contrary, I find myself wondering how I got onto this site and why I ever bothered to check it for the first time. I found myself wanting to read the whole thing before getting to the parts about the actors.|0
During the War for Southern Independence, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against a Yankee invasion.In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular OUR GANG kids to branch out into occasional feature-length films. With the big success of Shirley Temple in two Civil War period movies in 1935 (THE LITTLE COLONEL, THE LITTLEST REBEL), it was only natural that Roach would look in that same direction for his GANG. Although given a rather lavish production and distributed by MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box-office success.|1
"Others have commented on the somewhat strange video arrangements. I think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance. The feet, the faces, the overall view. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short. But, having said that, watching Colin Dunne is nevertheless gratifying. It's an interesting contrast to Michael Flatley in the original video. The progression of the show is evident, changes from the original Dublin production are evident. ""Trading Taps"" is the highlight of the video, in my opinion."|1
"Eager electronics whiz Brian Foster (a likable performance by Wesley Eure of TV's ""Land of the Lost"") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (nicely played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is floundering. A rival company hires a pair of inept criminals to get their grubby hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. ; said task proves to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey relates the endearingly dopey story at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiably silly and lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair."|1
"My wife and I saw this when we were 17 . The only good thing my father ever did (and this is a good one, he never hurt anyone) was put me on the cover.I wish I'd gotten it when I was a kid! The plot of ""The Killing"" doesn't make any sense at all to me. It makes almost no sense that a man could be shot in the head while his wife and children were in the room. Even more confusing is the notion that someone could pull the trigger on such a low priority job."|0
What can I say? You expect only the best in drama from the BBC and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rule.MESSIAH is a great thriller, a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons. Police Officer Red Metcalfe (Ken Stott) and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events, before more lives are lost.But be warned - despite it's '15' rating (in the UK), MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film.|1
I finally received my DVD today , viewed it and I 'm pleased to announce this is the original theatrical film. It has all the classic aspects of the original but a totally different feel. The cinematography, lighting, sound etc have all been completely modernised. However I found myself missing one element which I felt could have had more than just a superficial effect on the audience; the music.It is absolutely fantastic and has no redeeming features as far as i am aware. If you are a diehard horror fan like myself, you will probably find something new here that you enjoyed.|0
Police officer Dirk Hendricks (Jamie Bartlett) files an amnesty application Alex Mpondo (Chiwetel Ejiofor).A member of the South African Parliament who cant remember the torture he once endured as a captive political activist.South African born attorney Sarah Barcant (Hilary Swank), meanwhile, returns to her homeland to represent Mpondo.As well as Steve Sizela, Mpondo's friend who was arrested along with him, and never heard from again.This film is one of the best films to come out about the South African regime of Aparthied, in the past.Everybody should watch it.|1
"First love . Teenage love . We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the first love. It is something that has to do with one or both people seeing their partner as being just as much of a ""best friend"" as anyone else and then they get together. This is more than possible in the present time where many people are now ""in love"" with their friends. In my opinion it's a stupid thing to do unless you like to take advantage of someone who might be your ""best friend"" (I guess the opposite could be true)."|0
I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes . I saw it again recently and have to say that this is by far one of the worst tv shows of my life. The plot is so shallow, the acting was appalling, the music was horrible, and the premise was so utterly ridiculous and illogical as to be unbelievable. The only thing saving this show from being awful was that the actors seemed to really enjoy doing it, even if the jokes were horribly written and poorly delivered.|0
"My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released . The controversy that surrounded the original release has not yet been overcome. It is a ""horror"" flick. But if you aren't used to horror movies, then it can be somewhat confusing.There are many elements in the movie that seem to have nothing to do with the book.The characters are completely artificial. They have no personality beyond what is written for them on the screen. There is no character development whatsoever in any of the relationships between these characters."|0
"This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you. This movie was great because it took the serious Robin Hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at. I first viewed this movie when i was around 10, and got most of it. This movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved, ""By order of the kings financial secretary H and R Blockhead? ""Everyone needs a little Cary Elwes(Robin Hood)in life, whether or not its Liar Liar with the ""Claw"" or Saw."|1
The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat , but as the film progresses I quickly found myself bored, as did everyone else watching it. The relationship between Spanky and Buckwheat is a happy one, however the two seem to dislike each other, causing Spanky's ego to be bruised. Why would you waste $8 on an 8 min movie called 'Buckwheat' when you can see the real thing for free? This production is all over the place so I won't bother to say how bad it is...I just know it ain't even close to 'the real deal'.|0
I have remembered this cartoon for over 50 years - what staying power it has ! It was funny and fun to watch when I was a child. There are many great cartoons from Charlie Brown to Snoopy. But there is ONE cartoon in particular that has stuck with me since my childhood. The story is about a kid who finds his lost golden key in a lake, but instead of taking it to the police he takes it back home and locks it up where no one can find it anymore. He decides to make a poster out of the key and give it as a gift to his dad.|0
An Intelligent and well obtained film worth to export ! In this exiting and really intelligent movie filmed entirely in New Mexico, it offers a very real insight into human nature, the people of that state and the society at large. It is true that many films about New Mexico have been seen before, but I cannot think of one which is so complete and convincing in every aspect. For the first time in my memory, I could not believe my eyes! When I watched this movie I was totally confused. Why would anyone waste money on a movie like this?|0
"10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration ( and music ) . I have always liked them, but i was very disappointed to hear that many of them were killed off so quickly .I really enjoyed the original film and I thought it should be revived. The director is an old friend of my late mother who gave me copies of her first two feature films in the mid-1950's at the height of her ""golden era"" of movies. She had been working steadily since 1928 when she won the Best Actress Academy Award for MAMMA WIVES IN LOVE."|0
"I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October, 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets , we saw a movie marquee advertising ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX."" So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away, our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid, ultra-conservative Orange County.Thirty two years later, I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store."|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent, unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters. In the same way I loathed Fargo on first viewing, then realized I was still thinking about it days later and enjoying it somehow, I liked Nurse Betty a lot more the day after I saw it. Hard to understand, harder to explain. As others have said, it's quite forced in many ways, but that seems to be part of what makes it so striking.Fair job by Greg Kinnear, great work from Morgan Freeman (although I worry that he's being stereotyped as the principled villain).|1
"what was the quote by archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person 's past ? this has to be an abomination of mankind!!! I've read reviews saying that I shouldn't have liked the film, which I couldn't agree with. I had my doubts when I first started watching it but they went away after I finished it. The characters and setting were all very interesting and made me feel as though I was really in their world. However, the acting was pretty bad. There were too many ""well acted"" people doing too many ""well acted"" things."|0
This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's; the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task through, and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.|1
One of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies. Such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short. Two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere shorts such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du bebe', wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting.|1
Susie Q. is one of those rare, and sweet movies that give you a warm feeling. It's bittersweet, but wholesome, and it's characters are fun, and captivating. At first, I thought the movie would be the cliché cuddly movie that would bore me after five minutes, but was I wrong. It made me tear up at times, and it's plot was enticing, making me root for the good guys. I loved the movie, and still remember it today, 9 years later!!|1
Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece . It 's Werner Herzog 's most unconventional film . It does n't have a happy ending but I would still rate it as a masterpiece. Oh my god. There's no way to describe this film. I've seen so many people saying it's the worst, or the worst ever, and that's just ridiculous. I actually think this film could have been so much worse had Herzog decided to do it in English instead of German (I'd say he should've done it in German at least).|0
Robin Hood : Men in Tights ( 1993 ) was a much needed parody from Mel Brooks . He has been trying hard to make something original lately, with this film. The story is that a group of guys go to the countryside to hunt a man who has escaped from prison, and are captured by the sheriff. They have to figure out a way out of the county when they find that the whole thing is just a trap set up by a local gang to capture the wrong guy for their own personal gain.|0
"spoiler--In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with ""Posse"". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba."|1
This movie has a lot to recommend it. The paintings, the music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are all gorgeous! The plot, a story of redemption, forgiveness, and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching -- and it's not predictable, which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age. But, the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It often felt like it was trying to be a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody *of*.|1
This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of 'Crazy Town' ) as I do not know anything about the plot of the show, but it is quite sad to see that the rest of the cast seem to have forgotten how to act. What can be done? The most obvious way is to make the actors better. This series is made for people in their 30s, 40s and 50s, which is what I'm trying to figure out. But maybe there is another way.|0
"""Two Hands"" is an entertaining, funny story about Australian lowlifes. The screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance. In a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and, ultimately, an understanding of a more personally promising world.The clueless Jimmy, portrayed with acumen by Heath Ledger, is a kid who grew up without opportunity."|1
"I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I went in with the assumption that if it stars Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank it had to be at least decent. Well, after a kind of a slow start, I was far from disappointed. In fact, I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa(?) accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Trainspotting"" or any other film with heavy-accented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes."|1
"The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter 's complex life . Though it fails in some areas, it still makes a fascinating story. I haven't read this movie, but I saw the trailer when it aired, so I'm pretty sure it isn't real. I didn't see the actual movie (I've never seen ""The Big Lebowski"" with subtitles), but I watched the trailer. Anyway, this is not a film made by one of the writers of ""The Big Lebowski""."|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s, its shocking how not a lot of people know about it.this movie is definitely worth a look. it has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old chills.i remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but i couldn't remember the name of it, so i came to IMDb a few years ago to ask for help on finding the title. i eventually got the name of the title, and bought the movie.|1
comeundone , I love you ! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie. The plot line is boring and the acting was nothing more than mediocre.The music was also very annoying. For one, there wasn't enough of it in the original film. It was so bad, that I actually couldn't listen to the soundtrack in the cinema after watching the film.And then there was the ending.It was the worst part of the whole film. If you watch the film, don't even think about the ending.|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ! I was not a huge fan of horror films back then and had no idea what to expect. I just saw this on opening night and was shocked. The first thing out of my mouth was ""what is that guy doing in that clown suit?"". Well it turns out he was playing a creepy clown, which is exactly what he is. This movie would have been good with an all-female cast, but alas, they didn't do it."|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if I'm interested in the plot. So yeah, this one wasn't much fun at all, but maybe that's the way it should be for most filmgoers. Why do I say this? I've never really paid attention to films that tried to be an American remake of a Japanese anime. This one was as bad as any of those ever were. It looked like it came straight out of an old episode of Gosei (Japanese comedy show) or some shit.|0
Personally , I regard `` The Egyptian '' in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Hollywood producer, but I had no interest in the book at the time: it seemed to have been hastily written with no forethought or care on the director's part.The story begins with the son of Queen Victoria trying to escape from his country and embark for India. He succeeds in making his way across the ocean and arrives in America in the late 1880's. He finds work as a cabaret singer in New York City and quickly marries the lovely Julia (Natalie Wood) .|0
My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy that surrounded the original release (teen nudity, physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our view of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to get caught up in the simplistic (at times) acting and the corny (at times) emotional twists. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have.|1
Ignore the bad reviews on here , this film is awesome ! `` Just Before Dawn '' is a great example of the kind of films that should be made in Germany. It is a real German thriller/action movie with some really cool action scenes as well. I would recommend this film to everyone. The cast is great and if you aren't one of their fans, you will have a lot of fun. I've seen so many horror movies over the years, but I can't name a single one that really stuck out as a worthy successor to the original Silent Hill.|0
Central Airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying. He meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts. The two start a relationship, but when Jim is hurt, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things get exciting and terribly terribly sad.This film is a pre-code because of several reasons.|1
This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines as the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind as Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the witty dialog, it's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is wicked great as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is terrific as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy as Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch.|1
"when I first heard about this movie , I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 90's. The story of ""The Man with Two Brains"" (the guy in the movie) has been compared to Dune by a number of people on the net. It is a great story, but I feel there are too many flaws with the storyline and the characters that I do not want to watch it again. If you have seen the TV series then I think it would be a good time to stop now."|0
A remarkable film, bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much, much younger. I loved it, and the Elton John music. I remember seeing in in the movies when I was a kid, and for some reason (limited release?) I've never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released.The dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me, and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back, I confess, however, that my kids (in their 20's) have not experienced a similar emotional rush.|1
this is a really great series. i love the show and i am so glad it isn't canceled yet. it has really good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. o yes for Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mom and me. ya for Gilmore girls. um, i'm running out of lines. but i love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship is finally shaping up. they so needed to be together. and i absolutely just love Sookie St. James!|1
My kids loved this movie. we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie. we watched it as a family and everyone of us enjoyed it. it was a movie you could watch without any uncomfortable spots that you would have to explain to the younger ones. my boys loved this movie and they would love to be able to see it again. even after all these years they remember it. that Amy Jo Johnson was a very cute girl. all my boys had crushes on her. they loved her as the pink power ranger which is why we watched this movie to begin with.|1
Minor spoilers follow , but nothing you wo n't have learned from reading the back of the DVD.Held together by a man who claims to love them and his best friend, the pair must fight to survive on a farm that is under attack by a vicious horde of mutant beasts. The only way to save the world is to use their incredible power to break free of this cage in an attempt to save themselves.I really can't think of any good reason for why I would be watching this movie.The characters don't move, look or speak. They are all just white guys with super powers.|0
One of the better made for TV biopics, I just wish it had told us more. I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease (especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control.|1
Well , okay , maybe not perfect , but it was pretty close . This movie jumped from crime drama to melodrama , all in the span of two minutes . The acting is horrible , even more so when we consider how well it was made . But I liked it anyway. I bought this movie because my wife thought it was really good, but I couldn't understand why others didn't enjoy it. Well, I don't know how else to explain it. The first half is like some kind of cheesy horror flick. The dialogue is awful.|0
"`` Two Hands '' is an entertaining , funny story about Australian lowlifes . The screenplay contrasts the world of ""sporting events"" with that of the ordinary. This is a film that will keep you hooked as it progresses. This movie was good. Not great, but there's no reason not to make this one at least moderately watchable. I was able to put in most of the information I needed and I'm quite pleased with the end result. It does take some serious effort to follow the script though. Some of the characters are somewhat off, which isn't surprising."|0
First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing that now, why should South Park blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing? And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Al Gore and his global warming hysteria.But all that aside, this episode is just plain funny. Al Gore's portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician I've ever seen, it was original, and it was based on peoples opinions of the man.|1
"In one of the many Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoons, Elmer Fudd is out hunting, and Daffy tries to get him to shoot Bugs. Needless to say, Bugs has his own agenda. Moreover, ""Rabbit Seasoning"" makes interesting use of word order and pronouns (warning: it just might hilariously and royally mess up your speech).I think that probably my favorite aspect of this cartoon is the costumes worn by Bugs and Daffy. One of them seems like it would have been risqué for 1952 (especially in a cartoon), but they pull it off perfectly, as they always did."|1
Having just watched this with my mother (Who got it for Christmas) i was thrilled to find something different to the usual stuff i usually watch. All of the stories were detailed and you are able to feel strong emotion towards each character from the very beginning. Every storyline is followed through brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for every single character. The cast is amazing, my personal favourites being James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray/LaMotte/Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, making very compulsive viewing, i recommend it to almost everyone.|1
Come on . Anyone who does n't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic or review site. There is a big problem with this movie when I say that. There are several ways to describe it. It has a bad script, the director/producer doesn't get his story straight and the special effects aren't good enough even if they are done well. And what is more? The characters themselves are so flat and forgettable that it is impossible to find anything memorable about them. They don't have personalities and no depth in their thoughts.|0
"My kids loved this movie . we watched it every chance we got.it was fun a fun movie . we had lots of laughs and tears but i didn't understand all the plot about the alien and what was his name. This movie is a disappointment! I love sci fi/fantasy, but nothing makes me want to watch that stuff more than this. If you're looking for something that can be entertaining, then at least make sure you're watching an actual sci fi or fantasy movie like ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Rip Van Winkle,"" etc."|0
If you repeat a lie enough number of times will it become the truth ? 15 park avenue is the perfect example ! I don't want to sound like a douchebag but this movie was way too much crap for its own good. I actually laughed out loud a lot at the story lines and how stupid they were (I can't believe everyone on planet earth thought that was funny!). It was boring, unrealistic and unoriginal. The plot was absolutely ridiculous. There were no real characters or any character development whatsoever. It's one of those movies where even the dialogue was pretty bad!|0
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Indians for what appears at first to be no apparent reason..that is until the Lone Ranger discovers from a conversation with the Indian Chief Tomache that each man possessed a medallion. The five medallions given by Tomache to his friends as gifts we later learn when combined will provide the mastermind behind the hooded raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medallions before the hooded raiders get their hands on it?|1
In Crystal City , a group of Mormons hire the horse traders Travis ( Ben Johnson ) and Sandy ( Sam Neill ) to help find their kidnapped daughter, Anna (Megan Fox). Saving Private Ryan is a terrible film that tries very hard to make you laugh at its own expense while making absolutely no attempt to even attempt to make you care about the story or characters. The film follows two soldiers in World War II as they try desperately to save their comrade's life after he is badly injured by enemy troops. When they fail, they turn on each other and are eventually shot dead.|0
This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park. Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without getting in trouble. He is able to swear at the other kids at school. Kyle tells the Principal that Cartman is faking it. But, she doesn't believe it. Chris Hansen is planning on having Cartman to be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later on, Cartman starts to get so addicted to be able to say whatever he wants, that he later on starts to accidentally say embarrassing stuff.|1
We saw this film in Toronto at the Film Festival last year . It was a truly moving experience . I thought it was one of the all time greats. The acting was perfect, the directing was masterful and the sets were stunning. I'll try to explain: First of all, there are many films out there that make fun of Scientology. This is one of the few that actually makes fun of its members. And even if you aren't Scientologist enough to enjoy it, it still makes fun of people who do for a living.|0
One of the genres that flourished during the decade of the 30s was the variation of crime fiction known as Westerns, which were popular in Hollywood during the early part of the decade. Westerns, and the films made from them, were a genre that featured violence, gunplay, and some very serious themes, all of which were not usually associated with children's movies at the time, let alone those made for teenagers or young adults. As an example, The Maltese Falcon is generally thought of as one of the worst movies ever made, but it had a lot of adult themes woven through it.|0
`` The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , '' says Marion Fairlie , who with her husband is a housewife. There are times when everything seems to be on the brink of a disaster, but none of these can happen. We've been waiting all summer for this and now here we go. This film is one of the most disappointing things I have ever witnessed. I am not going to say it sucks because it doesn't. It's just that the plot is so horribly convoluted that it makes it seem like the worst movie ever made.|0
Loved the shots of airports -- Dallas , Phoenix , Fresno , etc. , just single buildings with the name of the city in it. But I don't see the point of an entire country being destroyed by one bomb. The movie doesn't look good, the actors and actresses are uninteresting and the plot is absurd. The story revolves around a man who has lost his wife and is searching for his missing child. There are a couple of interesting twists and turns, but after the movie ends everyone is talking about some other things so we are left to wonder what is going on.|0
Based on Mika Waltari's Book,This Second CinemaScope movie ever made is full of rich color,beautiful music and panoramic spectacle.The Plot sometimes gets muddled in contrite wording,But all in all it has a strong social content:Man is ruled by his emotions,and that every action has an equal consequence.But to truly enjoy this film,First see the movie,then read the book.Although different,it sheds light on a whole lot of things that were not seen on the screen,and gives breath to some more of the depth of Sinuhe.|1
`` Jaded '' should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure.The movie starts like any other Bollywood film but soon the story takes a strange turn and twists into a bizarre conspiracy thriller. As I said in previous reviews, I don't see the appeal of this movie. The characters are weak, the plot is very thin and the dialog is poor. I think the only thing that can redeem the movie is the music - it helps to give the sense of tension. I got this when it was offered for sale through a book club.|0
"Great Movie! The sound track is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film! The movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the movie to a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song ""Honey Roll"" and poem ""I Meant To Do My Work Today"" by Richard Le Gallienne was incredible! Kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film!"|1
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years, Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was, yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film, but to live it.|1
"I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly wanted to wanted to see again. When I saw Raquel Welch's name in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. It was actually mildly entertaining, and took me back ""in the wayback machine"" to the farcical movies that Hollywood churned out during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers stuff. Oh the acting was not superb, nor was the plot, but it was worth watching."|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that. Well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out. It has nicely predicted the conditioning of human minds with that of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem accordingly.Hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways.|1
I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend . It was a fun romp with some cool monsters. The acting was decent but I felt like the screenplay didn't follow what actually happened . The film is pretty bad-taste from the beginning. In fact, you don't even need to be a huge fan of horror to see this one (there are plenty of people in this genre who wouldn't bother to watch it anyway!). There are so many clichés going on here that it's hard to keep track of how they are supposed to relate to each other or not.|0
"Jordan takes us into the seedy crime side of Sydney , Australia , following the desperate attempt of nineteen year old James (Trenton Williams ) to make his own way through the world. He works odd jobs in the city and meets a mysterious woman named Amy (Samantha Morton) who may be his soul mate; or is she just another serial killer living under her roof? I had read several reviews about this film online, and knew that it was going to not be good. But when I saw ""The Revenant,"" I couldn't say no to it."|0
Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot-twister one of the best American films I have seen this year. Neil Labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while Renée Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney all give uproarious, tongue in cheek performances. The greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie Soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.|1
* * SPOILERS AHEAD * * It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to besuch a waste of potential. The only redeeming thing about this movie are the two excellent performances of Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone. If you were hoping for an original interpretation of the tale, then I guess you were disappointed as there is no original story to hold your interest.I would have liked to have seen more dialog in this one. There are some great action sequences in the movie. What's interesting, though, is how uninspired and generic the plot is.|0
I have just seen a very original film that I would recommend to everyone including ` the young & the foolish. It's got an old-timey feel, which is quite refreshing when you consider it's on the big screen! It was a shame to see the quality deteriorate, as the cast were so talented.The script isn't bad, but after a few hundred pages it kind of falls apart... I recently saw this film from the Criterion collection for $6.99. A buddy and I were looking for something different to try, since we're usually pretty serious about our books.|0
"This was a pretty good episode. Though no ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Cartoon Wars,"" it had a lot of things going for it. The character of Al Gore and that bizarre-as-hell ""super cereal"" thing was pretty darn funny. But, the scene that made me adore this episode was one I'm sure everyone will agree was one of the greatest Cartman/Kyle moments ever. When Cartman is superstitious of Kyle that he'll be stealing his gold(which of course is fake! ), and he comes within inches of his face."|1
Brilliant film ! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats not a good thing, it was too dark and there were so many bad actors, i would like to see the movie with someone who knows acting ! Just when I thought everything about this film was bad, well, here comes something new... The characters are horrible. The whole plot is stupid. It takes place in 1950s France and revolves around a man being sent by his girlfriend (Sonia) to take care of her brother who is going insane.|0
"This is the story of a guy who went up to see a comedy and it turned out to be a horror movie. The true story of a guy who's infatuated with pictures and got scared when he identified himself unexpectedly with one of them. The unbelievable story of A GUY who got scarier when the female-hero was deluding herself as well as the male-villain. Gosh, is this what life made us be? People deluding themselves about the perfect face imagining how that face should be perfect inside? ""Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore""."|1
"After ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"" with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as dangerous as men, there was obviously an open market for other movies to pick up and carry the torch and what more a lovely actress than Dorothy Provine from ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" to play the role. The downsize is that cute and blonde Provine may just be too sweet and innocent looking to step into Allison Hayes' size 50 shoes. This role really needed someone with an amount of smoldering sex appeal; Provine is more the girl next door type."|1
One of the biggest French success of the year 2002 , `` l'auberge espagnole '' was also very well greeted in the USA, with many moviegoers making pilgrimages to see it on their holidays. This movie is one of the few that have nothing to do with cinema as we know it today.It is a sort of pseudo-comedy that makes light of a serious issue but does not provide any solution for it either. If you need to understand this film just watch it. Very poor film, especially compared to most of Hollywood's recent fare.|0
With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing.|1
I own the miniseries on DVD because I love this story so much. This is one of the best period pieces on the Civil War that I have seen that tells a story of friendship divided by the war. The costumes are great, the story lines are great, I love how the story jumps around from character to character to keep you guessing as to what's going to happen next in their lives. There is a great balance of good and evil. Some of the characters that are evil in my opinion are too good not to watch.|1
In Mississippi, the former blues man Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife that has just left him. He finds the town slut and nymphomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) dumped on the road nearby his little farm, drugged, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, giving medicine and nursing and nourishing her like a father, keeping her chained to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is discharged from the army due to his anxiety issue, he misunderstands the relationship of Lazarus and Rae, and tries to kill him.|1
Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post Saved By The Bell acting? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is right to give this movie a `10' rating? Hahahahahaha... that's funny. This movie wasn't so horrible, though; better than I expected it to be. Made-for-TV movies are often so so so similar. So many of them have the same feel to them. This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife who's gotta get the b*stard in the end story.|1
I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn ` t get to see the original teleplay untill a couple years ago, so I am curious to see if ANY of the movies that are mentioned can be made into TV shows. I think that it should not happen. I don`t like seeing people die in stupid films, even if they are really bad, and this isn`t any better than that. Also, I hope there is never any more sequels... The first film was pretty bad. The second was just awful.|0
"What can you possibly say ? This is the uncut hardcore , musical Alice ! It works too with a bit of jazz . This is not for the weak of heart. I really don't care what anyone else thinks about it. This was a real pain in the ass (I'm only giving this 5 out of 10, as I didn't get all the ""fun"" out of it), but that being said...it wasn't THAT BAD. Maybe if I were a better person, I would be able to appreciate the subtleties at least."|0
If you want to see a movie with nudity , sex , drugs , alcohol , brutal beating of a woman on camera , then you should buy this film , if you don't know why, I'll tell you . There has been a lot of talk about 'The Purge' lately in the wake of it being released last November. I am not going to discuss all the good points of the film but will instead highlight some bad points.First off: It doesn't really try to be anything new. There is no story that hasn't been done before.|0
The make -or-break of a love story for me is whether or not I like the characters and also if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikeable: aloof, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take. I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable. He overcompensates by bragging that he'l nail Amy. He acts so cool around Amy that he strikes out twice. When they do talk he can't show her who he really is.|1
After a summer full of retreads and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I have ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves that he can direct more then disturbing pictures of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were the brillant In the Company of Men, and the almost brillant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best performance of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessing the brutal death of her asshole husband (LaBute mainstay Aaron Eckhart), and gets lost in a fantasy world.|1
This movie was so cool! I saw it on a Friday night with a couple of my friends. While the first credits were rolling, we saw that Lionsgate Films had made this movie. They are the ones that made that stupid movie Wolf Creek, which was totally gay! When we saw this, we groaned. We thought it was going to be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie was not only better than Wolf Creek (which really isn't that hard) it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time!|1
Most of these reviews are dead on, so I'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of questions I've seen on here.While the characters seem and look young (hence the controversy), the actor/actress themselves were 17 and 18 at the time and so obviously over the 16 barrier. Here in the USA, that's still somewhat controversial but the simplicity and innocence of the film does much to offset it.I'm sorry not to have seen more by Sean; in this movie at least his expressions are demonstrative and obvious; you know exactly what the character is feeling whether he's angry, afraid, or confused.|1
I didn't have very high expectations about Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's all the same every time. Maybe I'm a bit masochistic? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's about a little group of teenagers going in the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they get killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic!|1
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War . My aunt actually played in this movie as a child. Her father died in World War II, and she was very close to my mother at the time. I saw the movie with some trepidation but it was definitely worth the wait. The first part of this film tells the story of an American who has just returned from war and is being sent home by his wife. His daughter is taken in by a family in Canada who also have recently returned from war.|0
If this is not my favorite movie of all time, it definitely is in the top five. I love this. Everything about this is perfect--the clothes, the set, the lines--yes, they're not how normal people talk, but... Right down to the small scenes, especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes, picking a wedgie, watering the office ivy plant, putting lunch in the fridge... Identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005. I think all the minor characters are wonderful.|1
I saw this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival . I went in with the assumption that it would be a typical melodrama of the genre; however, this film is so much more. The story is so simple that it makes it hard to follow. However, the movie is so interesting that you find yourself wondering how the hell it ended up getting made. The only reason why I watched this is because of the director(s). This film has some great performances on each character, but there was just no real depth to any of them.|0
"A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title . It draws parallels between the attitudes of young women and men in the late 1960's. The movie, in fact, is so bad that it makes you feel sorry for the producers who thought they could pull this crap off. They were very smart, however, because they used the film to illustrate some of the many problems of an oversexed society.For example:
The main characters are portrayed as self-absorbed spoiled brats who don't understand or respect their elders' opinions."|0
"George Cukor is and always will be one of my favorites. The unsung hero of his generation. Nobody mentions Cukor in the same breath as John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler or Billy Wilder and yet, look at his filmography. From sparkling comedies ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""Adam's Rib"" ""Holiday"" Psycho melodramas ""Gaslight"" ""A Double Life"" a great semi western ""Heller in Pink Tights"" not to mention ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Travels with my Aunt"" He was at the service of his actors, he never put himself in front of the camera."|1
"Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art-house, live-action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg - ""Un ballo in maschera"" - This segment may very well spoil the film for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow, mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot (a hackneyed one, at that)."|1
"This story has held a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years . As a boy , I can remember seeing this film and thinking to myself ""this is where it all started!"" I have just recently seen this film again and I can't believe the same old thing that made such a good impression in my youth is being presented again! When I was a kid, when I was eight or nine, I used to rent this movie. It was one of those movies that had so much hype on it, but when you actually watch the movie, the hype disappears."|0
I caught this flick on the trail end of a tape I had used to capture a movie I truly love. There's just nothing wrong with it other than being a waste of an hour. It's funny but not good. This film makes me want to vomit and I will never watch it ever again. I can't believe people actually pay $10 for this kind of filth. People should have seen it years ago. The most disturbing scenes in this movie were where they cut up a dog and forced it to eat some of the blood.|0
Just Before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send chills down your spine every time you watch it. The story and the acting are great. The special effects are some of the best ever used on a cinema screen and the set pieces are simply stunning. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. You can't see any redeeming value in this film. If anything, it made me sick to my stomach. Don't get me wrong; there is some decent acting going on in this movie, but not worth $5.|0
I didn't personally know Karen Carpenter, nor, Richard for that matter, so I must go by how the movie portrayed her. I think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I did see and learn of Karen, I felt her pain, share her sadness, and she was a very special person to me growing up. I know that I wasn't born until 1965 so I didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but I definitely grew up listening to her music and I have fond memories of her music.|1
Obsessed ! ! ! ! ! I have every season of Gilmore Girls and I think the reason I love it so much is because of the characters. I can't stop listening to this show because they are so damn annoying. This movie does not help their image either as they seem to be such a boring bunch of people in their everyday lives. As someone who watches a lot of TV shows, I know how irritating some episodes can be. The first few seasons of Gilmore Girls (which ran from 1999-2004) were great fun, but then the next three years went downhill.|0
I love this film ( dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish , not to mention cheap ). I'm not going to criticise the actors, or anyone else who had any part in this poor production. As an actor I did have a decent performance, just not one of my best. I don't mean to sound harsh... but it was just that. This isn't exactly a great movie. It has its good points, particularly the strong chemistry between Mandy Patinkin and Robert Stack. And it has a decent script, but nothing extraordinary.|0
The most enjoyable pet movie since Scooby Doo and Garfield. The story revolves around a 23 year old inventor named Brian Foster whose systems at his boss's company seems to keep failing, Brian is also dating the boss's daughter named Casey. But Brian secretly invented a robotic dog named CHOMPS, modeled after his own dog Rascal. But CHOMPS is no ordinarily dog, he is as fast as a cheetah, he has x-ray vision, can leap about 6 feet, and has a strength of 20 men. The new invention impresses his boss, and makes his business a success.|1
Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It seems to have already died. Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I've seen the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, Festen being a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking.|1
This is one of those movies that was never publicized and therefore was missed when it originally played in the theaters.I came across it while switching TV channels and was immediately engrossed in this story of an aging rodeo bum whose recklessness and lack of responsibility hurt everyone around him. I've often wanted to see the movie again but couldn't even remember its name, and have never seen it in the rental stores.James Coburn and Slim Pickens were excellent in their roles, and the rodeo footage was first rate. While being an action movie and having a western setting and theme it could be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their taste in films.|1
My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired.|1
"Onstage John Osborne's adaptation of ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fine tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright.On screen with some editing it becomes a bit sloppy due to the cutting of 3 crucial scenes from the play (one being an important scene between Basil and Henry showing that time has passed. )The acting however is brilliant. Sir john Gielgud return's to his Wilde roots as lord Henry,and although about a decade too old for the role,he totally becomes the enigmatic,life loving cad and cynic that Wilde brought to life so meticulously in his novella."|1
The film begins with a cranky old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran character actor Richard Carle) being driven by a man hoping to sell him a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car becomes stuck in the mud and so they are forced to look for some place to spend the night. Fortunately, there's a mansion nearby though it seems pretty odd that the people inside know the writer and he says he didn't realize this was the home of a man he knew (and despised).|1
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition.|1
Nurse Betty has that odd but winning combination of a repellent , unease-inducing plot with extraordinary characters . In the end I just can't think of why she didn't write it better, and why so many people don't like it even after seeing it all the other way round. It's always hard to get a grasp on this sort of thing without seeing the movie first, but here's what I see from watching this movie. The premise sounds good at the very beginning, with an American family moving into an isolated European village in order to stay safe during the holocaust.|0
"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is the one that made laugh the most, definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like ""he's faking"". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, to the principal, to anybody."|1
This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is . This is the true story of one woman and one man who were together for almost thirty years while they struggled to keep their relationship a secret. I've never seen a more pathetic attempt at being a documentary. It makes me feel bad for the director, because he apparently doesn't know how to make documentaries. I have to agree with people who are offended by this. You can get an award-winning documentary made as long as you don't use the term 'documentary'. A documentary must be about something--something that affects the viewer.|0
This was the one movie to see about the Civi War. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding scene, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The script was genuine, and accurate. The costumes were tastefully done, the seqence was in order and even the accents were good. I dearly love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even had a great supporting cast. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American History, and I love movies about it.|1
Having just watched this with my mother ( Who got it for Christmas ) i was thrilled to find something that was both entertaining and very, very accurate . As far as the plot is concerned it is nothing but a re-creation of The Man in the High Castle. I could not believe they were capable of even attempting to make a show based on a movie which is such a complete and utter failure ! Let's get this straight.. This movie isn't bad. But it doesn't take anything else from the original novel. It borrows a few details here and there.|0
I 'd honestly give this movie a solid 7.5 , but I clicked 10 to try to offset the 5 it was going to get because of all the bad reviews. Now I can't really explain why, but now I'm glad I did.Let's start at the beginning. After we learn that there were people on the other side of the moon who didn't like what they saw, Dr. Weir is asked to come back and save the day. He takes one look at the picture on the screen and decides that he wants out.|0
'The Cell' is a journey into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this literally. The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality.|1
The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines. The reason why Jarman's version left me fairly cold is that I didn't have a clue what he was on about. What is the underlying vision/idea/concept behind this rendering of Shakespeare? The previous reviewers do not get much further than revenge tragedy, punk show, but surely there is more to it, isn't there?|1
Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from 'Two Hands'. But how wrong I was. From start to finish, you're kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while. Even in terms of mise-en-scene and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination. If you're looking for a film which is not only entertaining, but also provocative, compelling, and genuinely extraordinary, then make this the next film you watch.|1
The show is GREAT . No words to describe it . Wonderful music . Incredible dance . The editors could never think of anything to add to this wonderful series . You can't find a more perfect adaptation of an already well-known and loved piece of literature in any language. I am a HUGE fan of Shakespeare's plays. But, even if I was NOT a big fan of Shakespeare, the fact remains that I CANNOT think of ANYTHING he would not have done. I must admit that I was very excited to receive this book.|0
"This epic brings together a superbly-gifted cast and crew , a narrative depth superior to most novels , wonderful music and the best acting I have ever seen on television . If you like a good action flick with a very smart, subtle plot that moves forward at a slower pace than most others, then this may be the book for you. You will feel it in your chest as the credits roll when they end. But if you want an entertaining but not overly serious science fiction tale, then you might prefer something more like ""Darkest Hour"" by Philip K. Dick or ""The Matrix""."|0
when I first heard about this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed the music was by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing to loose, so I got it. What a Surprise!!! The movie was awesome. It was true love is all about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, yet they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all critized my tastes, and even called me names, becuase the movie featured two minors naked.|1
This game is very good for the n64. You can skate as Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, and maybe some more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the gameplay is awesome. The level School II is a great level with so much to skate. In Career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes.|1
I was mighty impressed with Nurse Betty all the way through . It has a great ensemble of characters , including some that I had never heard before. The plot is not very complex, it's as simple as that. And you have to be pretty darned gullible to enjoy it. This movie is by far the least interesting one I've ever seen.The plot revolves around an elderly woman and her son who are on a trip to visit their grandson in Texas. At one point during the journey, she goes insane and murders someone else.|0
The Killing Yard is a great film , although uneven at times . Morris Chestnut puts forth a phenomenal effort in what was one of his most significant roles, but for some reason or another he's never really received much respect from critics. Well, this movie was awful. I mean it was so bad that I had to make my mother watch it first and just see what she thought of it before I could give any sort of review.It started with the title character sitting at home in her house, crying about something (she isn't very bright), when a knock on the door interrupts her.|0
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford 's work . Mainly because it 's the only one I know of that is made for television. This was, and still is, one of the best films filmed for television in the last twenty or so years. It's about a man who lives in an old wagon and is able to travel through time on his own wagons. I have seen the trailer for this movie twice now, both times as part of a DVD collection. There is nothing bad about it in the trailer, but the trailer is a lie.|0
"I do n't think I have ever seen a better movie parody . Mel Brooks is insane . EVERY time he says his lines, you can hear the audience rolling their eyes and groaning . There really is no other way to describe the movie.The only thing that kept this from being an ""All time"" favorite is the fact that everyone else was having so much fun with it . This film is one of my all time worst films...it's so bad, it's hard for me to write about it. The premise is ridiculous, and there's nothing funny about it at all."|0
"""Side Show"" is one of the weirdest Horror movies ever made from Full Moon Pictures. Very gory in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer makes it out to be (The Trailer for this movies shows all the gory parts). Also, the acting and visual effects are well done. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.8 out of 10Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks."|1
... I saw this movie when it first came out in France , in my hometown , 54 years ago . I was not too interested back then, but as soon as i saw the picture it became very attractive for me. The film is about the death of a soldier who deserted his platoon and fought in the Vietcong. So, he's killed on his way back home. It's a very tragic story, and one that should be told again and again so that it will no doubt come to the attention of the politicians.|0
"I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the Film ""Dead Rail"" Which later aired as ""Alien Express."" And, I have to say that for my part I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. As a struggling actor this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me great scenes to include on my reel, and it allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (no waiting tables!) Turi(the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) Were very kind by giving me this opportunity to participate in the production."|1
"I guess my husband and I are a little slow. We don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life. In this case, we didn't start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. Other than the fact that we are not big fans of ""appointment"" TV viewing. Our schedules our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on (and we didn't have a DVR yet)."|1
Almost four years after the Iraq war started and we're in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all those flag wavers who were so sure of the right and might of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't that true? You bet it is. This movie said so from the beginning. It is kind of freaky how much the film,or should I say, filmmaker, knew what was coming. It is almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what was going to happen in the future.|1
"*spoiler* *spoilers* *spoilers* I found the film amusing.It was weird and I enjoy it,I laughed a lot so the bottom line is that I recommend the film.However I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say.The plot is very simple.Betty(Renee Zellweger), a hard life house wife watch her husband being murdered and while having forgotten everything she had seen,she follow her ""true love"" for a soap series character,Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough but not enough to hold a 95 minutes film."|1
"I've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's proper rebirth on DVD. Of course it didn't have the same impact on me as it would have if I had seen in it the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film ""Squirm"" is excellent) makes good use of the lovely Oregon location and takes the time to develop the characters, not just to have them dispatched in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music is really creepy and adds to the desolate proceedings making this great fun for genre fans."|1
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once.|1
This is a really great film! It gets you thinking about your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really make an effort to know who they are as people. And just as important, we should remember to open up and show them our real selves, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely see this documentary! IMDb is making me write more text before they will post my comment, how odd. Usually online comments need to be short short, and here I am being asked to write more!|1
"I saw the movie in 1972 , and like other people who have commented on it here ... I went into it thinking ""it's going to be as bad as it looks"", and it ended up being worse than I thought, even though I liked it at the beginning. The story is very simple: an ex-nazi soldier returns to his small town after the war, which he was sent to fight against. He runs into one of his old enemies, a guy with a big nose, who turns out to be a secret government agent."|0
There is a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story , where both Carpenters are in a recording studio and make some lame song about the good old days; then they meet up to make up for their missed calls with each other. I really do not understand why anyone would write a film this bad. There are two of them! In my opinion they should just have split up and never worked together again. They could have been friends. The writing is awful. What's the point, if it isn't to show off the talents of the directors.|0
Brian ( Wesley Eure ) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton ( Conrad Bain ) . The company is involved in a robbery attempt that goes awry when one of the robbers gets into a car accident, causing him to go insane with the power of telekinetic energy.The movie takes place at about the time of the Cold War and has a plot about a group of mad scientists that want to create a super soldier that would be invincible. I hate this movie, so I'm not going to try and pretend it's anything but a complete bore.|0
There are a few things in life that we ca n't experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. What can I do to make it easier for people to go back there when they're old enough to leave? I had no idea how bad this movie was going to get, but then again I don't think anyone did. This could have been a great movie if not for the terrible acting, terrible directing, horrible script writing, poor production value (at least on the first two parts), awful plot, lousy performances by everyone involved, and absolutely awful effects.|0
"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so nice, and I really fall in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... Please, if you know where i could find a VHS of the film, mail me!! My husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. I think we both cried our eyes out."|1
Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn't know they were citizens.|1
Fata Morgana is, by far, one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary because, while is does have elements of documentation of it's images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear, that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist. The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider, be it alien or something otherwise indescribable, all taking place in the Sahara desert.|1
I saw Chomps during the - approximately - 2 days of its theatrical release . It is a delightfully cute film.The first 20 minutes or so were quite well done, but then it became somewhat predictable as the film went on and I lost interest in what was being presented. I don't really see this as a bad film though; it just wasn't very original at all.There are no characters other than a boy named Chomps that we learn about throughout the entire length of the film. The film's only real redeeming feature would have to be the soundtrack.|0
"After seeing Meredith in ""Beyond the Prairie"" I had to buy another film with her staring. I cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick. It's best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network comes out with a DVD on ""Beyond the Prairie"". It's worth it at any price, this one needs to pay you to see. This pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman."|1
This movie was awesome , if you want a movie with non-stop puns and laughter then this is right for you! It starts with an accident that turns the lives of two young children into a nightmare, leaving them with a parent who does not care, a father who is very sick and a mother who has given up on caring. What follows is a trip through some dark and creepy places. This movie has no good moments, it's just all too sad. The only redeeming quality I can think of is how fast they got away with making the kids look stupid at every turn.The movie never goes anywhere.|0
"I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music.I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any.I bought some old movies like "" Melody"" in Hong Kong, who had quite a collection of old movie, but they did not have this."|1
"Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest , most clever , sharp-witted , sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I 've ever seen. It's a must have for all lovers of good writing, humour, comedy and friendship . I really liked the show ""The Gilmore Girls"", but this movie didn't do it for me. Sure, it had a great storyline and some great characters, but there was something lacking in the acting. Amy Poehler gives off that ""she's too good for her own good"" attitude, so it would be nice to see another person like her doing the role."|0
I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie.|1
"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are `` Blue '' . I have been around the block a few times since then and found no evidence to suggest that any of the older folks I see still believe it, except for a couple of people who do not know what blue is. The only thing about Blue that really gets me is when someone else tells me ""Blue"" means something else than they actually mean. It was always my expectation that there would be an overabundance of stereotypes (and jokes) involved with this film, and I was completely wrong."|0
I really like this show . It has drama , romance , and comedy all rolled into one . I also think the characters are likable and have interesting backstories. This show may not be for everyone but for some it will make them realize that love isn't something you can pick up in a bar and walk away with . I was so sad to see that someone had to die, but I hope that there will be other lives that are spared. If you haven't seen this show yet, then go watch it.|0
"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* -""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital."|1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars ! I really do n't care what people can say badly about it ; it's just one of those movies we all love & want to re-watch! But the problem is that it's also one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What was the main idea behind the story? It was about a group of friends on a trip to Las Vegas. However, not much time goes by while they are in town, so things happen which should have no relevance to the plot.|0
One of the most pleasurable aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film . To have it not just take you out of the experience and into a void, but actually turn your own life upside down. The only thing that I could do to prevent this was to close all windows, or at least try to find a comfortable position so as to not wake my sleeping spouse. I am sure there is a way around this. I'm sorry. And while I don't mean to sound rude, I really hope that one of these movies never gets made.|0
"Personally, I regard ""The Egyptian"" in an extremely favourable light.It was introduced to me by a well-known Australian movie commenter & critic named Bill who was renowned for his insight & broad vision of people & places & particularly of films. This movie fitted the Bill perfectly & I came to appreciate his commentary & enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as I watched it, as I was literally drawn into it, minute by minute, beyond his introductory comments, on my initial viewing many years ago.To me, it was propelled, layer upon layer, within half an hour, into an intriguing & fascinating production!"|1
Sweeping drama with great sets , costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett , Scarlett , Melanie Griffith (as the mother) and a few others but they're all pretty bad ! I have always liked the movies from this line because I was a big fan of Burt Lancaster, and had seen his films before. This movie was by far one of the most disappointing ones I've ever had the displeasure to experience! The acting was terrible. I can't believe that we got a film like this on video release.|0
The trailer to this film focused so much on the chain (of course, because it's so sensational) that it missed most of the movie, which is about a developing, although rather simply drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other.Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved. However, at it's core, Black Snake Moan is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along.|1
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer.|1
"It's interesting to watch how late 1950's society is depicted in this film. Men are lecherous, chain-smoking boozers with one thing on their minds (time hasn't changed men all that much, but ""sexual harassment"" has) & women are in the workplace only passing time until they find a husband & settle down. Some of the dialog is cringe-worthy but yet it's charming in an innocent, passé way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic, exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing ""The Best Of Everything"" on the soundtrack."|1
If there's one cartoon that helped to put UPA on the map more than any other, It's Gerald McBoing-Boing. This tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last 57 years. Besides the effects, loved the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narration by Marvin Miller, pretty much everything. And it won the Oscar for Best Animated Short of 1950. Glad to have seen it on YouTube after reading about this Dr. Seuss story for so many years. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how awesome!|1
Just watched Conrack for the first time. Although the last third of the movie leaves something to be desired, it is a very touching and heartwarming study of a man's evolution to overcome his youth and upbringing in a prejudiced south and a teacher's creativity in connecting with students despite different backgrounds and difficult circumstances. As an educator, seeing a teacher adapt to his students and prepare them for all of the challenges life has to offer, not just the lessons found in textbooks, is a valuable concept of which we all need to be reminded.|1
"That's a bad, raunchy, predictable, tacky, salacious soap opera? ""The Best of Everything"" is just such a guilty pleasure for me, something along the lines of ""Valley of the Dolls"". I mean, ""Best"" has everything. Somebody gets pregnant out of wedlock (when's the last time you heard THAT phrase? ), there are affairs everywhere, drinking, backstabbing, jealousy, and even a tragic but not altogether unexpected death.Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) and Mike Rice (the delicious Stephen Boyd) are the centerpieces of the goings-on."|1
Well its a great work by Aparnaji and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a big scene coming out. I watched this movie when I was in high school and i did not enjoy it. I was very bored at the film and didnt want to sit through the entire movie. It just wasn't for me. The acting was decent but I do not remember any plot points. The story line was kind of interesting but not original. In fact, I could have easily told you about all the other good movies that came out after this movie.|0
The show is GREAT. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors couldn't spoil it, not because they were not *that*bad*, but because the show is really *that*good*.The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 secs. It's OK to show various angles, but those guys were working with multiple cameras for the first time in their lives, and they will remind you of how many cameras they have every five seconds on average...|1
Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies that 's been released lately . It was funny , it was clever and it brought some new characters to the genre . The movie got a bad reputation from people who were too busy with other movies to watch it . I'm still trying to understand this movie! My mom saw it at the cinema when she was 8. I didn't like it and I wasn't really disappointed. This movie is so poorly made you couldn't believe it was made. I just don't understand how somebody could think it was a good movie.|0
As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's. I remember being really disappointed that there didn't seem to be anything about this kind of life outside of the cinema. This is one of the most ridiculous films I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. I am not sure what makes this film so offensive to any viewer, but it definitely does. The script has an appalling lack of understanding and logic at the very least. It could have easily been made into a television comedy with the same level of hilarity and comedic accuracy.|0
Working at a movie theater as a projectionist , I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes through the screen. While I don't mind movies that are boring, this one definitely wasn't.I'm not even mad because I actually liked it. The film is about a bunch of friends who move to a new town and live together. One of the guys decides to leave for college, where he meets a mysterious girl. I was really surprised by this film. My first thought was that something must have gone wrong during the pre-production.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko . I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I've read here on IMDB are either trying to give this film a poor rating or think that it's somehow bad because of the music. While I understand the sentiment, it is not the case. The music was fine and helped to keep things moving along at a reasonable pace. However, as I mentioned, there were a few scenes where the music seemed to interfere with the scene being shown on the screen.|0
Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission he is killed by the mysterious woman who took him. He is reincarnated as one of the girls who was taken from him. The only time i ever wanted to kill a bad guy with a knife was when I was in high school, this is because if you're not good at stabbing people it's easier to kill them with knives.This film is awful!First of all, the main protagonist can never get more than one girl at a time, so that's fine.|0
Together with the even more underrated , The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well acted by members of Ford's 'stock company', including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond,and Harry Carey, Jr.Like almost all of Ford's films,it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all his faults, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.|1
"A quick glance at the premise of this film would seem to indicate just another dumb '80's inbred/backwood slash-fest; the type where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes you actually want to die. However, ""JBD"" delivers considerably more.Rather than focus on bare flesh and gore (though there is a little of each- no sex however), the flick focuses on delivering impending dread/mounting tension amidst a lovely scenic backdrop. These feelings are further heightened by a cast of realistically likable characters and antagonists that are more amoral than cardboard definitions of evil."|1
During the War for Southern Independence , GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes his forces to defend the local women & children against the brutal savagery of the Indian enemies. A very good movie, though not one I actually enjoyed watching; it is a well made film with some fine actors. It starts off well enough that you can't help but get invested in everything that happens, and yet it never develops as a whole. The plot is interesting, but the ending leaves a lot unresolved, and makes the movie hard to follow at times.|0
10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately:Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing.|1
Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford films, like The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Grapes of Wrath among others, but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a wagon train of Mormons get to California. Along the way, they run into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos.|1
I saw it in Europe-plex . Great movie ! ! This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Devil. There are many scenes which make you wonder if they were ever actually filmed. But I found them to be well acted, with the lead actor doing a fantastic job. I was very disappointed after viewing this movie. First of all, I'm a big fan of The Exorcist/Ozymandias trilogy, so i have high hopes for what will come out next, but i must say that this film is pretty bad. I am not going to spoil anything, but let's get to the main point.|0
"There are many film now on DVD, but producers had forgotten some tittles of importance to many moviegoers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the era of the wide screen, big budget epics had merit. Many people from my generation learn a lot about history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas, (The first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure movie with Charlton Heston called The Treasure of the Incas), same happened to me with Egypt, or Rome seen many ""bad"" epics of the era."|1
Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in describing this as a riveting,fascinating and certainly beautiful film. It's not necessary to see all the episodes,since the first ones are the best,while the last ones are a-bit tiresome,but for any person who likes German's and their good-natured ways,all episodes are worth seeing.In typical german fashion, values are constantly questioned,even it's murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes, the rich dialogues are particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who is about to live or travel in Germany,preferably in original language!|1
This is the best movie I have ever seen. It has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate. And a deep friendship that not even war can destroy.The most splendid casting I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were top grade in this movie.If you see part 1 you will want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie.I am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that can get children to learn history is great.|1
Thank you Mario Van Peebles for informing us of not only the existence of black cowboys, but providing a compelling story that was easy to follow.The plot, backdrop, music and talent were all top notch. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the tale of the black cowboy. It was also good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Does he ever play a good guy?I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to broaden their way of thinking. This is an excellent movie and I feel privileged to have seen it.|1
Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, most clever, sharp-witted, sarcastic and heart-warming television shows I've ever watched, (second only to my most favorite television show of all time, F*R*I*E*N*D*S). The quick pace and many pop-culture references can leave some viewers confused, but once you catch on to the ways of the Gilmores, you'll be hooked for life. Just some random comments, I recently (finally) began watching Season 6 and wow! It's one of my favorite seasons so far.|1
`5 Years ago if you were to watch an Australian film you would expect to see crocodile hunters, stories of war, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas, and Australians in general being represented as nitwits living off the land, saying words like cobber' and generally being the classic underdog.Luckily Australian film has evolved over the last couple years and is churning out modern day classics' such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People.In this evolution of film we also find Two Hands.Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the rough end of town.|1
"This show is my absolute favorite . This show is intelligent , entertaining and always full of surprises . Lauren Graham is one of the most likable actors I have ever seen. She just has that look about her that says ""I love you"" and it shows when she walks off stage. If you need a good laugh in a dark room this is the show for you. Don't worry if you are not familiar with the book but this show is worth at least half a grade! The only reason I didn't give this show a 1 star was, well, its name."|0
I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience which shows up on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who had a vision and was able to capture the movie in the exact way we envisioned while prepping the film. The sets are amazing and well crafted for each character. John York and his team built sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well in shooting the film, allowing us to move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has an amazing arc, which makes for a great story.|1
"Tex Avery 's tenure as director of cartoons for MGM was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the greatest in the history of motion pictures. I have seen the original version of this cartoon from 1951, it is pretty much what it would be today. If you really like cartoons, or if you haven't seen them in quite a few years, then I highly recommend that you watch this one! MGM had a huge problem: they needed a new name for the animated feature. They picked the name ""Tangled"" and tried to sell it to every single kid in the country."|0
"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love."|1
On their way to a country house to hear a new play being read a theatrical producer, his secretary, and the playwright end up stuck in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, only to end up at the home of the playwright's fiance. If you can't guess that murder and mayhem are about to take place then you haven't been paying attention.This is a a good entry in the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good mystery, you also have some very funny one liners wandering through it.|1
"Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie."|1
"I got this movie with my BBC ""Jane Austen Collection"" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, ""My only acquaintance...tore my gown."""|1
"This film , released in 1951 , has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50 's and 60's. We get a young man (Ricard Guay) who runs from one trouble to the other after having been fired from his job for getting too hot under the collar. All this does is keep him busy, as he can't get a job anywhere. He takes a job working as a ""boy scout"" out in Nevada, where he lives with an Indian named Jack (John Wayne)."|0
...I saw this movie when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine, and today I still remember each black and white frame, especially the black ones, because it was so tense, scary, those sneaking attacks through that dark pass in the mountain, the two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other by their captors, the last battle with the uncovering of the wagon with the Gatling in it firing away, the last fight between Peck and the chief, and the Happy End which let me take back my breath.|1
The best bit in the film was when Alan pulled down her knickers and ran the cut throat razor over her bum cheeks and around her bum hole. It was also brilliant to see Alan's bum going up and down like a fiddler's elbow later on in the film.Alan was tough as hell in it like when he got annoyed and pushed the four eyed wimp onto the sofa.I've been laughing for days about the cut throat razor bit. A brilliant idea by the script writers. Alan must be brought back into Eastenders so he can do the same to Peggy.Alan is back, and this time he's armed with a razor.|1
If I'd only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as nurse' Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock.|1
In `` Black Snake Moan , '' writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that part of me wishes I were making this film, too. But there's not much left to talk about in this one, for the most part. In a scene where a Native American looks up out of his window and sees his mother standing at the front door, you don't even see his mother, just the window. So what happens when a movie like this is released on DVD? They make it into a huge hit and then release an inferior version which is nothing but rehashes of scenes from this film.|0
Just Before Dawn came out during the golden days of the slasher film. The backwoods slasher pretty much started with films like Friday the 13th, The Burning, and Madman. Just Before Dawn is a step ahead of the typical backwoods slasher flick. The cinematography is gorgeous. The acting is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical 'final girl'.Constance is a 'woods' girl, but when it comes down to the primal instinct of survival, she's a step behind. Not until it comes to saving the life of her and her boyfriend, does the primal notion of survival kick in.|1
This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official. Then he's a fugitive on the run. They later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide. Seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly.This was on odd film. I liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character murders a federal official.|1
"I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am . My brother and I were channel surfing and suddenly there was the opening credits for this movie. It seemed like it would be a good show-biz project but no, the script was too long, too boring and too predictable. There were no twists and turns, no laughs or tears. The acting was awful. It might have been cool if it hadn't been so slow moving.The story revolves around an alien called ""Mikaela"" who crash lands on Earth only to discover that it's actually a utopia full of high tech robots and super heroes."|0
for a movie like this little hidden gem to come out in the 80s , its shocking how not a thing was done about it ! This movie is very disturbing, I don't know where you are getting such ideas. This movie takes place at night. It does not seem to me to have been made in the same time frame as the previous ones. You have one scene that looks like a car crash on a highway; another that looks like some kind of an alien spacecraft crashing. One scene has a lot of blood and gore.|0
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching.|1
Bluff I really think this movie is very good.Is basic a different kind of Colombian movie. Is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen.It shows a different face o Bogotá and I think that's very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world This is the first movie of the director Felipe Martinez and I really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director.We need to continue support Colombian filming industry, because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big.|1
"""Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!"" ""Can you play dead?"" It's difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime dramedy. Where the bad cop is an ass. Literally. What's great about the show is some of Assy's perfectly awful one-liners. Cracking out such gems as ""Adios, Blimp,"" Assy Mcgee provides some great laughs at points. Sadly at other times, the show seems to drag along at a slow pace, making it almost hard to watch."|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller/comedy/road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) witnesses the brutal murder of her no-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre sort of amnesia, and flees in his car, not knowing that there is large stash of drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hit men who follow her.What Betty is chasing, besides a new beginning (although she can't remember the old life) is her beloved, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear).|1
MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that have stuck in my head over the years and finally decided to make a little animated feature out of it. The movie starts off as some guys are being chased down by a group of people trying to rob them. They don't seem to care about the robbers, at least none that I've seen so far. When they realize they are going to get shot at they try to call for help but all the calls are answered with static. The cops then show up and say that they are there to help (which doesn't actually help).|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends.|1
I 'm not usually into dark/psychological thriller type things . However , SEIZING ME is really an amazing piece of work and i think its one of the best films ever made. Its a very atmospheric film set in a world where you don't know who to trust, and what to be afraid of - and it does so in a very clever way.The plot is almost completely non-linear although there are some clues scattered throughout the picture. The movie has a very slow start but quickly picks up pace. The acting is excellent and I really love the cinematography.|0
I came across this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3 am. My brother and I were channel surfing and who do we see but a young Russel Crowe. But not the telephone throwing Russel Crowe we had come to know and quasi-love back in the states. This movie, much to my surprise, was amazingly creative and hilarious. It stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences, including a slick salesman,prostitutes, and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky enough to come across this film I would strongly suggest picking it up.|1
Sweeping drama with great sets, costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling Rhett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location. Splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end. Lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad. Secondary story lines also are well developed. Several cameos by major stars of past eras. Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics.|1
One of the best! As being a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. In watching this fabulous story unfold into a time never forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony, and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in the eighth grade. Being a young boy, you would think that I wouldn't have been interested in this civil war soap.|1
"Pat Conroy's autobiographical book ""The Water Is Wide"" proves to be something of a Southern ""Up The Down Staircase"", yet despite the teacher-going-against-the-odds formula, ""Conrack"" really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash. These students (uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown learning, and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet. The one actual actress in the bunch (Tina Andrews, an amazing performer) plays the ""tough nut"" Conrack has to crack, and once she falls under his charms, it all seems a breeze."|1
Yes, this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters, I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70's - and being a child/teen singing these songs and learning music - the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman.|1
This enjoyable Euro-western opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for ``The Last of the Mohicans.'' As I read the reviews of this movie, I thought to myself, 'I really don't understand them. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've heard people say it was written by Jerry Bruckheimer's son, who has never produced anything before. I don't get why people like this. It's just one big pile of crap.|0
"Forget about the plot of this movie . Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Jane Fonda , who are both amazing actors. They are both great performers, but they do nothing for a film that isn't entertaining to begin with . The acting was excellent, the special effects very cool. I would recommend this to any Star Trek fan! But don't even think of watching it because you have to pay $6 for the DVD release, which doesn't include an option to rent ""Star Trek IV"" on VHS."|0
Me and my roommate got free tickets for a Pre Screening I guess you would call it in Atlanta , we were very excited to do something different this year. There was a line around the block, so we waited outside the theaters for an hour and a half before we finally got inside. The theater was absolutely packed with people. One of my roommates even got into a fight with some guy that didn't let her get in. I've read other reviewers' reviews and there really wasn't anything new here.|0
Having read all of the comments on this film I am still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full screen restored version in DVD. Yes, the history may be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values alone merit a restoration and distribution. I saw this film in second grade and it triggered my lifelong interest in all things Egyptian, culminating in my visiting Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of film on a child's imagination, eh?|1
"One of the many backwoods horror 's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of them. This movie looks like it was filmed at a campfire. It is scary because all of the kids are so scared they can't even look up from their phones. ""I don't get why you bother with this show when I can have an episode of CSI on my DVR for only $2.50 a pop."" If you ever find yourself trapped in a small town by a monster that will kill you unless you save it, be prepared for a rather unpleasant surprise."|0
After `` Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman '' with Alison Hayes opened the doors for women to be just as sexually adventurous as men and there are countless female-themed comedies today. I wasn't very impressed with this movie. Not because I don't like comedy films, but because the story is so lame that it's hard not to feel bad for the characters.The plot isn't particularly original either. I guess it could've worked if the movie were based on real life. It also doesn't help that all of the male lead characters have some kind of character flaw which gives them an easy way in.|0
"Wow ! An amazing , lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70s glam-rock film rolled into one . This film should be required viewing for every Aussie and every Brit, especially if you're a die-hard rock-n-roll fan . ""LOST IN MELBOURNE"", THE GREATEST FILM EVER MOVED. It's really that bad. I mean, how many of these ""films"" are there? Are they all equally bad? Is this one an exception? The plot is terrible. The acting is abominable. The editing is horrible. The camera work is horrendous. The special effects are unbelievable."|0
When this film gets it right it really gets it right. And when it goes wrong... I'd say that a full 3/4s of the film is great. I can even isolate the bad bit. It's everything that has to do with the romance. Everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30. I'd recommend skipping that section if you can. It does nothing except explain his exile. It should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside.|1
"Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings . In Europe there are few movies that depict such depth of feelings. That's why I recommend watching this movie by yourself, it would help you understand more about real world.I'm sorry but what I mean by saying ""This movie is too bad"" was that it's hard to understand the film without some background information. So I hope you guys read the book as well. Hahahahaha! This movie was awful! I didn't enjoy it. It was lame and lacked any meaning for the plot."|0
Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years , until a group of jewelers managed to find her in Florence , Italy in 1517. This painting was probably painted by Leonardo da Vinci around 1470, although most scholars consider it to be a copy (see picture on left) . There are two possible explanations for this theft, either the Mona Lisa was stolen from a church, or she had been given as a wedding present by the Pope. A couple of years ago, I moved to New Zealand and was really enjoying the country.|0
"People need to give this show a chance . The people who write bad reviews ( there are very few) have no idea what the show is all about. It's been said that 'The Sopranos' can't be rated higher than one out of 10. I agree, it's extremely hard to rate such a series. But if you're not a hardcore fan of the show and want an objective review, check out my review of ""The Sopranos"". So what's the main problem with this movie?"|0
"This movie is Wonderful ! I can watch it again and again . Robin hood is Perfectly cast , and the story is well thought. This film is not just one or two characters ,but a great picture of England during the late 16th century.There is no need to see ""Romeo and Juliet"" or some other famous historical romance for this movie. A few years back I had watched this film with my parents. My mother said she was surprised by its length, and her disappointment was not as great as mine. It would have been so easy to watch this film in about 2-3 hours."|0
"I love to see a female protagonist, in this movie her name was Rose. Rose brought out a lot of interesting questions in her journey of fulfillment.Is is possible to attain peace and internal fulfillment through external means? Does our society teach this? Can one be a victim of memory which may lead to victimizing others? Is one responsible for being a product of one's environment? To what extent can one control or take control of one's environment? How is a ""typical"" human alike or different than Rose? Lastly, would the outcome or story change if it were from another country like France or Italy?"|1
What can you possibly say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works too with a large energetic cast seemingly enjoying themselves to the hilt and whilst one could wish for a re-mastered version, I guess we are lucky to even have this video transfer. Pretty much a delight throughout. There are a couple of slightly off moments but this could have been embarrassing all through and it certainly is not. It also could have been and today would have been too camp. No, a very fine effort that is amusing, tuneful and just sexy enough.|1
"Adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect . Here Alice is a little naive, and she has a rather odd idea about her own existence. She can't get rid of the ghosts that have haunted her life. When I first saw this adaptation of a children's book for the first time, I thought it was just one of those movies that had ""Saving Private Ryan"" all over them. However, after watching this movie for a few years, I've started to see that this movie was actually one of the best kids movies ever made."|0
It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of `` slasher '' movies in the early 1980 's , there would eventually be a genre like this. And I think, to some extent, it should have. There was no need to include horror elements in this film. No need for suspense. Nothing to indicate what was really going on. It's just pure exploitation. There are a lot of people who like these types of movies and enjoy them. Unfortunately, they also don't always make them right. This movie doesn't do it justice.|0
I have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one . I really ca n't come up with anything else. It is a shame that this film did not end on a higher note. I think there are two possibilities: 1) the director thought this film was too dark, or 2) he/she wanted to make it as a low-budget thriller. The truth is, I don't know which would be the case. To me, what is most striking about this film is that it is completely different from the original and yet still manages to be quite entertaining.|0
"This is definitely an excellent show . I do n't have cable , so I started renting them , because i wanted something to watch with a couple of people in our house who could talk about some stuff that happened in their lives. Well, after watching this show , for the second time , my friends and I just went back to our normal lives . It's really bad . There's no redeeming value here . The only good thing about this show is that they gave it two seasons . I had heard good things about this show on the ""TV Guide"" section of my local mall."|0
The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle almost seamlessly picks up where The Egg and I left off . We follow the two children through school, but soon realize they are in love. I watched this at the cinema a couple of weeks ago and I had to get another copy for my DVD player. The film is an example of how television can have so many drawbacks, but there's something special about it that makes it still worthwhile. It takes its time to set up and explore the different parts of each character, from the ditzy one-eyed boy to the more serious teacher.|0
"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see."|1
"I don't usually like to see movies while they're still in theaters because of high ticket prices but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, ""that young actress looks intelligent and mysterious, not like the usual blonde teenybopper BS"". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on it's opening night. I must tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this film with no expectations. I didn't really know what it would be about, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me feeling rather satisfied with my decision."|1
I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years . I rate it one of the worst movies ever made! I saw this movie last night and was so disappointed with it. It doesn't have to be that terrible, there are so many good comedies on TV today like Modern Family, How I Met Your Mother, The Soup, Friends...but this just plain sucks. I've never heard of this woman before. She's not even very nice. I didn't care who she was, but I did care if her character was funny.The acting was bad.|0
I'm not the biggest fan of westerns. My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven, and Tombstone. This movie though, I loved! It was great! The plot was well done, and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well, not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points.|1
Up And Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought a tool/and or channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people, and hope for change. I advise this selection for every American household to experience the struggle, and the reward. The show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle-class Blacks becoming business owners of their own. The issue's were so compatible with real life situation's that impacted the lives of so many.|1
Having grown up in the typing pool era and dealing with office politics and men who were apt to make things a lot worse by making it seem like they knew something, I am not one to jump on board the 'women are too stupid to do anything!' bandwagon. They have their place, they just don't have the skills or wherewithal to be of much value as an employee. I'm actually having a very hard time finding fault with this movie (aside from the fact that it is terrible).|0
"At first I could n't tell if it was an art film or a documentary . The day after I watched it i went to the movies to see what the fuss was about
I think this movie will suck, even if you don't care for the characters, and especially if you don't enjoy the acting. The plot is so lame that you can't get over it. I'd rather wait till next year when the movie will be re-released in theaters. My god... This movie just sucked. A few lines here and there? What a waste of time."|0
Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) to be funny as well. I just about threw up, but I guess that's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor.|1
It happens often , while growing up , a Hollywood movie impresses a youth . It not only lasts a few minutes , but the whole film seems to lose its shape . If you ever have any doubt that you will see a good film when you grow up , look into this ! One of the many reasons I am writing this review is so people who are interested can see the true, unexplainable depth of the problem. I'm sorry if you're an amateur filmmaker (like me) and do not want to waste your time trying to fix it.|0
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style."|1
i love this movie. is it on air anymore? what can i do to get it on air again because i miss this movie when does this movie air again? i love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since it was last on Disney?it has been a very very long time and i am so sick of waiting!i want to see Susie Q again. i swear, they take all the good movies off air and play new stupid gay ones that are fake and retarded.|1
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album.|1
Along with virtually every Republic Picture ever made , `` Murder in the Music Hall '' seems to have undeservably fallen into the camp of films which attempt to emulate the style of an earlier film such as John Ford's `The Searchers'. I think it is a very dumb movie.It was made in the 1970s and has no plot or characters at all. I am sorry, but that is all I can say.The main reason why I give this one three stars instead of four is because I find some of the acting ridiculous. There was nothing funny about this film.|0
"The film starts with promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two boys have fewer scenes together. This slows the pace considerably. Billie ""Buckwheat"" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left behind on the riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he goes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly rejected the viewer really begins to wonder if this is a comedy or not. Watching a children's birthday party through a picket fence is another moving moment."|1
This film was made soon enough after Karen 's passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen's death decided that they'd had enough and were going to go ahead and finish it off. I thought I had seen so many bad movies that I needed to find out more about them. Unfortunately, when I came upon this film a week or so ago, I was completely disappointed in it. The movie itself is not good. It's simply awful. The acting by the lead actors is terrible. There are many times where the audience can tell that these actors do not get along.|0
It 's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it 's either one thing or another. The premise is that the aliens are coming for Earth and the only people to stop them are Dr. Rorschach, who's been turned into a zombie (which isn't a good enough reason). In other words, the movie is based on a book by William Peter Blatty. However, there is not one character in the movie who ever appears in the book except for someone who has a cameo in the novel.|0
I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult . To say that is even remotely accurate would be saying the plot of this movie was a little boring, but then again it doesn't have anything to do with the main story line at all. If you want to understand why I'm so upset about this movie then I think you will find it by looking at the reviews for this DVD. That said I will give it 4 stars because I thought the script was good (although it wasn't).|0
"My family and I normally do not watch local movies for the simple reason that they are poorly made , and by 'poorly' I mean ""filmed on a $1,000 budget"". The last time we saw it was in 1985. This time around there are only a few scenes of any relevance to the real story of this film, as far as I can recall. This movie should have been a masterpiece. Instead it is like an overworked, underpaid, underprivileged person who happens to be rich decides to turn their life around and make it work for everyone else."|0
comeundone, I love you! I could not have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it's ending. My family has not seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time, I watched it alone and I found that it affected me greatly. Although the movie is long in length, I was tied to the story and amazed by the ending. I initially thought it was weird as to how she just vanished, but on some level, it makes perfect sense.But like comeundone said, this movie does not make sense of reality.|1
"Style over substance . But what a style it is . `` The Cell '' is the internal version of the TV series, and not to be confused with the film , which also uses the same name. This time, however, there is no good reason why such a show should exist at all; indeed, one has to wonder how this was even possible in the 1980's (or even now).The plot is that a group of young people who have never seen each other before meet for the first time and realize that they are not ""friends""."|0
Surprising, witty, funny and totally engaging, the film grabs a little-known reality: that of the student that goes studying in an Erasmus program. The beginning is great, as the story kicks off, of course it has a few lulls on the midsection, and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother - the movie is young, fresh, and light-hearted, even though I don't agree with the notion that when you do Erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe. But that's just me.|1
Im a die hard Dads Army fan and nothing will ever change that. I got all the tapes, DVD's and audiobooks and every time i watch/listen to them its brand new. The film. The film is a re run of certain episodes, Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School and numerous others with a different edge. Introduction of a new General instead of Captain Square was a brilliant move - especially when he wouldn't cash the cheque (something that is rarely done now).It follows through the early years of getting equipment and uniforms, starting up and training.|1
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film. It was when I was a teenager, I think (I'm 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie sometime in the mid to early 80s, and so much of it has stayed with me ever since. Seeing other comments, I had NO idea it was shown at theatres, or that anyone else even new it existed. I don't think I've even mentioned the movie to anyone else.But half a lifetime later, I still remember much of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago.|1
Every time I hear Karen Carpenter's voice, there is that old familiar feeling of 70's blues. What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had. Cynthia Gibb cast in the title role does a good job, however, I thought Karen Allen would have been a better choice. This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Karen and Richard but also the personal struggles that Karen dealt with and her disease. The recording sessions in Herp Albert's studio are very nicely done.|1
"i love this movie . is it on air anymore ? what can i do to get it on air ? I was not impressed by this film, I've seen some very good movies over the years, but this film wasn't one. The acting was terrible, and the story was a total mess.The movie starts off with the idea that these people have all become insane and are being held captive in a small island by a group of men known as ""The Island"" (we don't see them until the first 30 minutes of the movie, so they could have only been brought there by force)."|0
One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No major stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most everything he appears, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. Matching him is Ward Bond as the crusty Mormon elder leading his people west. John Ford's stock of character actors, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, provide ample support, as does eerily silent James Arness, a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train.|1
This was such a great series for Black folks at the time . We loved it so much . It really showed us all that we couldn't be anything other than what we truly were in the black community . That show made us realize how big of a world we live in and how important it is to support those who are working hard to bring about change . To know that there are many of us out there going through life who have no choice but to strive every day to better myself and my family.|0
"Strange enough, shorts like this get a 10. Why? They are hilarious. This is hilarious. Notice a lot of the quirky humor. Dated and childish to toon naysayers, but they don't know what they're talking about. They got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids. The art in this is probabley the best non-Road Runner art of the 1950's Looney Tunes shorts. It's hard to come across something better than the art in ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"", although nothing ever will. This probabley runs a close 3rd or 2nd."|1
Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films , In The Company of Men & Your Friends, and this time around the main characters are different people and their relationship is much deeper. It works really well since it gives you a chance to feel for all the characters that have been involved in this case.The acting is good and there are some very nice moments but overall I am not sure if this movie is worth your money. If you're looking for an action movie, watch Lethal Weapon 3 instead.|0
"Okay I marked this spoiler so don't be upset when I wrap this up. Now I went into the movie expecting to see a very predictable movie. And I was right, as almost every horror flick I have ever seen it was predictable but not as bad as most. What helped was the story, I did not expect there to be a ""WHY"" to Kane's madness. But there was and while somewhat foggy you still got the idea and understand the madness. Now of course if you like something that will scare you for nights to come this is not the movie your looking for."|1
The Box is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it.|1
Enjoyable film that gives you romance , women-on-the-verge psychodrama , work place sexual harassment , adultery , and fashion . However, I can see why many people may be disturbed by it. It was supposed to be funny. I laughed at a few of the lines in the film. A couple of things about the script: 1) In real life, there is no such thing as a man on the verge of murdering a woman. 2) All the women in this film are either fat, ugly, crazy or have some sort of mental condition that renders them incapable of giving a decent blow job.|0
King of Queens is comic genius. Kevin James, whom plays IPS deliveryman Doug Heffernan is extremely funny, Leah Remini who plays Doug's wife Carrie is incredibly hot ( # 19 on Stuff magazine's hottest 102 woman list ), and very funny. The true magic of the show However is the scenes with Jerry Stiller, they are the funniest in the show. Jerry, a comic genius, plays Carrie's father, Arthur Spooner, whom lives in Doug and Carrie's always cold basement. I must admit that I never watched this show until this year, 2006.|1
I saw the Messiah:- The First Killings and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programmes I have seen, ever. It was one of those programmes that you think that oh, no, I cannot watch the rest of this but you feel compelled to watch it just to see who done it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely amazing actor in it, to be able to switch between two totally, totally different characters one of which is the evil, nasty person that did it and the other person who is Jez Clifton, the cop.|1
15 Park Avenue , well the name mystifies initially being an address from New York and film being set in New York. It was actually one of the most important movies of the twentieth century due to its political impact. The main plot revolves around an American-born Russian who is captured and tortured by the Nazis during WW2. We are then given a synopsis about his life, which at the end has been altered. This movie could be great if the characters were likable and interesting. A lot of these people just don't seem to have any depth.|0
(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man. After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home.|1
Honestly, when I went to see this movie at the Rave theater in Plainfield Indiana, I did not expect much. I went to this movie only because I figured hey, it's a WWE movie it'll be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched it and saw why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He is probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage to other movies that attracts me to a horror movie.|1
A classic late 50 's film . The superannuated headliners ( Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan ) are not at all the same as what we've been accustomed to. Crawford's eyes are more open, she has an impassioned delivery, and her character is a bit more likeable. If you don't know about this movie yet, I want you to watch it again before you write a review. I recommend that you get into it while you still can. It is a masterpiece of American cinema from its very first appearance on the scene in 1932.|0
"then you will be a big fan of this movie . Its almost the same basic concept , a nice old lady who has been abused by her step-father in the past, tries to get some peace and reconciliation back.The problem here is there is not really any ""resolution"" for the relationship. We know that she loves her father very much, but does not have the same feelings for him as she had for her mother. I would have given this movie less than a 1 if it wasn't for the beautiful cinematography."|0
"My favorite film this year . Great characters and plot , and the direction and editing was smooth , visually stunning. I had a bad experience watching this in Australia and I can't remember why. There are many people that complain that this is an ""adventure film"" and I don't believe it. It is a thriller at heart, but one that also has a strong psychological undertone. I've always been amazed at the amount of hype about these movies. I never understood why filmmakers spend so much money on marketing their movies and then turn around and do very little promotion."|0
A remarkable film , bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings I had when I was much , much younger. It brings back memories of the late 60's, but with a new twist. Myself, my family, and friends could not agree on what was right and what was wrong! The story of this movie is that a bunch of teenagers get together for a night of drinking and debauchery at an isolated cabin owned by a crazy old man named Jim (the only one in the movie who actually makes any real sense). The result is chaos and insanity.|0
I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south . The story follows a small town couple who has their house burglarized. I know this is not the first movie made about a serial killer but its still an awful film. If you haven't seen one before don't waste your time, its nothing special. Every single character are annoying, there's nothing to care about. The acting is horrendous as it seems that they had no experience of working with other actors. This film also doesn't contain any plot whatsoever.|0
"This if the first movie I 've given a 10 to in years . If there was ever a movie that really needed more than 2 minutes to get started it's one of these.If you want to know how bad the script is you will find out when you watch the movie. ""It's boring and pointless"" - as an ex-policewoman once told me, before she threw herself under the bus! (I couldn't help but laugh at the fact)
First off, let me give some credit to the production company. There is no way I would be able to produce a movie like this on my own."|0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short. Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a read through. The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script. The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental. Less is much better in this case.|1
`` Jaded '' takes on the complex question of abuse : the perpetrators and the victims . In lesser hands this movie might never have been allowed on television, because it is a far too long (and very confusing) movie to allow you to enjoy it. I saw this film at an open air theater near my home last weekend and was rather disappointed with how bad it was. I watched it for about 45 minutes and had no idea what the movie was about at all. I thought it sounded more like a children's story or a low budget horror movie.|0
"When I watch a short like Boy-Next-Door, I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I'm watching something that has been well thought out, seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting. On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced. TV and films are so consistently packed with easy, condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the ""benefit"" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem."|1
I think that Mario Van Peebles movie Posse is a very important film. It is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of. This is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen returning from the Spanish-American War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane.|1
1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best tales of wilderness horror out there. It's one of the finest-made slashers of the 80's and it easily blows movies like The Final Terror, Don't Go in the Woods, or The Prey out of the water.A group of young adults come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However they are not alone in the wild. A hulking in-bred murderer, who seems to be in two places at once, is lurking and apparently hates trespassers.|1
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin. There aren't much left when it arrives. Not of the train and not of some passengers.This is a black comedy directed by Peter Dalle and acted like they used to act in the 40s and also photographed (in b/w) like they used to during that period. The actors must have had lots of fun making it. They aren't much of characters, like they weren't in the 40s, but the story is well narrated and everybody has timing.A deadly black and deadly funny film.|1
"After Mrs and Mr. Iyer this is yet another very good film by Aparna sen(mostly in English). In the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals. In this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on ""reality"". It is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film.Mithee the younger sister (Konkana Sen Sharma, the daughter of Aparna Sen) is suffering from Schizophrenia being taken care of by the dominant elder sister Anjali (Shabana Azmi) ."|1
The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can anyone tell me how I can get hold of the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that's not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to look up amazon.com but its not there. I tried CD baby, not there either. I browsed through Google to get some details but there weren't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question.|1
This movie is a piece of the time in which it was made ..... Realistic . Movies were not candy for me back in those days.. I don't get why people are surprised that I am into such things. I have not seen this movie since I was 8 years old.... I saw it because my brother and I had some friends over and decided to watch this movie together..... It was about a family living in a small ranch house on the outskirts of town. The house has no telephone and no television, there is also no running water at the house.|0
I got this movie with my BBC `` Jane Austen Collection '' ( 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations ) and I just couldn't believe that they had made this film. I bought this on DVD and it was NOT good. If you like Jane Austen, this is the best one you could buy for £6.99. The acting is not great. The music is horrible. The story sucks. The plot is totally stupid. The characters are all stupid.The story is completely unnecessary and the acting is very bad. It's a really bad movie if you want to get a sense of the author and the world.|0
I get really fed up with sitcoms ; you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be a comedy or drama. I am very surprised that this movie doesn't get any nominations for best actor or actress...it was such a shock to me because I had been anticipating seeing this movie after watching the trailer at least 2 times before seeing it in cinemas. It looks like a great script and the cast are all very good, but I just can't see anyone being able to make a decent movie out of this kind of material.|0
These guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class. The musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it throughly!! I was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in Houston, TX and was blown away. I have not missed a show since power windows and I have to say that they are better than ever.|1
"As I was reading through the comments, I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was ""not very profound."" I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters, beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die."|1
"Watching The Wagonmaster is not likely to result in deep thoughts , unlike many other great Ford films , like the classic The Searchers . I was very disappointed by the movie. The director and his team obviously have too much time on their hands for something that has no redeeming characteristics at all. The only good aspect about The Wagonmaster lies in the fact that the film is full of memorable scenes, such as ""The Hunchback"", ""The Mule"" and more. It's just too bad that so many of them are completely forgettable. I thought this film would be fine."|0
"It came before ""the ten commandments"" ""land of the Pharaohs"" ""Ben Hur"" and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel ,it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari,whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books ""the secret of the kingdom"" (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land)."|1
A talented high school graduating senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for an attractive local girl she helps him realize he has a shot at a 'full ride' scholarship if he plays well.All too often, these dramas fall into formulaic traps and tell the same old story of a troubled and confused teen. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo certainly fits this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre.|1
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about. Or, maybe it isn't: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals. But this is just the broadest stroke. It's a feat that you either surrender yourself to, or you don't. He gets into the form of the world around him entirely, without a story, bound only to certain aspects of written poetry, as his camera (shooting on supposedly discarded film stock) wanders like in a pure travelogue.|1
I caught this as part of the Cartoon Noir package at the Clinton Street Theater in Portland , and it wasn't bad. I think the only thing that made this film go from terrible to truly awful was a scene where a character goes into a restroom on her own and comes back out crying. Very disappointing. The movie starts out with a montage of all the bad parts of the '60s (such as John Wayne's divorce, the Vietnam War etc..) and then we see one of the worst things to happen to the world - nuclear winter.|0
Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential.|1
One of the best ! As being a fan of the civil war , I was very pleased with the show that aired last night and it was really good . I was so glad they had the original cast back for the new series and I am sure this one will be better than the worst . This is an old classic, but if you're in the market for a sitcom (especially for late night) or even just to get your brain moving after a long day's work, start at the beginning. The story has some interesting ideas here, but the writing is not quite up to snuff.|0
"This probably ranks in my Top-5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I was not a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was a lot different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIOUS! I was extremely pleased with how well it was put together, and how well acted it was! Besides Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; ""We're Men in tights!"""|1
"Having just got the ""Loony Tunes Golden Collection""(which i HIGHLY recommend, by the way), I'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons individually. As such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them, for this i apologize.Rabbit Seasoning is the middle short in a trilogy of like-minded shorts (the other two being ""Rabbit Fire"" and ""Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Bags and Daffy argue about who Elmer Fudd should short. It makes me laugh EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!"|1
"This was another great episode from season 11 of South Park . Cartman fakes having Tourette syndrome in order to find out the truth about Stan, but it backfires and he goes off the deep end. The only thing that really stands out from this episode is Cartman's fake mustache. He must have spent hours trying to replicate this look. Not exactly what I expected from one of the more ""funny"" shows on TV. The story line is very predictable. In a nutshell, Randy is kidnapped by an evil scientist who claims that his cure for cancer will cure everyone."|0
I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside.|1
One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eightes and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes it has a cheesy plot but I was pleasantly surprised at this film, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob.First of all, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is, who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous. But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway.|1
I 'm not the biggest fan of westerns . My two personal favorites though are Unforgiven , and Tombstone . I loved Tombstone but I'm really torn on Unforgiven . I've always been a huge fan of Westerns. This one is definitely my fave. If you haven't had the chance to see it, then do yourself a favour and check it out, because it is well worth watching. John Wayne is the most overrated actor in Hollywood today. The guy doesn't have enough talent to even be cast in this role.|0
Awww, I love this! The Tale of the Cat and the Moon doesn't really need an synopsis, as that's what it is... the cat chasing the moon, to a Spanish poem. It's the artistry that's interesting. In fact, there was this animated short called the Fan and the Flower that was an Academy Award winner last year (2005)... yeah, almost same thing, which leads me to believe it might just be a rip off.But this is a really good short, with stark black & white shapes shifting and transitioning into beautiful motion and poetic seduction...|1
I'm not the type of person to watch T.V. shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or TOO dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She takes pride in wanting to attend Harvard and boys/boyfriends always come second in her book. She's a loyal friend and always the peace maker.|1
I haven't seen a film in a long time that moved me and gripped me in such a way; that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was busting for the loo; and I didn't even want to pause it because I was drawn right in. Emotive; powerful; very moving; horrific and heart-breaking. It gives you an amazing insight to South Africa; their struggles and their lives. The acting by the leads were mind-blowing and the script was incredible. Despite the terrible events that unfold in this film and how horrific the story is; I was captivated.|1
Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst John Ford's work. Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay, and because of director's personal opinion regarding it, Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which `came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve', to say so is not to say a little, but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson, his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.|1
Being an avid Carpenter Fan , I really loved this film ( although the wigs do leave a lot to be desired ) but was extremely disappointed with the ending. This movie just doesn't work.The premise is very interesting and the screenplay is good. However, everything after the halfway point starts to unravel. Everything that should have been explored or explained at the beginning slowly fades off into nothingness until we get to the end and then it's gone.I was expecting more of the same from this movie. It looks nice on paper but what happened to those great cinematography and lighting?|0
The first thing I wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again (because I'd missed lots with all the laughing I did). I'm European and I've studied abroad and I've as good as lived with Spanish, french, Italian and German people. The film was full of stereotypes, which, more often than not, p*** people off, and reading some of the other reviews I see that it did p*** people off. But, this film gets the stereotypes so right I cannot fault it.|1
Whoever cast this movie was a genius, every character in it is perfect for their part, and they all do an absolutely excellent job in their parts. This is a good glimpse of what life was before & during the civil war, the difference between the wealthy, the average whites, and the black people. The story gives you some insights as to the real issues of the era, and the difficulties that were inherent in everyday living back in those days. The storyline is compelling, and the drama keeps your attention through the entire movie.|1
The Lone Ranger & Tonto set out to bring to justice a band of hooded raiders who have killed three Native Americans. But when the movie begins to move in the direction of the film's climax, it quickly loses its steam. This is not a great movie. It is one of those films that you want to watch from beginning to end but don't. This is because there is very little dialogue and the acting is pretty terrible. You are supposed to be impressed by the fact that a group of people with no respect for each other could come together to commit murder on their own accord.|0
I love this film (dont know why it is called Pot Luck in England - what a rubbish, and entirely irrelevant name! ), I spent 8 months in Barcelona, not as an Erasmus student but living with other foreigners, so it felt just the same. It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries, and of the city itself. I really want to see the followup 'Les Poupees Russes ' (the Russian Dolls), I'm guessing it wont be released here?|1
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of `` Rawhide '' Charles Marquis Warren . The film takes place during the Civil War. The movie starts out with an older man who decides to join the ""Boys of Liberty"" in their cause to defeat the Northern aggressors. He soon finds himself in a lot more trouble than he expected after discovering that his family is planning to flee to freedom. This leads to some very funny character development for young Henry Hill as he gets to know the old man better."|0
When this show first came on the air , I saw it once or twice and thought it was another generic comedy. Fast forward to today, I just found out that it's actually not funny at all (not that there is any other way of showing what a terrible show it truly is), and for some weird reason, people keep turning around to watch it whenever it comes on. So if you're wondering where they've been since then, well, in the trash. This show is so stupid. Why would anybody even watch this garbage?|0
"Ok, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy/western movies. But that's because it didn't have the FUNDING those movies had. Obviously, whenever you want to produce a story such as this one, focusing on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and 'mammies' are not historical involvement), Hollywood isn't going to be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors sacrificed a lot of 'out of pocket' expenses to make ""Posse"", just so that the story could be told. I think that alone is commendable."|1
People need to give this show a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who haven't seen many episodes. One needs to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All of the characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but they are REALISTIC mistakes, which is an uncommon thing to see on television today. Also, for the most part the acting is superb. Lauren Graham has been snubbed of an Emmy for six years now.|1
A lot about USA The Movie can be summed up in its title. It draws parallels between the attitudes of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood-like falseness that glorifies things that shouldn't be glorified. I'm not sure I agree with the filmmaker's take on recent events (although, truthfully, I can't always tell exactly where he stands) but I admire the unusual and artistic way of getting the point across. Audio tracks of speeches, radio interviews, poetry etc. play as large a role here as visuals.|1
"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun."|1
Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing that it 's rabbit season . But after the first few months, they're all gone and there's only one deer in town. Now what? I never understood why people loved this movie until I read a review by a guy on here who said he saw this movie yesterday and it ruined his weekend. The movie is pretty good and if you like Bugs Bunny and are looking for a good comedy then this might be something you'll like. It seems like the writers forgot to give Charlie Chaplin any credit.|0
I saw this film on TV in the UK some 25 years ago and it has resonated with me ever since.The acting is good and the plot is believable. The main problem that I had with the film was the lack of direction. There were so many scenes that were pointless, confusing and uninteresting. As someone who has seen this movie at least a dozen times (probably more than that, I'm sure), I could not understand why people gave it 4 out of 10 stars. I've seen other movies which have scored as low as a 2 or 3 stars, but this was just plain awful.|0
I can barely even remember what DECADE I saw this film . It was when I was a teenager , not that it matters , and my parents sent it to our local video store on VHS with a promise that if they didn't give it away, it would be at our daughter's house. (I still think about that tape to this day .) Anyway , the movie itself has nothing to do with Christmas, and we don't need another excuse to make people feel guilty for enjoying something they weren't born to like.|0
this is a really great series . i love the show and i am so glad it is n't canceled by the tv channels.the only thing i can say with respect to the rest of the series is that this should be in high def, not low def like some of their other projects.my only complaint is that you can't get the subtitles on the DVD's. if anyone wants to help fix that problem they are more then welcome to send me a link to the subtitles for the episodes that you want translated. I'm sure they will do a good job of translating!|0
"I saw ""The Reader"" at a film festival in Manhattan this week. It touched my heart in a way that few short films have done. In ten or so minutes, it tells a poignant two-character story that resonated deeply with me. Duncan Rogers has done a superb job capturing very real, tender moments on film. What I really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format. These are genuinely interesting characters, and their story is told in the perfect length of time. This is no small feat."|1
` Skenbart ' is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Peter Dalle but from the likes of Joe Dante and John Candy as well. You will laugh your ass off at this flick. Dolores Haze has some very strong acting skills, but it's what she talks about that makes the movie so good! She's not afraid to say what needs to be said and in a very realistic way. As an audience, we can see what her real thoughts are and what she actually feels. That's a pretty impressive achievement for any actress.|0
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route."|1
For those who still prefer films focusing on human relationships , 51 Birch Street is a must see.By training the viewer's mind to accept and even like everything that happens in it, this can get very frustrating. It has some of the better performances in recent years, but as a movie it falls pretty far short of greatness. This was my first foray into film criticism, so I don't know if I've written this review right or wrong. However, I should be commended for being aware of what I'm writing.|0
"Ignore the bad reviews on here, this film is awesome! ""Just Before Dawn"" is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew, decent script, and a cool idea for a film. It's a hell of a lot of fun.I enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique. ""Wrong Turn"" ripped this movie off something fierce! There's plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch."|1
I 've been waiting almost 25 years to see this hard to find horror thriller and I finally did since it's been on sale for a long time now! I'm glad that my friend helped me out with this movie so we could enjoy it instead of going to see it, but I wish the DVD would be released as soon as possible.The movie begins with a man being abducted by an alien that turns him into an ape. This ape is able to have sex with men but does not allow any women to be affected.|0
"The philosophical , meditative tone of this movie renders it one of a kind . I 'd give it 10 stars, but then I would have to spend every waking hour and day watching it. There were several scenes in the movie that I thought were very cool (the scene where they go to see an old love for the first time after many years). But what was most disappointing about the whole movie is that all of them were completely unrealistic. For instance, when they're talking on the plane, the female pilot says things like: ""How do we ever get back to Japan?"""|0
Even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series, its coming to DVD was a blessing for all time. North and South truly is a series about friendship,love,honor... you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series. I can still remember the first time I caught a glimpse of this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I though wow this looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see book one and two on TV in the Netherlands.|1
"There's a brand new killer on the loose, and he's doing God's work. Yeah right! This killer makes Jason Voorhes look like a chump, and Freddy Krueger look like a rag doll against this dude. He is Jacob Goodnight(WWE's Glen ""KANE"" Jacobs), a 7' monster who wields a Axe, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him his real finisher is ripping out eyeballs from the victims sockets. That is totally methodical! When the encounter happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a rookie cop and maimed the veteran after putting a bullet in his head."|1
"I 'm absolutely disgusted this movie is n't being sold . All who love this movie should email Disney and tell them to stop putting it out. I can not believe that people like this ""film"" and are willing to pay big bucks for it. The fact that it's being advertised by Disney in their own movies is just disgusting. They should be banned from advertising at Disney World!! I wish they would get sued or something. This film is simply atrocious. It's one of those movies that have a bad beginning, a bad ending and no redeeming quality.The story is nonsensical and ridiculous."|0
In December 1945 a train leaves the central station of Stockholm for Berlin . There are n't much left when this train arrives, and the passengers decide it would be a great idea to sleep in the trains car. But they also decide it would be a great idea to watch some movie on TV.. There is no reason for this film to have been filmed in 1946-47...it should have been set during the Nazi period (1939-45). In fact there was a film made that could have been shot during the Nazi era but it went unproduced.|0
"I watched the first few moments on TCM a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes. I saw it listed on the schedule at the Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, and I vowed I would make the 40 minute drive. The Stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut Yes, they have curtains. They opened as the Fox logo fanfare began to play. When ""The Best of Everything"" appeared in huge pink letters spread against the New York City skyline, I knew I was right for waiting.I lapped this movie up."|1
"As I was reading through the comments , I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was so bad that I'm glad it wasn't a part of ""the good movies"" they made up. To me, that is the worst possible thing in the world. I had heard a lot about it but never bothered to see it myself. My first thought upon seeing this film was ""oh god why do they keep putting out these crappy trashy movies?"" The only reason for me checking it out was that I read the reviews and came across it on IMDb."|0
"My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own and I have a weak spot for crazy horror, slasher flicks and See No Evil happens to be exactly that and more!! I think that the biggest mistake made by producers and film makers of this film is that they hype it as a WWE film and ""starring"" KANE. WWE might have a big following but it's a very, very specific group that follow the incredibly cheesy and (sorry folks) kind of trailer park ""sport"" and those who don't love it HAATTTE IT!!"|1
I saw this movie when I was a lot younger but it captured me . I loved Orry and George's relationship and also how they grew up. But I don't remember the plot very well. There was so much going on that the only thing that made sense was Orry's father who couldn't be involved in the situation he found himself in or his death. This was a pretty bad movie. A few things were interesting, but other than that it was boring. We have to keep reminding ourselves that most of these films aren't even good, but for whatever reason this one was terrible.|0
In my opinion dads army is thee best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode, (this include the movie) You must at least watch a series of this show, get inside the characters, become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in. When you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you. Now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing, but it still works.|1
Most of these reviews are dead on , so I 'll cut to a different chase and answer a couple of the questions you guys may have. What was the inspiration? Why did they write this film? And if it was an inspired movie, were the actors acting that way in real life? This is an extremely poorly conceived film.The premise sounds good, the director says he wants something like that but what does that mean exactly? The plot seems to have been rushed into production without a solid concept. The acting is atrocious, from the lead actress to her co-stars to everyone else in the cast.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker. This is the only flick that I know of that Tarsem Singh has directed but boy was it intense. This movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind.The characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration. This movie compares to no other I have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd. In that respect it is a fairly large step above `A Clockwork Orange.'|1
I shot this movie . I am very proud of the film . It was a great experience which shows me to my own self how hard it is to get something made anymore. Told in flashbacks, the story follows a young boy who discovers that he is the heir to a powerful family and his childhood friend dies in a tragic accident. He finds out from his wife that the death was a suicide attempt. When their daughter mysteriously disappears after a trip to see her father, they go on a search to track down the missing girl.|0
"I like movies that show real people ""Americans"" and tell truth. The movie is simple and that seems to be the great thing about it. It played here in Norway fine (Amazon says above that it's USA/Canda but the box states ""All Regions"". I have to say it is not for the American viewers. It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. See it and you will like it or maybe hate it."|1
The entire series , not just The Blue Planet , is nothing short of amazing . The best nature series I have ever watched, and one of the most beautiful to boot. The only thing this series had going for it at all was a lousy plot that took place over a large geographical region. If you are one of those people who likes to sit around in a darkened room all day, waiting for the sky to light up, or the sun to shine on you, then you will probably enjoy this series.|0
Brilliant film! I am sorry to say that it resembles to me a bit like Pulp F. but thats how it is with post pulp era. Many pictures get automatically likened to it for only being a gangster flick. But this one is well written, funny coincidences, ordinary gangsters who are family men, resemble something from Tarantino, which is a good similarity!Anyway the film's about a guy bloke in Australia which is getting mixed up with a hard- core crime gang, and ends up in a debt and deep s*it.|1
My taste in films continues to astound me and probably infuriate readers of my reviews but to each their own.I watched this movie last night and I was really looking forward to getting through the plot, however I found myself saying to myself 'you know what, you don't need to worry about a plot here. You are not watching a bad movie here'. In fact I can honestly say this movie was quite good and well written. The characters were funny, they didn't get along all that well and I had a very good time laughing out loud during the whole movie.|0
A rather charming depiction of European union beginning to operate among the young generation as representatives of that group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, where they are all studying on international fellowships. Central to the story is Xavier ( Romain Duris),who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in France, but who quickly becomes a leader in the group, helping them deal with landlords and other problems. He learns about life and love rapidly. Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance. The rest of the cast also play well.|1
I have n't seen this movie since it came out at a drive in theater , and I have been away from the medium for years. It is not my favorite of the Bollywood trilogy, but it was also not my least favorite of the three.This is probably the weakest link in that trilogy. The plot is very simplistic and lacks depth to any degree. There are some good characters and even though many are unappealing, I thought they were all interesting. What could possibly be the worst film ever made? I don't want to talk about what it is, I'd rather just see it.|0
"i really love this movie , i saw it for the first time when i was working a video store. when i went to buy it they told me it was out of print and i couldn't order it so i just today thought i would look. and then i found it they put it out in Spain on DVD under the name ""Algo Mas Que Amigos"" and you can buy there it is in English and Spanish on the DVD....hope this helps ..... i know how hard it is to find movies that we love that they haven't Released to The U.S Market."|1
"The Hookers was to me a great everyday people story , Like someone you might have known . Just trying to be positive in a sad world. I didn't want to see it come across as ""we're just another group of rich, arrogant spoiled kids from New York City who think they are better than us""
There are so many terrible things in this film. First of all, I have to say that the entire plot is completely uninspired. In fact, one of the main reasons I thought about giving this movie a zero was the horrible acting."|0
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School."|1
I viewed The Reader at Sugar , which is not an optimal venue for viewing anything , and the movie was a disappointment . This film has some good characters in it, but the plot is so weak I had to leave. There are some really interesting moments of music in this film, however there were very few of them. For all the negative things people have said about this one, let's talk about the positives.The story is actually quite gripping. It started out promisingly, as we meet a group of misfits from New York City who go on a road trip through America.|0
I thought this film was amazing and I laughed so much that I had to see it twice to catch the bits I missed whilst bending over holding my stomach! The critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ over their shoe size to find this film funny, well my IQ is approx:135...I challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words! This film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot, he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant!!|1
"I saw this movie back in 1954 on a double-bill with `` Valley of the Kings . '' These movies were quite possibly the two worst films ever made at the RKO studios, even though neither one was technically a ""sequel."" This is a poor attempt at making a western and if you don't believe me just ask yourself what the big bucks are for such a thing? I had high hopes of seeing a more original western, but it's obvious that the writer(s) of this were simply out to cash in."|0
"This is a luminously photographed and unusually well-written western by veteran creator of ""Rawhide"" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is its chief help in this regard. Its strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. A hard-nosed by-the- book, Cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures a leader of the Indian enemy after a massacre at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back for trial, to be sent toTucson; his commander sends another man to try to take the prisoner for trial and the patrol is wiped out."|1
"North and South is a miniseries from the ""golden age"" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history.James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances--especially Read, whose George Hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story."|1
"I ca n't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has gotten . To be honest , I saw it when it was on sale at a big box retail store for $10. It had a good reputation in the early 1990s so I don't really care what people think about it since I am not from there. So let's jump right into it :-
The opening title sequence gives off the vibe of something that will never get past the basic concept stage, and by the second minute, you just can't tell what they were trying to do."|0
This film blew me away . I thought I knew a little about the Attica prison riot . After watching this film it was very clear to me that what they did there, and the people who were in it, didn't have any regard for human life at all. This movie has nothing going on but a lot of black people being mugged and shot. I'm not sure why anyone would waste their time seeing this movie. There isn't even a single bit of action or adventure. I don't think I'll see another movie like this again.|0
Hands down , the best drama/comedy show on television . A cleverly written show about a young mother and her teenage daughter.The only problem is that it never got past the pilot stage . So what we get instead of a good show is a bad show . The acting is not great and there are some pretty bad jokes thrown in. I'm an old fan of this show but I've never watched it with kids or adults. My son recently watched with his friends who loved it so much he begged me to see it with them.|0
there's only so much that i can take of Filipino films, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy(which i hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus. It's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great, especially the cinematography. i think that Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there's only so few Filipino movies that i really like. i think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this movie.|1
"This game is very good for the n64 . You can skate as Tony Hawk , Bob Burnquist , Steve McQueen and lots more .The gameplay is really good . I played it a month after it came out. One of the reasons I got this game has nothing to do with the storyline, but rather because it was the first ""video game"" from Activision. I am not so sure about the storyline, but the graphics were pretty good for a Nintendo 64 game at the time. This game does have some issues, the biggest being the camera in the background that moves left and right while you're skating."|0
"I'm a fan of independent film. Dialogue driven, character study pieces are where it's at for me. Some of the other posts are right: ""Wannabes"" isn't going to rival ""The Godfather"" for best mob film ever. On the other hand, ""Wannabes"" is a well-written and well-directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor/actress. My problem with one of the other reviews:- Conor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians- Dubin is a Jewish last name, and as such has a dark complexion, not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman."|1
"It has been recorded that John Ford made the ""big, blockbuster"" movies so that he could afford to make the ""small"" movies that he loved so well. Wagon Master, with a young Ben Johnson, is clearly one of his best, if not the best of his small movies. The location shooting, the wagons, the intricate work with horses, and the inclusion of the plains Indian are all trade marks of Ford. As in many of his other films, Eisenstein, the great Russian director's influence is seen in this film."|1
"""Jaded"" takes on the complex question of abuse: the perpetrators and the victims. In lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for direct-to-video. This director, however, has managed to pull off a textured multi-layered study with a decidedly different point of view.Given the fact that the director/writer is a woman and the main detective and D.A. are also women, this could have turned into a very anti-male film. It is not. To be a sexual predator IS gender neutral. The nudity of this film is not erotic. The rape is brutal not sexual."|1
"Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much. The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi, Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast. The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called ""Good"". We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey? Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers? A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewer-ship."|1
I guess my husband and I are a little slow . We do n't usually warm up to a series of movies until the very last one . I've noticed that after you've seen all 12 of these movies it takes about 3-4 hours to watch the last one . This movie got me thinking. Why was there not more sex scenes? Is it because of the storyline or is it because of the nudity? Or both? The sex scenes were great. They didn't seem overly sexual in any way . I thought they were really hot .|0
In the midst of a documentary about his parents , the filmmaker 's mother dies , but he continues making films. One such film is about a guy who moves back in with his father and has to deal with the fact that his step-mother is dead by the time he was born. The film doesn't go far, but does a good job of explaining why people make these mistakes. I am a die-hard fan of Robert Altman's career. He has managed to put together some of the most compelling and engaging movies of the past 35 years.|0
I went straight to the big screen to view this kicker . This is the only flick that I know of that makes you cringe at every second of it..It has a very weak beginning , which goes on for about 5-10 minutes. It then slows down enough for you to stop and appreciate what is taking place, but there is still a lot more to be seen. By the end you are so emotionally invested in the story, that you can't look away or watch anything else. The acting is pretty mediocre too...not bad, but nothing special either.|0
Having read the other comment about this superb piece of TV drama I felt compelled to balance things a little so that I could give it a 4/10.The reason for this is that there seems to be a tendency among some viewers to write off any show they don't feel like watching as 'not worth watching' without looking into what's behind it. This is a very common phenomenon, often by people who just want to see something cool and exciting without making too much effort.I'll confess that I have watched this programme twice. In fact, I was only on the second time after reading the comments here.|0
Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years , Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of the documentary format for nearly a decade now. In his latest attempt at making a movie called, The Search for Everything, Herzog takes the audience along for the ride as they learn all about the life and work of famous German physicist Werner Heisenberg. What makes this movie so intriguing is the fact that there are literally no plotlines in the film whatsoever. It seems to have been largely created by Herzog himself. I just don't understand it.|0
This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well. The movie was probably a 7/10 but it had some good music so I gave it an extra point. Yeah, worth watching. I know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is - the one that appears when she is in the car crash.|1
